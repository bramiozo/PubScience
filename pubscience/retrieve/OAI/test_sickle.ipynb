Most likely, the cause of the rise in allergic diseases must be sought in environmental factors. In this respect, the suggestion that a change in the level and the kind of early childhood infections would be factor influencing the development of allergic diseases has drawn most attention and discussion. This suggested relationship between hygiene and allergic disease is called the \\x93hygiene hypothesis\\x94. Basically, this hypothesis states that improved hygiene in industrialized societies, with improved public health measures and the use of vaccines and antibiotics has reduced the incidence of infections that normally stimulate the immune system in some way that mitigates against asthma. In line with the hygiene hypothesis it has been suggested that mycobacteria can be used as an \\x93anti-asthma\\x94 vaccine. In this thesis, the potential of a heat-killed preparation of M. vaccae (SRL172) was evaluated. \\r\\nFirst, in chapter 2 to 4, it was shown that administration of M. vaccae suppresses allergic and asthmatic responses in a mouse model during, but also after, the onset of allergic disease. Importantly, M. vaccae must be administered during allergen exposure to be effective in our model. This may have important implications for the application of M. vaccae in humans. The contradictive results in clinical trails using M. vaccae, but also BCG, may be due to the duration and/or the level of exposure to allergens during the treatment period. \\r\\nSecondly, in chapter 5, we hypothesized that genes controlling the resistance to bacterial infections can influence the development of allergic diseases as well. The Nramp1 gene is one of the best characterized genes controlling resistance to intracellular infections. Therefore, it was studied whether Nramp1 alleles, that determine resistance to intracellular bacteria, affect the sensitivity to the induction of allergic asthma as well. It was demonstrated that the Nramp1 gene affects the development of allergic, but not the development of asthmatic manifestations in a mouse model. In our opinion, Nramp1 may now be considered as a potential locus for susceptibility for allergy and allergic disease. Moreover, Nramp1 could provide a link between genes, the (bacterial) environment and the development of allergy. \\r\\nFinally, it was investigated in chapter 6 whether Nramp1 may be involved in treatment of allergic disease with heat-killed M. vaccae as well. It was demonstrated that Nramp1 indeed affected the efficacy of M. vaccae in reducing the allergic and asthmatic response. In addition, Nramp1 affected the macrophage activation after M. vaccae treatment and maybe as a result, Nramp1 affected T cell-mediated immune response to M. vaccae. \\r\\nIn summary, this thesis shows that the macrophage, which function is determined by Nramp1, may play a crucial role in the downregulation by mycobacteria of allergic and asthmatic responses. The macrophage, whose activation is regulated by Nramp1, seems to be a key cell connecting innate, natural immunity with the adaptive, cellular immunity, and therefore might be an important target for the treatment of asthma.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['The Correspondence between Descartes and Henricus Regius'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['In 1638 the Dutch philosopher and physician Henricus Regius (1598 1679) introduced himself to René Descartes (1596 1650), allegedly because he owed his appointment as professor of theoretical medicine at Utrecht University to his being a Cartesian. During the following years Regius established himself as the main advocate of Cartesianism at Utrecht. In fact, he was the first university professor to teach Cartesian ideas and to publish a number of disputations, which provide a fairly complete picture of Cartesian natural philosophy. \\r\\n\\r\\nApart from De Vrijer s theological thesis of 1917 little has been done so far to establish the significance of Regius  work or study the way in which he took up Descartes  ideas and amalgamated them with his own. Although the necessary sources have become available in the past decades, there is as yet no comprehensive study on Regius and his relation to Descartes. A major obstacle to this enterprise is the defective state of the available editions of the Descartes Regius correspondence. For a clear understanding of the relation between Descartes and Regius, and for an objective and thorough assessment of Regius  philosophical and medical concepts, a critical edition of the correspondence between Descartes and Regius is an essential prerequisite. It is here where the problems arise. The actual text of the letters which were exchanged between Descartes and Regius is unknown. In 1657, Claude Clerselier published 18 minutes of Descartes  part of the correspondence. All that remains of Regius  letters to Descartes are abstracts and quotations in Adrien Baillet s biography, published in 1691. In 1973, Esze published two unknown letters of Descartes to Regius. The order of the letters as they were published in the editions of Adam/Tannery (1964 1971: AT), Adam/Milhaud (1936 1963), Rodis-Lewis (1959) and Bordoli (1997) is based on that of Clerselier, but since the rediscovery of Regius  disputations Physiologia (1641) scholars have contested the dates of various letters. However, none of the editors so far has extensively used Regius  disputations as a means to arrive at a more exact date.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe aim of my research is to provide a critical reconstruction of the correspondence between Descartes and Regius. The most dramatic differences with previous editions concern Descartes  part of the correspondence. I have discovered that several letters as published by Clerselier consist in fact of fragments of many more letters. Further, I have revised almost every date established by AT, either narrowing them down or giving the letters an altogether new place in the correspondence. One of the most interesting features of the present edition is that it points out the many reoccurring passages from Descartes  letters in Regius  Physiologia (the complete text of the first three disputations of the Physiologia is given in an appendix). As regards Regius  letters to Descartes, in many cases I have been able to establish their precise date. Moreover, in clearing Baillet s at times confused way of presentation, I have arrived at an order of Regius  letters and their context which sharply contrasts with the standard view. In addition, my examination of Baillet s biography has yielded several passages relevant to Regius  letters which are not found in AT. Finally, the use of the many available sources, both published and unpublished, has resulted in a comprehensive historical annotation, conspicuously absent in AT, on the specific Dutch and especially Utrecht context of the relation between Regius and Descartes.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['A quantitative structure property relationship (QSPR) for a,b-unsaturated carboxylates\\n(mainly acrylates and methacrylates) was established in chapter 2. Chemical reaction rate\\nconstants were measured for 12 different chemicals with three different nucleophiles, namely\\nH 2 O, OH - and glutathione (GSH). Relatively small differences were found in hydrolysis\\nrates (reaction with H 2 O and OH - ). At an elevated pH (8.8) the hydrolysis half-life of the\\ncompound ranged between 7 and 40 days, with exception of diethyl fumarate (0.4 day). A\\nseparation in two groups was observed for the reaction with GSH (Michael addition), where\\nacrylates reacted approximately 100 times as fast as methacrylates. This difference was con-\\nsistent with differences found in electronic structure, which was determined by quantum-\\nchemical calculations. Because no single parameter could describe the electrophilic charac-\\nter of the unsaturated carboxylates satisfactory, four descriptors were pooled, using a\\nmultivariate correlation (partial least squares regression, PLS). The resulting QSPR for\\nMichael addition was able to predict the reactivity of structurally related, unsaturated\\ncarboxylates.\\nAcute fish toxicity of a set of acrylates and methacrylates was evaluated in chapter 3.\\nPublished four-day LC 50 data for fathead minnow were compared to the chemical reactivity\\nof the compounds towards GSH, because Michael addition was expected to be the mecha-\\nnism that causes harmful binding to essential biological thiol-sites in the fish (e. g. proteins\\nand enzymes). A simple equation was used to model the interaction of electrophilic chemi-\\ncals with GSH. The degree of GSH depletion, which was used to estimate the toxic effect,\\nwas found to be related to the product of aqueous exposure concentration and chemical\\nreaction rate of the reactive compound. Although, all acrylates and methacrylates poten-\\ntially could react with GSH, narcosis was judged to be an alternative mode of toxic action\\nresponsible for the observed acute toxicity. Potencies for GSH depletion and narcosis were\\ncompared on the bases of critical body residues and critical depletion rates. Five out of 12\\ncompounds were thereby identified as narcosis chemicals on the bases of their high calcu-\\nlated lethal body burden. It was concluded that, although the tested chemicals all contained\\na similar functional group, their mode of action regarding acute fish toxicity was not the\\nsame. Therefore, a correlation between chemical reaction rate and LC 50 for the whole test set\\nof chemicals would not be meaningful.\\nThe results from chapter 3 indicated, that narcosis was an interfering mode of action in\\nQSARÕs for fish toxicity of reactive chemicals. To evaluate this hypothesis, data of reactive\\nchemicals from three different classes (unsaturated carboxylates, organophosphorus esters?126 Chapter 8 Summary and General Discussion\\nand nitrobenzenes) were taken from the literature and subjected to an analysis for multiple\\nmodes of action (chapter 4). The Toxic ratio, being the ratio between the observed LC 50 and\\nthe LC 50 , predicted for the same compound by a narcosis QSAR was used to estimate the\\nprobability of a compound to act by narcosis. In total, 40 % of the 61 compounds tested were\\nidentified as Òprobably acting by narcosisÓ. For these compounds, a narcosis QSAR using\\nthe octanol/water partitioning coefficient (K OW ) as sole descriptor was found to describe\\nthe toxicity. QSARÕs using reactivity descriptors, which in earlier work had been found\\ninsufficient to describe the toxicity of these classes of compounds improved considerably, if\\nthe Ònarcotic chemicalsÓ were excluded from the data sets. It was concluded, that narcosis\\nshould always be considered as a possible alternative cause of death in acute fish toxicity\\ntest, even if the chemicals seem to have a very specific mode of action. Additionally, it was\\nshown, that QSARÕs should only be established for sets of chemicals with an identical mode\\nof action. Modes of action clearly should not be confused with functional groups.\\nThe toxic effect of acrylates and methacrylates on a cellular level were investigated in\\nchapter 5. Cellular glutathione (GSH) concentrations were recorded in isolated cells of rat\\nlivers. These cells have a continuous high expression of GSH and a broad range of metabo-\\nlism. Potentially toxic metabolites of the acrylates and methacrylates were therefore likely\\nto be produced in these cells. Furthermore, the additivity of the toxic effect of these chemi-\\ncals was investigated in this in-vitro test. For each chemical, an EC 50 for GSH depletion was\\ndetermined and used as an effect equivalent to compare their potencies. By testing two\\nmixtures, each containing six individual chemicals, it could be shown that the depletion of\\nGSH was dose-additive. This means that in a mixture of acrylates and methacrylates each\\nindividual chemical will contribute to the total toxic effect of the mixture. As expected, the\\ncompounds were metabolized by the hepatocytes. For one of them, allyl methacrylate, the\\nvery toxic metabolic product acrolein could be identified in the cell-culture medium. The\\nproduction of this metabolite is most probably responsible for the high toxicity of this spe-\\ncific compound towards the liver cells as well as towards fish (chapter 3).\\nA preliminary physiologically based pharmacokinetic and -dynamic model (PBPK-PD)\\nfor ethyl acrylate (EA) was presented in chapter 6. It was based on an existing PBPK model\\nfor inert compounds in fish, which had been established by the US-EPA in Duluth, MN ( 1,\\n2). The model was adapted to be used with EA by adding elimination processes in several\\ntissue compartments. Elimination rates of EA, which had been measured in-vitro, were\\nextrapolated to whole organs. The turnover of GSH in the gills was modeled separately and\\nwas used to describe the toxic effect of EA on biological targets. Once the model was estab-?lished, several aspects of an aqueous exposure scenario were investigated. The uptake of\\nEA in different organs of the fish was predicted to occur very rapidly (steady state concen-\\ntrations reached in minutes to a few hours) with exception of the fat tissue. The metabolic\\nelimination of EA in the gills was not sufficient to cause a notable first pass effect. Conse-\\nquently, the EA concentration in the gill tissue was predicted to be almost instantaneously\\nat equilibrium with the aqueous exposure concentration. The EA concentration in the gills\\nwas subsequently used in the biological effect sub-model to describe the depletion of GSH.\\nFor a simulated exposure scenario close to a lethal aqueous concentration, the GSH concen-\\ntration in the gills decreased by 60 % during the first 6 hours. This forecast was in agree-\\nment with experimental observations. In contrast to an existing rat model for EA, the trout\\nmodel did not predict a first pass elimination of EA and therefore a systemic distribution\\ncan be expected in the fish. In both models, however, a local depletion of the GSH level at\\nthe site of adsorption was evident.\\nIn chapter 7, several findings from the previous chapters were combined to postulate an\\nelementary approach to model toxic effects of reactive chemicals in aquatic organisms. The\\nmost important simplification of this approach was, to disregard the pharmacokinetics of\\nmoderately hydrophobic reactive chemical in aquatic organisms. This resulted in a elemen-\\ntary pharmacodynamic model (EPD), which describes a target and the interaction of a reac-\\ntive chemical with this target. This approach can be used to describe time and concentration\\ndependent toxicological effects. Models, based on this approach were found to give excel-\\nlent description of experimental data on acetylcholine-esterase inhibition due to OP-esters\\nin several aquatic animals. The approach was also able to predict time dependent effect\\nconcentrations (e. g. LC 50 ). Under certain conditions, the EPD model can be reduced to an\\nequivalent of HaberÕs Law, which states that the product of concentration and exposure\\ntime will be constant. In addition to this, the EPD model can give a rational interpretation of\\nthreshold concentration, which are often observed in toxicity experiments.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Tropical forests are threatened world-wide. Therefore, there is a search for ways to use the forests in a sustainable way, as this could assist in the conservation of these special ecosystems. Non-timber products collected from trees in tropical forests are\\r\\n   often mentioned as examples of sustainable exploitation. Their collection causes far less disturbance to forest structure and\\r\\n   functioning than the felling of trees for timber. This PhD thesis reports on ecological studies on tree species exploited for\\r\\n   non-timber products. Three tree species were investigated in the tropical forests of the Bolivian Amazon region. The\\r\\n   demography of these species is analysed and the impact of exploitation on population dynamics and future productivity is\\r\\n   assessed. Use is made of matrix population models to analyse the population dynamics of the study species. Two of the three\\r\\n   investigated species yield products with good prospects for sustainable extraction (Brazil nuts and palm leaves), whereas the\\r\\n   palm heart collected from the third species offers little potential for sustained use. Brazil nuts have been collected from the\\r\\n   emergent tree Bertholletia excelsa for decades in the region, without a clear negative impact. In spite of the fact that around 90%\\r\\n   of the seeds are harvested, seedlings can be found in reasonable densities and demographic models predict a stable size and a\\r\\n   continued rejuvenation of exploited populations. The Brazil nut tree may reach an age of over 300 yr, and becomes reproductive\\r\\n   only at the age of 120-140 yr. Therefore, if there would be an effect of nut collection on future nut production, this would only\\r\\n   become apparent after several decades. Leaves of the small understorey palm Geonoma deversa are cut for high-quality\\r\\n   thatching material. The collection of leaves does not infer permanent damage to the plant, and all harvested leaves are replaced\\r\\n   by new ones in approximately three years. Reproductive activity (flowering, fruiting and cloning) is strongly reduced after leaf\\r\\n   cutting, but defoliation did not cause an elevated mortality risk. Population growth was only moderately reduced after leaf\\r\\n   cutting. Model results show that the availability of leaves at population level recovers rapidly after simulated harvests. When\\r\\n   harvests are repeated once every 16 years, leaf availability may be sustained at reasonable levels. The third product, palm heart,\\r\\n   is collected from the canopy palm Euterpe precatoria. Collecting palm heart - the meristem of the plant - involves the cutting of\\r\\n   the entire reproductive individual, and thus causes the death of the individual. As reproductive individuals of this species are\\r\\n   approximately 90 yr in age, exploitation has a strongly negative impact on the population. Cut palms have to be replaced from\\r\\n   seeds, as the species does not reproduce by clonal propagation. Demographic models show that the survival of adult palms is\\r\\n   crucial to sustain population growth, and model simulations show that the availability of palm heart can only be sustained when\\r\\n   a low proportion of reproductive individuals is cut and populations are left undisturbed for long periods between harvests. The\\r\\n   current harvest practice - cutting around 90% of the adults and repeating this as soon as possible - clearly can not be sustained\\r\\n   for longer periods. In addition, the thesis contains two chapters focusing on technical aspects related to the type of\\r\\n   demographic models used for the case studies - matrix population models. An additional type of sensitivity analysis for matrix\\r\\n   models is presented, which takes into account the inherent variability in demographic rates.

       "  'Description': ['Upon primary pathogen attack, plants activate a diverse array of defense mechanisms at the site of primary\\r\\n   infection. Besides this so-called basal resistance, plants have also the ability to enhance their defensive capacity\\r\\n   against future pathogen attack. There are at least two types of biologically induced resistance. Classic systemic\\r\\n   acquired resistance (SAR) results from infection by a necrotizing pathogen and is dependent on endogenous\\r\\n   accumulation of salicylic acid (SA). Root colonization by non-pathogenic rhizobacteria can trigger an induced\\r\\n   systemic resistance (ISR) response as well. The ISR signaling pathway differs from the SAR pathway, in that\\r\\n   ISR functions independently of SA, but requires intact responsiveness to the plant hormones jasmonic acid (JA)\\r\\n   and ethylene. Using the naturally occurring variation in ISR inducibility and basal resistance against the bacterial\\r\\n   leaf pathogen P. syringae pv. tomato (Pst) in Arabidopsis, a dominant locus (ISR1) on chromosome III was\\r\\n   identified that controls both ISR inducibility and basal resistance against Pst. Further physiological analysis\\r\\n   revealed that genotypes carrying the recessive alleles of this alleles exhibit a reduced sensitivity to ethylene,\\r\\n   indicating that the ISR1 gene encodes an ethylene signaling component that plays an important role in disease\\r\\n   resistance. Additionally, we tested 11 Arabidopsis mutants with enhanced disease susceptibility to P. syringae\\r\\n   pathogens for their ability to express ISR and SAR. In this screen we identified three Eds genes (Eds4, Eds8 and\\r\\n   Eds10) that are involved in ISR, and two genes (Eds5 and Eds12) that are involved in SAR. The ISR-impaired\\r\\n   mutants were found to be impaired in JA/ethylene-dependent signaling, whereas the SAR-impaired mutants were\\r\\n   affected in SA-dependent signaling. To further examine the relationship between basal resistance and induced\\r\\n   resistance, we assessed the effectiveness of SAR and ISR against different pathogens that are resisted through\\r\\n   either SA-dependent basal defenses, or JA/ethylene-dependent basal defenses. SAR was highly effective against\\r\\n   the oomycete Peronospora parasitica and turnip crinkle virus (TCV), which are both resisted through\\r\\n   SA-dependent basal defenses, whereas ISR yielded only weak or no protection, respectively. Conversely, ISR\\r\\n   was highly effective against Alternaria brassicicola, which is resisted through JA-dependent basal resistance,\\r\\n   whereas SAR yielded no protection against this fungus. The bacterial pathogens P. syringae and Xanthomonas\\r\\n   campestris that are both resisted through a combined action of SA- and JA/ethylene-dependent basal resistance,\\r\\n   were sensitive to both ISR and ISR. Collectively, our results indicate that ISR is achieved by an enhancement of\\r\\n   JA/ethylene-dependent basal resistance, whereas SAR is achieved by an enhancement of SA-dependent basal\\r\\n   resistance. This conclusion points to a model in which induced resistance is expressed as a potentiation of either\\r\\n   JA/ethylene dependent basal defenses (ISR), or SA-dependent basal defenses (SAR) upon challenge with a\\r\\n   pathogen.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Bij vrouwen na de menopause is er een sterke daling van de oestradiol\\nconcentraties in het bloed. Hoewel oestradiol oorspronkelijk alleen beschouwd\\nwerd als een geslachtshormoon, heeft dit hormoon ook invloed op een groot aantal\\nandere organen, waaronder het skelet, het cardiovasculaire systeem en het centrale\\nzenuwstelsel. Een van de meest dramatische gevolgen van de daling van de\\nbloedspiegel van dit hormoon is een toename van de botresorptie die kan leiden tot\\nosteoporose. Een effectieve behandeling van deze conditie is mogelijk door middel\\nvan een Hormoon Vervangings Therapie (HVT) waarin het deficiente oestradiol\\nwordt gesupplementeerd door toediening van een oestrogeen. Een nadeel van deze\\noestrogenen is dat de incidentie van borst- en endometrium kanker toeneemt. Dit\\nverschijnsel lijkt gerelateerd te zijn aan de stimulatie door oestrogenen van de\\nproliferatie in de borst en het endometrium. Deze twee organen zijn zeer gevoelig\\nvoor oestrogenen. Om de oestrogeen gestimuleerde proliferatie in de borst en het\\nendometrium tegen te gaan, wordt daarom vaak een progestageen aan HVT\\ntoegevoegd. Door deze combinatie wil men bereiken dat het gewenste oestrogene\\neffect op het bot blijft bestaan, terwijl de ongewenste proliferatie in de borst en het\\nendometrium wordt onderdrukt door het progestageen.\\nHet effect van de de steroiden die gebruikt worden in HVT op de organen die\\ndoor deze therapie beinvloed worden (doelweefsels) is afhankelijk van een groot\\naantal factoren. De belangrijkste hiervan zijn achtereenvolgens: de beschikbaarheid\\nvan de steroiden in het weefsel, de soort en concentratie van steroid receptoren die\\naanwezig zijn in het doelweefsel en de aanwezigheid van eiwitten die betroken zijn\\nbij de co-activatie/co-repressie van steroid receptoren. In dit proefschrift\\nconcentreerden we ons op de eerste stap in deze cascade. De beschikbaarheid van\\neen circulerend steroid hormoon in een doelweefsel wordt bepaald door de\\nopname uit de bloedbaan en het metabolisme in dat weefsel. Het steroid\\nmetabolisme in het weefsel kan leiden tot een activatie of een inactivatie van het\\nsteroid hormoon. Een voorbeeld van steroid hormoon activatie door metabolisme\\nin het doelweefsel is de omzetting van testosterone naar het sterkere androgeen 5-dihydrotestosterone\\nin de prostaat. Een andere mogelijkheid is dat door\\nmetabolisme een steroid wordt gevormd dat affiniteit heeft voor een andere steroid\\nreceptor. De aromatisering van C19 androgenen tot C18 oestrogen door het enzym\\naromatase in b.v. vetweefsel is hier een goed voorbeeld van.\\nHet is goed denkbaar dat de steroiden die gebruikt worden bij HVT op een\\nvergelijkbare manier worden gemataboliseerd in de verschillende doelweefsels. In\\ndit proefschrift werd daarom een studie gedaan naar het vermogen van een aantal\\ngeselecteerde doelweefsels voor HVT (uterus, vagina en aorta) om een aantal\\noestrogenen en progestagenen te metaboliseren. De oestrogen die werden\\nbestudeerd zijn oestradiol, ethynylestradiol (17-ethynyl-estadiol) en moxestrol\\n(11-methoxy-17-ethynyl-estradiol). De progestagenen die werden bestudeerd zijn\\nnorethisteron (NET) en een aantal derivaten van NET. De derivaten van NET zijn\\nOrg OM38 (7-methyl-NET), Org 4060 (11-ethyl-NET) en Org 34694 (7- methyl,11-ethylidene-NET). Op deze wijze kon de invloed van een 17-ethynyl en\\n11-methoxy substituent op het metabolisme in HVT doelweefsels van oestradiol\\nbepaald worden. Evenzo kon de invloed op het metabolisme worden bepaald van\\neen kleine lipofiele substitutie op de 7 en 11-positie van norethisterone. Bovendien\\nwerd ook het metabolisme bestudeerd van Org OD14 (ook bekend als livial of\\ntibolone), een steroid met zowel oestrogene, progestagene en androgene\\neigenschapen. Van Org OD14 is bekend dat het effectief is als een oestrogeen\\nagonist op bot, maar geen stimulatie van het endometrium veroorzaakt vanwege de\\nvorming in het endometrium van een metaboliet met progestagene eigenschappen.\\nDe geovariectomeerde (ovx) rat wordt beschouwd als een goed model om de\\npathogenese en behandeling van osteoporose bij postmenopausale vrouwen te\\nbestuderen. Het is echter minder duidelijk of de ovx rat ook vergelijkbaar is met de\\nmens als het gaat om effecten van HVT op andere weefsels dan het bot. Omdat\\nmetabolisme in doelweefsel een belangrijke invloed heeft op de werking van\\nsteroiden werd onderzocht of het metabolisme van de geselecteerd steroiden in de\\nrat vergelijkbaar is met dat in postmenopausale vrouwen\\nhoewel er in zowel de uterus als de vagina van de ovx rat sprake is van oxidatie\\nvan de 17-OH groep door 17-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17-HSD) en\\nconjugatie van de 3-OH groep bleek het metabolisme van oestradiol in de uterus en\\nvagina van de ovx rat sterk te verschillen van dat in de mens. De regulatie door\\nestradiol en progesteron van de 17-HSD activiteit en de conjugatie van estradiol\\nin de ovx rat uterus was tegenovergesteld aan dat in de humane uterus. Bovendien\\nbleek dat er in de rat uterus sprake is van een conjugatie van estradiol tot een\\nglucuronide, terwijl in de humane uterus 3-sulfaten worden gevormd. De regulatie\\ndoor estradiol en progesteron van het estradiol metabolisme was alleen duidelijk in\\nde uterus; in de vagina had behandeling met deze hormonen geen invloed. De 17-ethynyl\\ngroep verhinderde zoals te verwachten de oxidatie van ethynylestradiol\\ndoor 17-HSD, terwijl de 11-methoxy substitutie van moxestrol de\\nglucuronidering bleek te verhinderen. Er werd geen metabolisme van oestrogenen\\nwaargenomen in de rat aorta (hoofdstuk 1).\\nOok het metabolisme van NET in de uterus en vagina van de rat en de mens\\nbleek verschillend te zijn. In beide soorten was 5-reductie de bepalende stap voor\\nhet metabolisme van norethisteron. De 3-keto groep van het gevormde 5-H-NET\\nwerd in de vagina van beide soorten verder gereduceerd. Echter, in de vagina van\\npostmenopausale vrouwen werd er zowel 3-OH, 5-H-NET als 3-OH, 5-H-NET\\ngevormd, terwijl in de rat er voornamelijk 3-OH, 5-H-NET werd gevormd. Ook\\nin de rat uterus en aorta werd voornamelijk 3-OH, 5-H-NET gevormd terwijl er\\nnauwelijks NET metabolisme was in de uterus van postmenopausale vrouwen. De\\nverschillen tussen rat en mens in vorming van 5-gereduceerde en 3,5 / 3,5-gereduceerde\\nmetaboliten van NET is van belang omdat 5-reductie van NET de\\naffiniteit van NET voor de progesteron receptor teniet doet. Bovendien vertonen\\n3,5 en 3,5 gereduceerde metabolieten van NET affiniteit voor de oestrogeen receptor en worden zij ook geassocieerd met in vivo en in vitro oestrogene activiteit.\\nDit laatste geldt in sterkere mate voor 3,5-NET dan voor 3,5-NET. Zowel de\\n7-methyl als de 11-ethyl stubstitutie van Org OM38 en Org 4060, respectivelijk,\\nverhinderde de 5-reductie in beide soorten alsook in HEK293 cellen die humaan\\n5-reductase type 1 of 2 tot expressie brengen (hoofdstuk 3 en 4).\\nDe voorkeur voor 3-reductie in de rat werd ook duidelijk in de studies met Org\\nOD14. In uterus, vagina en aorta van de rat werd de 3-keto groep van Org OD14\\nomgezet tot 3-OH Org OD14 (Org 4094). In de uterus en vagina van\\npostmenopauale vrouwen daarentegen werd Org OD14 omgezet tot 3-OH-Org\\nOD14 (Org 30126) en tot de 4 isomeer van Org OD14 (Org OM38). Hieruit volgt\\ndat het beschermende effect van Org OD14 op het endometrium door de vorming\\nvan het progestagene Org OM38 niet zal optreden in de rat. In de rat uterus, vagina\\nen aorta werd Org 30126 ook omgezet naar Org 4094 met Org OD14 als\\ntussenproduct. In de humane weefsels werd Org 30126 niet omgezet (hoofdstuk 5).\\nIn dit proefschrift worden belanrijke verschillen aangetoond tussen de rat en de\\nmens voor wat betreft het metabolisme van oestradiol, norethisteron en Org OD14\\nin enkele doelweefsels van HVT. Deze verschillen maken de rat minder geschikt\\nvoor het bestuderen van effecten op deze doelweefsels van de genoemde steroiden.\\nBovendien werd gevonden dat substitutie met een 7-methyl of een 11-ethyl\\ngroep de 5-reductie van norethisteron verhinderd. Gezien de verschillen tussen de\\nrat en de mens is het wellicht beter om in vitro systemen te ontwikkelen om het\\nmetabolisme van vergelikbare steroiden in HVT doelweefsel te testen. Hierbij zal\\nverdere kennis van de expressie van de enzymen die betrokken zijn bij dit\\nmetabolisme onontbeerlijk zijn (hoofdstuk 6).'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Summary electronic version \\x95 I\\nEvery organism experiences the effects of stress in its day to day life.\\nStress can be defined as any disturbance of the organism\\x92s homeostasis.The inter-nal\\nor external stimulus that causes stress is called the stressor. Usually, the organ-ism\\nis well equipped to adapt to the stress. It has the mechanisms, generally\\nreferred to as the stress response, to restore its disturbed homeostasis. However,\\nsevere and chronic stress may exceed the ability to adapt and this may then lead\\nto suppression of growth, the immune response or the reproductive perform-ance.\\nIn fish, as in higher vertebrates, stress adaptation has been shown to be\\nrelated to an activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal (HPI) axis. In\\nteleost fish, cortisol is the main glucocorticoid produced by the interrenals\\nunder influence of stress. Cortisol plays a key role in the restoration of home-ostasis\\nand is frequently indicated to be the major factor mediating the suppres-sive\\neffect of stress on the reproductive performance.\\nThis thesis addresses the effect of stress adaptation on the pubertal development.\\nPuberty is the developmental process by which the animal acquires the capaci-ty\\nto reproduce. In males, the period of pubertal development may be defined as\\nthe time span that starts with the beginning of spermatogonial multiplication\\nuntil the appearance of the first flagellated spermatozoa. The onset and regula-tion\\nof puberty is determined by functional development of the brain-pituitary-gonad\\n(BPG) axis. Stress effects have been reported to affect all levels of the\\nBPG-axis. However, the precise mechanisms via which the stress response has its\\nadverse effects on reproduction are still unknown.\\nThe present study is an attempt to find more answers to solve this\\nintriguing question. Firstly, we investigated the effects of repeated temperature\\nstress on the pubertal development (Chapter 2). Since cortisol has been shown\\nto play a key role in the homeostatic adaptation during or after stress, we\\nfocussed in chapter 3 on the effects of cortisol on the pubertal development. In\\nthe same chapter we also paid attention to the question at which level the BPG-axis\\nis affected by cortisol. Since our results indicate that all levels of the BPG-axis\\nwere affected by cortisol, we studied the cortisol effects on the pituitary and?the testis in more detail (chapter 4 and in chapter 5) and tried to answer the\\nquestion whether cortisol has its effects, directly or indirectly on the different\\ncomponents of the BPG-axis. Based on these studies we hypothesized that the\\ncortisol-induced suppression of pubertal development is mediated by effects on\\nthe androgen production. In the following chapter, chapter 6, we therefore\\nintensified our research on the testis, focussing on the steroid synthesis. Finally,\\nin chapter 7, we investigated the role of the androgens, which possibly play a key\\nrole in the cortisol-induced suppression of pubertal development, by combined\\ncortisol treatment and steroid replacement therapy.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The research described in this thesis concerns transport processes in coats of developing pea seeds. The scope\\n   of the investigation ranges from seed coat anatomy, via transport studies to the cloning of cDNA encoding\\n   proteinaceous membrane pores, and the heterologous expression of these proteins to analyse their function.\\n   Pea seed coats do not have an extensive vascular web. Nevertheless, assimilates imported from the mother plant\\n   are distributed throughout the entire seed coat. The transport pathway of assimilates through the seed coat\\n   towards the embryo was envisaged by using the fluorescent symplast tracer pyranine. Besides, cryo scanning\\n   electron microscopy revealed an extensive web of liquid filled intercellular spaces, which facilitate transport from\\n   the site of unloading to the cotyledons. \\n   It has been postulated that the unloading of sugars and amino acids from pea seed coat parenchyma cells is\\n   mediated by poorly selective, proteinaceous pores. To investigate whether electrically charged molecules can be\\n   transported via the same pathway, the uptake of the organic cation choline, and the amino acid histidine were\\n   characterised. The results indicate that cations may indeed be transported by the same pore as neutral solutes.\\n   The idea of poorly selective pores lead to the formulation of the Supply follows Demand model, which offers a\\n   simple concept for the regulation of assimilate unloading in the seed coat. \\n   Solutes that are unloaded into the apoplast are transported from the mother plant to the seed coat by the phloem.\\n   Together with these solutes, water is imported into the seed coat. This has to be released from the seed coat\\n   parenchyma cells again. Therefore, membrane transport of solutes and water across the seed coat parenchyma\\n   plasma membrane strongly influence each other. Major Intrinsic Proteins (MIPs) may be involved in the\\n   entwined processes of water and solute transport. To examine the presence of MIPs in pea seed coats, a seed\\n   coat cDNA library was screened for MIP clones. Four clones were isolated, and their expression patterns in the\\n   plant were investigated. To determine the permeability for water and solutes, the four pea MIPs were functionally\\n   assayed after heterologous expression in Xenopus oocytes.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Regulation of cytosolic Phospholipase A2 activity plays a central role in cell responses'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Phospholipases A2 are enzymes that hydrolyse fatty acids from the sn-2 position of phospholipids, resulting in the release of free fatty acids and lysophospholipids. The sn-2 position of phospholipids in mammalian cells is enriched with arachidonic acid, which is a substrate for cyclooxygenases, lipoxygenases and cytochrome p450s, giving PLA2s an important role in the control of the synthesis of prostaglandins, leukotrienes and other eicosanoids. Arachidonic acid and its metabolites, the eicosanoids, have been implicated in a number of physiological and pathophysiological processes and is preferentially released by cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), implicating that cPLA2 activity has to be tightly regulated. The aim of this thesis was to gain more insight in the regulation of cPLA2 in mitogen- and oxidative stress-induced cells, as well as in continuously cycling cells. Furthermore, the possible role of cPLA2 and the downstream arachidonic acid metabolising enzymes, cyclooxygenases and lipoxygenases, in cell cycle progression was investigated. The studies described in chapters 2, and 3 show that cPLA2 is activated through different signal transduction pathways depending on the stimulus in the extracellular environment. In response to epidermal growth factor (EGF), cPLA2 is predominantly activated through PKC-MEK-p42/44MAPK, while serum-induced cPLA2 activity is mainly mediated via the Raf-MEK-p42/44MAPK pathway. In contrast, direct activation of PKC by phorbol ester (PdBu) did not result in increased cPLA2 activity, while p42/44MAPK was activated via Raf-MEK and through MEK. Activation of cPLA2 by the oxidant hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is partly mediated via Raf-MEK-p42/44MAPK and partly through a phosphorylation-independent mechanism involving peroxidised phospholipids. These results suggest that activation of cPLA2 is not only governed by post-translational modifications but, more importantly, by localisation of the signal transduction components at a certain time that determines whether cPLA2, at which place and what time cPLA2 will be activated. The cellular localisation of signal transduction components determines whether cPLA2 will be activated. However, understanding the function of cPLA2 in cells requires also knowledge of the activation of cPLA2 in a temporal manner. Therefore, the activity and function of cPLA2 was investigated during the ongoing cell cycle as described in chapters 4 and 5. cPLA2 activity was high in mitosis, decreasing rapidly in early G1. A small increase was observed in mid/late G1, followed by a strong increase at the G1/S transition. These changes in cPLA2 activity were not due to differences in cPLA2 protein expression, but due to p42/44MAPK mediated phosphorylation of the enzyme. Inhibition of cPLA2 activity in early G1 phase using ATK, an inhibitor for cPLA2, resulted in a marked reduction in DNA synthesis. Furthermore, inhibition of cyclooxygenases at different time points after mitosis did not have any effect on cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase, whereas inhibition of lipoxygenases resulted in G1 phase arrest. Moreover, lipoxygenases are pivotal for S phase progression, since no DNA synthesis occurred when lipoxygenases were inhibited. Thus it is important to understand the mechanism and function of cPLA2 regulation for the development and therapeutic use of drugs.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['The role of ethylene perception in plant disease resistance'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Ethylene is a plant hormone that is involved in responses of the plant to various stress situations, such as pathogen attack. The role of ethylene in plant-pathogen interactions seems to be diverse. Exposure of plants to ethylene can induce disease resistance, but treatment with ethylene during disease development can also increase symptom development. \\nTransgenic, ethylene-insensitive tobacco plants (Tetr) that are grown in normal potting soil spontaneously develop wilting and stem rot, whereas tobacco plants that are not transformed do not. Various fungi and were isolated from such diseased Tetr tobacco plants. These isolates caused disease in Tetr tobacco when inoculated onto plants growing in soil that was sterilized by autoclaving. Non-transformed tobacco developed less severe or no disease at all when inoculated in a similar manner. Similarly, in Arabidopsis ethylene-insensitive mutants appeared to be more susceptible to these microorganisms than wild-type plants. These results indicate that in tobacco and Arabidopsis similar resistance mechanisms are impaired by insensitivity to ethylene. In addition, it was demonstrated that Tetr tobacco allows more growth of Pythium than non-transformed plants. \\nA culturing-independent, molecular approach was used to examine microorganisms that colonize Tetr plants growing in potting soil. Using specific primers for PCR, bacterial, fungal, and oomycete populations were examined in roots of non-transformed and Tetr plants, growing either in non-autoclaved or autoclaved soil. Before the onset of disease development, plants growing in non-autoclaved soil contained microbial populations that were completely different from those of plants growing in autoclaved soil. Moreover, bacterial and oomycete populations on the roots of non-diseased plants differed between non-transformed and Tetr tobacco, indicating that ethylene sensitivity affects microbial development in the root system. Analysis of spontaneously diseased Tetr plants growing in non-autoclaved soil demonstrated that the stems of young plants were primarily colonized by oomycetes, whereas stems of older plants were colonized mainly by fungi.   \\nVarious necrotrophic and biotrophic pathogens were tested on non-transformed and Tetr plants. In general, Tetr plants were more susceptible to necrotrophic bacteria, fungi, and oomycetes, that cause symptoms of necrosis and / or rotting, but not to biotrophic fungi, oomycetes and tobacco mosaic virus, which require living host tissues. Ethylene-insensitive Arabidopsis plants are likewise more susceptible to necrotrophic, but not to biotrophic pathogens. Both ethylene-insensitive tobacco and Arabidopsis displayed reduced activity of peroxidase, an enzyme often associated with disease resistance. Apparently, in tobacco and Arabidopsis ethylene insensitivity impairs the same kind of disease resistance mechanisms, resulting in enhanced susceptibility to a similar range of pathogens.\\nWe investigated whether resistance in Tetr plants can be restored by treatments that are known to protect plants against diseases.Treatments of Tetr tobacco with chemicals that induced expression of genes encoding pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins, did not reduce disease development. Overexpression of PR genes in the transgenic Tetr plants did not enhance resistance either. Also rhizobacteria that induce systemic resistance in tobacco and other plant species, or that directly antagonize pathogen growth, did not effectively protect Tetr plants. These results indicate that it is difficult to counteract the enhanced disease susceptibility of ethylene-insensitive Tetr tobacco plants. Apparently, ethylene signaling plays a central role in basal disease resistance against necrotrophic microorganisms.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['In a screen for light regulated transcription factors the ATB2 gene was identified. The ATB2 gene belongs to the S-basic domain/leucine zipper (bZIP) class. The spatial expression of ATB2 correlates with transport of metabolites from tissues that are metabolic active. Research has shown that high concentrations of sucrose repress GUS activity of promoter-GUS lines. This effect is sucrose specific, even glucose or fructose cannot mimic this effect. Regulation by sucrose is controlled post-transcriptionally because high concentrations of sucrose upregulate transcript levels while expression is repressed. To date ATB2 is the only gene discovered which is regulated at the post-transcriptional level by sucrose. Ectopic expression of a 5\\x92 UTR construct shows that the repression system is functional in all tissues of the shoot.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo identify mutants in the sucrose regulatory pathway, a non destructive screen, utilizing a dual reporter system, was devised. Both GUS and LUC reporter genes were used and are driven individually by ATB2 regulatory sequences. Repression of both GUS and LUC expression was tested when seedlings, containing the dual reporter system, were grown on solid medium. Lines which displayed sufficient expression and repression were identified and used for a EMS mutagenesis. Many putative mutants were identified but closer analysis revealed that mutants which displayed an altered regulatory phenotype for both of the reporter genes of the dual reporter system, were not among them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnalysis of the ATB2 sequences (genomic and cDNA) reveals an unusually long (383 bp) leader sequence. Literature studies have shown that long 5\\x92 sequences often contain regulatory elements. This is also the case for the ATB2 gene as deletion of the 5\\x92 UTR relieves the sucrose regulation. Closer examination of the 5\\x92UTR did not reveal any secondary structures but 4 uORFs were identified. The major uORF is 129 nt long and encodes a 42 aa protein. Arabidopsis contains two ATB2 homologs and both have the long leader sequence.\\r\\nA series of leader-deletion constructs have been made to locate the position of the sucrose regulating element. When the leader of the ATB2 gene is sequentially deleted the results show that the sucrose regulation is relieved when the major uORF is deleted (sucrose control uORF, SC-uORF). It seems that translation of the major uORF is important for the sucrose specific regulation. Only deletion of the startcodon of the major uORF relieves the regulation by sucrose. Deleting the startcodons from the other uORFs does not abolish the sucrose regulation. Closer analysis of the SC-uORF revealed a high amino acid conservation to other plant uORFs. These uORFs are located upstream of bZIP transcription factors. Remarkably,  these transcription factors all belong to the S-type bZIP transcription factor group.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Control of plant carbohydrate partitioning by the Arabidopsis thaliana ATB2 bZIP transcription factor gene'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['In this thesis the function of the ATB2 transcription factor in relation to carbohydrate partitioning was investigated. Transcription factors are targets of signal transduction cascades that serve to adapt transcriptional rates of specific downstream genes. Transcription factors do so by binding DNA in a sequence-specific manner. Such DNA elements are present in promoters of target genes which allows transcription factors to enhance or repress the activity of the general transcriptional apparatus. \\r\\nPlants express a plethora of different types of transcription factors which can be classified on the basis of overall sequence homology that likely reflects similar operational mechanisms. Completion of the Arabidopsis thaliana genome in 2000 allowed genome-wide comparison with other organisms. The Arabidopsis thaliana genome has a relatively high transcription factor content compared to organisms of other Kingdoms. ATB2 belongs to the group of bZIP transcription factors that is represented by 75 members which are involved in a broad variety of processes. Several aspects concerning the function of ATB2 and its signaling pathway have previously been presented. ATB2 expression is associated with the vasculature of sink tissues and is especially prominent in funiculi of fertilized ovules. Furthermore, ATB2 functions in a sucrose-signaling pathway. ATB2 expression is modulated by physiologically relevant concentrations of sucrose in a 5 untranslated region-dependent manner. Recently it was shown that ATB2 translation depends on the highly conserved sucrose-controlled upstream open reading frame. \\r\\nThe studies described in this thesis show that ATB2 serves a function in carbohydrate partitioning, the process of prolonged and directed allocation of sugars that results in a specific distribution of carbohydrates over all plant organs. In Chapter 2 an overexpression study of ATB2 in tobacco shows its detrimental effects on plant growth and development. Carbohydrate partitioning was severely affected presumably via a combinatorial effect of cell-wall invertases and sucrose transporter misexpression and altered activity. In Chapter 3 it is described that ATB2 overexpression causes similar growth impairments in Arabidopsis thaliana. ATB2 was shown to regulate a specific subset of Arabidopsis thaliana cell-wall invertases genes which could be partially responsible for the observed growth impairment. Furthermore, ATB2 was shown to regulate transcription of two close homologs, bZIP2 and bZIP44. The sucrose-specific translational regulation and expression pattern of bZIP2 and bZIP44 using transgenic promoter-GUS plants are described in Chapter 4. The expression patterns of both bZIP2 and bZIP44 are associated with the vasculature and with metabolically demanding tissues. Expression of both bZIP2 and bZIP44 can be repressed by sucrose in a 5 UTR-dependent manner. The overlapping expression patterns and sucrose-repression strengthen the idea of in vivo concerted action.\\r\\nIn conclusion, the data presented in this thesis support a model that explains the function of ATB2 in regulating sucrose supply to competing sinks in accordance to local sink demand. Furthermore, it appears that bZIP2 and bZIP44 could also play such a role as deduced from the similar and overlapping expression patterns. Also the presence of the sucrose-controlled upstream opern reading frame and the resulting translational dependency for sucrose suggests that all three bZIP transcription factors have similar roles in the control of carbohydrate partitioning.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Cell to cell signalling during vertebrate limb bud development'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Communication between cells is essential during embryonic development. The vertebrate limb bud provides us a model to study signalling interactions between cells during patterning of embryonic tissues and organogenesis. In chapter 1 I give an introduction about limb bud development that is focussed on the patterning of the anterior-posterior axis of the limb bud during outgrowth. Here I also introduce Sonic Hedgehog (SHH), which is a signalling molecule that is expressed by the cells of the polarising region. Shh mediates the organizing function of the polarising region and is required for patterning of the anterior-posterior axis of the distal limb. Mutual genetic antagonism between Gli3 and dHand prepatterns the limb prior to SHH signalling, resulting in the establishment of the polarizing region in posterior limb bud mesenchyme.\\r\\nIn chapter 2 I show that Gli3 and Alx4 genetically interact during limb and craniofacial development. Gli3 and Alx4 are both expressed in anterior limb bud mesenchyme and are required to keep the Shh expression domain posterior restricted. Disruption of either Gli3 or Alx4 results in the establishment of an ectopic Shh domain and preaxial polydactyly. However, analysis of limbs lacking both Gli3 and Alx4 reveal that these genes synergistically interact during patterning of all three groups of limb skeletal elements. In addition, skulls of embryos lacking both Gli3 and Alx4  exhibit craniofacial defects.\\r\\nChapter 3 I have established that limb bud mesenchymal cells response differentially to SHH signalling. During limb bud patterning SHH differentially activates secondary signalling molecules, like BMP2 and Gremlin. Here I show that SHH also acts upstream of NOTCH signalling during limb bud development. SHH regulates the expression of Jagged-1 and Hey, which are involved in NOTCH signal transduction, in the limb bud mesenchyme. Furthermore, I provide evidence that SHH acts upstream of Jagged-1 during patterning of the limb bud vascular system.\\r\\nThe SHH signal is relayed to the AER by BMP antagonist Gremlin. In chapter 4 I describe the Gremlin mutant limb phenotype, which corresponds to the limb deformity limb phenotype. Gremlin mutant limbs exhibit fusions of zeugopodal elements and digit syndactyly, indicating that anterior-posterior patterning is affected. I show that the absence of Gremlin mediated BMP antagonism disrupts the feedback loop between SHH and the AER. In Gremlin deficient limb buds activation of Fgfs and Bmps in the AER is disrupted and Shh expression is not propagated. Furthermore, mesenchymal limb buds cells undergo massive apoptosis in the absence of Gremlin.\\r\\nIn the final chapter I discuss whether SHH acts as a morphogen during limb bud patterning. It has been proven that SHH patterns the neural tube directly and not through induction of secondary signals. However it is still unclear whether SHH acts as a \"true\" morphogen during limb bud patterning. Furthermore, I discuss the role of NOTCH signalling during limb bud development. I propose future experiments that will allow us finding additional roles for NOTCH signalling during limb bud development.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['De vraagstelling en het geneeskundig kader waarin A.W.M. van Hasselt werkte worden gekenschetst in\\nHoofdstuk I. Er wordt ingegaan op begrippen als goed en kwaad vergif, physiologie en pharmacologie en hun\\nbetekenis in de negentiende eeuw. De toxicologie was in de tijd van Van Hasselt nog één ongedeeld vakgebied.\\nDe casuïstische kennis over vergiften werd in de negentiende eeuw geleidelijk aangevuld met gegevens uit\\nexperimenteel proefdieronderzoek. Deze experimentele toxiciteitsgegevens hadden nog geen vaste plaats in de\\nvakliteratuur. Het onderzoek met vergiften toegediend aan gezonde proefdieren werd opgenomen in\\npharmacologische handboeken, in toxicologische leerboeken en in boeken over de materia medica onder het hoofd\\nvan de physiologie. Het physiologisch effect vormde een aanwijzing voor de therapeutische werking binnen de dan\\nvigerende classificatiestelsels.\\nIn Hoofdstuk II wordt de West-Europese geschiedenis van de leer der vergiften beschreven tot aan de\\nEerste Wereldoorlog. De Grieken noemden vergiften N\"Dµ\"6\" (Latijn: pharmaca), zij wisten dat vergiften konden\\ndoden en aandoeningen konden genezen. Ziekten waren vergiftigingen, vergiften dienden te worden uitgedreven en\\nverstopte orgaanstelsels te worden geopend. De eenvoudigste methode was tegengesteld werkende vergiften in\\nstijgende doses toe te dienen totdat zij verschijnselen van een vergiftiging gaven (contraria contrariis). Aan de\\npogingen met vergiften het evenwicht in het lichaam te herstellen kon kennis over de therapeutische en dodelijke\\nhoeveelheden worden ontleend.\\nEind achttiende eeuw overheerste de kritiek op het gebruik van vergiften als geneesmiddel. Het\\nonderzoeken van goede (geneeskrachtige) en kwade (misdadige) vergiften zou met gebruik van proefdieren uitkomst\\nmoeten brengen. De casuïstische giftigheidsgegevens werden aangevuld met experimentele effectiviteits- en toxici-teitsgegevens.\\nIn de negentiende eeuw werd de inbreng van de analytische chemie in de leer van de goede en\\nkwade vergiften steeds belangrijker. In de experimenten met vergiften kon voor het eerst gewerkt worden met de\\ngeïsoleerde actieve stoffen; chemische analysetechnieken maakten het mogelijk een begin te maken met dynamisch\\nen kinetisch onderzoek van giftige stoffen in het lichaam van mens en proefdier. In deze ontwikkeling van de phar-macologie\\nen toxicologie hadden aanvankelijk de Franse en daarna de Duitse wetenschappers de leiding. De\\nNederlandse artsen volgden deze ontwikkeling op afstand.\\nIn Hoofdstuk III wordt de historische ontwikkeling van de toxicologie in Nederland beschreven. In de\\nachttiende eeuw werd er in Nederland veel geschreven over de loodvergiftiging. Gevallen van loodkoliek traden niet\\nalleen op bij de beroepsmatig blootgestelden, maar ook bij burgers, die onbewust lood opnamen met drinkwater, wijn\\nen andere dranken. Loodvergiftigingen traden ook op bij patiënten die behandeld werden met loodverbindingen als\\ngoede vergiften. De casuïstiek van de loodvergiftiging bleef in de negentiende en twintigste eeuw de aandacht\\nvragen van artsen en van apothekers en scheikundigen die de loodbepalingen uitvoerden.\\nIn Hoofdstuk IV wordt een beeld geschetst van Van Hasselt, zijn familie en gezin en van zijn loopbaan in\\nde militaire geneeskundige dienst en in wetenschappelijke kringen.\\nIn Hoofdstuk V komt Van Hasselts geneeskundig werk aan de orde. Van drie onderwerpen, de\\nmaagpomp, de tabaksrookklisteer en de kunstmatige ademhaling, behandelde hij de geschiedenis en de resultaten\\nvan zijn proeven. De maagpomp werd in Nederland dan nog niet toegepast, maar Van Hasselt achtte het instrument\\nonmisbaar voor het redden van het leven van alcoholvergiftigden.\\nDe tabaksrookklisteer was een empirische behandeling uit een vitalistisch verleden en de nieuwe methodes\\nvoor herstel van de ademhaling en de bloedcirculatie berusten op natuurwetenschappelijk denken en physiologisch\\nonderzoek. De kunstmatige ademhaling is een alternatief voor de tabaksrookklisteer. Het naast elkaar bestaan van\\ndeze methodes voor de behandeling van schijndoden is illustratief voor het tijdvak. Van Hasselt maakte geen keuze\\ntussen de oude en nieuwe behandelingsmethodes van schijndoden: het herstellen van de ademhaling had de priori-teit,\\nde methode waarop dit werd behaald, was van minder belang. Van Hasselt bedacht een nieuwe handmatige\\nmethode voor de kunstmatige ademhaling, die tot diep in de twintigste eeuw nog in de Oranje-Kruisboekjes is\\nopgenomen.\\nIn 1856 verscheen de eerste druk van Van Hasselts \\x93Handleiding tot de leer van het militair geneeskundig\\nonderzoek, het visiteren der manschappen bij hunne intrede in en hunne verwijdering uit de dienst in verband met de\\nziekten en gebreken die voorgewend, nagebootst, willekeurig voortgebragt of voorbedachtelijk verborgen kunnen\\nworden\\x94. Het ging om het opsporen van simulanten en dissimulanten, van wetsovertreders die om uiteenlopende\\nredenen aan de dienstplicht of aan afkeuring wilden ontsnappen.\\nIn Hoofdstuk VI worden de activiteiten van Van Hasselt op het gebied van de toxicologie beschreven. Hij\\nheeft voor zijn toxicologische geschriften hoofdzakelijk geput uit werken van buitenlanders. De leraren van de Rijks\\nKweekschool kregen omtrent 1850 het verzoek om ten behoeve van het onderwijs over hun vakken handleidingen te\\nschrijven. Van Hasselt was als een van de eersten begonnen met zijn Handleiding der Vergiftleer. Reeds in 1848 had\\nVan Hasselt een groot werk gepubliceerd, gebaseerd op een lezing voor het Natuurkundig Gezelschap te Utrecht. De\\ntitel van dit werk luidde: \\x93De noodzakelijkheid van algemeen toezigt op het gebruik van vergiften\\x94. Van Hasselt maakt\\nhierin een origineel onderscheid in zes categorieën van vergiften:\\n- Vergiftiging door toeval, uit onkunde, roekeloosheid, snoeplust en onvoorzichtigheid?171\\n- Vergiftigingen ontstaan uit winzucht en gebrek\\n- ergiftigingen door geneeskrachtige zelfstandigheden\\n- Vergiftigingen door ambachten, bedrijven en beroepen\\n- Zelfvergiftiging\\n- Vergiftmoord\\nIn zijn Handleiding der Vergiftleer volgt hij een indeling in natuurrijken: het mineralen-, planten- en dierenrijk.\\nDe eigenschappen van een vergift werden door Van Hasselt zeer systematisch behandeld, waarbij hij fysische en\\nchemische kenmerken, verschijnselen bij acute en chronische vergiftigingen en de behandeling aan de orde stelde,\\nzowel uit een oogpunt van forensische toxicologie als van medische politie.\\nIn gevallen dat de literatuur te tegenstrijdige resultaten opleverde heeft hij met behulp van zijn vierdejaars\\nkwekelingen eenvoudige proeven met konijnen uitgevoerd. Hij wenste zijn toxicologische werkruimte aan de RKMG\\nuit te breiden, maar het parlement schrapte deze post bij de bespreking van de begroting van 1867. De opneming van\\nde RKMG in het Amsterdams Athenaeum Illustre werd toen al voorbereid. Zijn toxicologisch onderzoek naar\\npijlvergiften liet Van Hasselt in 1869 verrichten in het Physiologisch Laboratorium, dat onder leiding stond van de\\nhoogleraar W. Kühne, leerling van Dubois-Reymond en Claude Bernard.\\nAlhoewel Van Hasselt het vak leer der vergiften aan de RKMG slechts van 1842 tot 1858 heeft ingevuld, is\\nde toxicologie tot op hoge leeftijd zijn grote liefde gebleven. Hij heeft docerend en publicerend het vak moeten leren in\\neen periode dat het zich ontwikkelde van een casuïstisch tot een physiologisch leervak, van een empirische tot een\\nexperimentele wetenschap.\\nDe vraag naar de betekenis van Van Hasselt voor de ontwikkeling van de toxicologie in Nederland is niet\\neenvoudig te beantwoorden. Zijn kwaliteiten en prestaties als docent en auteur bieden een tegenwicht aan zijn\\nkleinschalig wetenschappelijk onderzoek op dit vakgebied. Van Hasselt heeft door zijn goed gestructureerde\\nhandleidingen en zijn vele andere publicaties een belangrijke bijdrage geleverd aan de opleiding en\\nberoepsuitoefening van militaire en civiele geneeskundigen. Door zijn vele bestuurlijke functies heeft hij een\\nvoortrekkersrol vervuld bij de behandeling van vraagstukken met betrekking tot de openbare gezondheid. In een\\n\\x91tweede carrière\\x92 heeft hij zijn stempel gedrukt op de araneologie.\\nBijlage 1 geeft een overzicht over de publicaties en activiteiten van Van Hasselt; Bijlage 2 beschrijft\\nVan Hasselts verdiensten in de araneologie en in Bijlage 3 wordt een korte uiteenzetting gegeven over de\\nbiosynthesewegen van de besproken plantaardige vergiften.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['This thesis deals with the influence of fat feeding on lipid metabolism in horses. Highfat diets have attained considerable interest as a potential tool to improve performance.Many factors affect performance so that large numbers of horses are needed to unequivocally determine the effect of diet on performance. In practice, the execution of trials on diet in relation to performance is not possible. However, based on the reported effects of nutrition on metabolism, it should be possible to predict the effect of nutrition on performance. The aim of the studies described in this thesis was to demonstrate a rationale, or a lack of it, for feeding horses on diets with extra fat.\\nLiterature data show that, analogously to training, the contribution of fatty acids to the energy supply during exercise is increased on a fat-rich diet. The fat-induced changes in the metabolic machinery might lead to a sparing of glucose and glycogen during an aerobic workload and to the promoting of glycolysis during anaerobic exercise. Attention was focussed on investigating the effect of dietary fat supplementation on equine lipid metabolism in untrained horses in the fasting state.\\nThis thesis shows that feeding a fat-rich diet triggers metabolic adaptations on the cellular level which are comparable to those described as induced by training. Thus, feeding a high-fat diet might be advantagous to exercising horses.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['This thesis aims towards a better understanding of the mechanisms that lead to chemical-induced adverse immune effects. We focussed thereby on the initial induction stage of the immune reaction that consists of three major steps: (i) formation of neoantigen, (ii) processing and presentation of the neoantigen, and (iii) recognition of peptide-MHC-complex by the T cell.\\nChemical induced allergy or autoimmunity is often observed after administration of certain drugs or after contact with industrial or environmental chemicals. T cells play a central role in the development of drug-induced adverse immune reactions. A major difficulty in studying T-cell reactions to sensitizing chemicals is the fact that in most cases the ultimate neoantigen recognized by \"drug-specific\" T cells is unknown. As most T cells can only recognize peptides on MHC molecules, chemicals have to bind to a protein carrier in order to be recognized by T cells. Parts of this neoantigen are presented on MHC molecules on the surface of the APC and can be engaged by T cells. In order to bind to proteins, most chemicals have to be metabolized into protein-reactive intermediates, called haptens. Although the liver is the main organ for metabolic transformation, it does not play a major role in the induction of chemical induced adverse immune effects. In contrast, cells from the immune system itself, like neutrophils and monocytes have been shown to be involved in drug-metabolism prior to drug-induced adverse immune effects. In this thesis we have tried to elucidate some of the mechanisms involved in chemical induced adverse immune effects. Some of the steps possibly involved in the formation of neoantigens and subsequent T cell recognition are discussed. The hypothesis that extrahepatic metabolism plays an important role in the formation of neoantigen with the prohaptens procainamide and aniline could be substantiated, and the processing of protein adducts, presentation of neoantigens and subsequent recognition of either haptenated peptides or cryptic peptides by T cells was shown. Furthermore, this thesis elucidates some of the mechanisms involved in cross-sensitization and discusses the possible implications of T-cell cross-reactivity in chemical induced allergy and autoimmunity.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Surface activity of pulmonary surfactant protein B : from biophysical properties to clinical application'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['The global aim of our studies was to obtain more information about the mechanisms involved in the action of the hydrophobic surfactant components, with a special attention for SP-B. To reach this goal, many different assays and devices were used, including a pressure driven captive bubble surfactometer (CBS), a spreading trough and an atomic force microscope. The thesis starts with a general overview about the function and structural variation of the surfactant proteins (chapter 1). It is described that the activity and structure of the hydrophobic surfactant proteins SP-B and SP-C is very conserved among species throughout evolution, while more variation exists for that of SP-A and SP-D.\\nAim i) of the thesis research was to obtain knowledge about the effect of SP-B and SP-C on the surface activity of spread films. This study, described in chapter 2, was done using the CBS, an apparatus that allows accurate determination of surface tension under dynamic conditions [24,25,26]. Surfactant components were spread at the air/liquid interface of an air-bubble, which was subsequently repeatedly compressed and expanded, thereby mimicking the breathing cycle. In this way information can be obtained on the role of individual surfactant components. Both SP-B and SP-C activity depended on the concentration of the proteins. Differences in surface dynamics between both proteins were found when lipid vesicles were omitted from the subphase.\\nAim ii) was to investigate the role of cholesterol in surfactant. The effect of cholesterol on surface tension was examined by CBS, using spread lipid films containing SP-B and/or SP-C (chapter 3). It was shown that a cholesterol content of 10 mol% is optimal for surfactant activity in films containing SP-B, but not in films containing both SP-B and SP-C, or SP-C alone. Furthermore, differences in network structures were seen between films containing and those lacking cholesterol, as visualized by AFM.\\nAim iii) was to investigate which surfactant components are responsible for the formation of protrusions upon monolayer compression towards low surface tensions (described in chapter 4). The appearance of compressed films containing saturated phospholipids plus native bovine SP-B was visualized by AFM. These films had similar appearance as those containing synthetic peptides based on the 25 N-terminal amino acids of SP-B. Protrusion height of lipid films containing SP-B1-25 peptide, however, was lower than that found for films containing native SP-B. It was further shown that the number of protruded layers depends on whether the phospholipids contain an unsaturated fatty acyl chain, and on whether the unsaturated acyl chain is present in phosphatidylcholine or in phosphatidylglycerol.\\nAim iv) was to label a surfactant component and determine its distribution in a model of ARDS. In chapter 5 a method to label SP-B covalently at specific sites with the fluorophore Bodipy FL CASE is described. Using an array of techniques, fluorescently labeled SP-B was characterized and subsequently compared to the native protein. For instance, in a glass spreading trough mimicking dichotomic lung anatomy labeled SP-B spread on top of an aqueous surface and lowered surface tension independent of trough geometry. Since Bodipylabeled SP-B was shown to have retained its biophysical activity, it was supplemented to bovine lung surfactant extract and this was administered to rats in a model of ARDS (chapter 6). In this way the distribution of exogenous surfactant during surfactant replacement therapy was determined at the alveolar level. It was found that the majority of administered surfactant reached underinflated (dystelectatic) as well as aerated (open) alveoli, but hardly spread into severely damaged and collapsed (atelectatic) alveoli. The thesis is concluded with a summarizing discussion.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Protective immunity against influenza in pigs'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Swine influenza is a highly contagious acute viral disease of the respiratory tract in pigs, which is prevalent world-wide. The disease causes considerable economic damage primarily due to reduced weight gain in finishing pigs and reduced reproductive performance of sows. In addition, influenza is a zoonotic disease, because swine influenza viruses can transmit to, and cause disease in people, and pigs can be a source of new human influenza strains. Moreover, antigenic drift of the swine influenza A H3N2 viruses in the Netherlands and Belgium was demonstrated and a replacement of this strain by a more recent swine H3N2 virus in swine vaccines has been recommended. In this thesis, research is described in which the protection conferred by current swine influenza vaccines was evaluated and possible improvements to influenza vaccines were studied.\\r\\nA current commercial split virus in oil adjuvant vaccine was shown to be efficacious in protecting pigs against a drift variant of H3N2 in a vaccination-challenge experiment. Therefore, there does not yet seem to be an urgent need for the virus strains to be replaced by more recent strains. The swine vaccine may confer a broader protection than human sub-unit vaccines possibly because of the presence of the other viral proteins in addition to the HA and NA, and of the adjuvant. Because the variability of the HA and NA are a major problem in vaccinating pigs and humans against influenza, immune responses to other more conserved proteins were studied. Antibodies to the highly conserved extracellular domain of M2 and cytotoxic T cells (CTL) to the NP seemed to be involved in broad-spectrum protection in pigs after infection, but are not induced by current vaccines. However, an experimental vaccine that induced those effectors, and no antibodies to the HA and NA, enhanced instead of prevented clinical signs after viral challenge. This indicates that those effectors can even exacerbate disease, when induced parenterally and/or if other effectors are absent. Therefore, although including conserved antigens in vaccines and enhancing the response against them could broaden protection, caution must be exercised to make sure they do not enhance disease after vaccination with novel generations of vaccines. Successive intranasal vaccination with an attenuated H1N1 strain and an H3N2 strain will specifically induce mucosal subtype cross-reactive IgA and IgG antibodies, as well as CTL. Although such drastic vaccination strategies are not applicable to pigs they might be applied as a strategy of immunisation in case a next human pandemic is feared. A broad-spectrum vaccine, which can be applied intramuscular would be ideal but as long as such a vaccine cannot be developed, extensive influenza surveillance and regular updating of vaccine strains will remain necessary.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Streptococcus suis infections in pigs : use of virulence-associated markers in diagnostics and vaccines'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Streptococcus suis is an important pig pathogen which is mainly associated with meningitis, arthritis and septicaemia. Control of the disease is hampered by the lack of effective vaccines and the lack of reliable diagnostic tests with high specificity and sensitivity. The development of these tools is complicated by the number of existing serotypes, by the fact that we still lack knowledge of the factors responsible for virulence and protection, and by the fact that strains may vary in virulence. Therefore, research focused on the identification of virulence-associated markers that discriminate between virulent and less virulent or avirulent isolates, has gained considerable interest in recent years. The aim of the investigations described in this thesis, was to test whether these virulence-associated markers could be used in diagnostic assays for the detection of S. suis infections and/or for use in vaccines to protect against the disease.\\nIn previous work, muramidase-released protein (MRP) and extracellular-factor protein EF were identified as markers of virulence in serotype 1 and 2 strains. In other serotypes the production of MRP and EF, and their potential importance for bacterial virulence has not been investigated. Therefore, we determined the serotypes as well as MRP and EF phenotypes for a collection of S. suis strains isolated from diseased pigs in seven European countries. Overall, S. suis serotype 2 appeared to be most prevalent (32%), followed by serotype 9 (20%) and serotype 1 (12%). EF-positive strains, were found in serotype 1 (66%), 2 (71%) and 14 (85%) strains. Variants of MRP (MRP* or MRPs) were found in nearly all serotypes. A high percentage (81%) of the serotype 9 strains belonged to the MRP*EF- phenotype.\\nFor the detection of pigs carrying virulent serotype 2 strains, serotype 1, 1/2, 7, 9 and 14 strains, Multiplex PCR tests have been developed. In Multiplex PCR 1, three DNA targets, based on the S. suis serotype 1 (and 14), 7 and 9 specific capsular polysaccharide (cps) genes, were amplified. In Multiplex PCR II, two other targets, based on the serotype 2 (and 1/2) specific cps gene and the epf gene encoding the EF-protein, were amplified. The evaluation of these PCRs for use on tonsillar specimens of diseased pigs demonstrated that the assays were highly specific and sensitive. \\nFor the development of protective vaccines, the efficacy of a MRP and EF vaccine applied in pigs was tested. Pigs were vaccinated twice and challenged intravenously with virulent S. suis serotype 2 strains. At challenge, pigs vaccinated with MRP and EF were protected against infection and disease. Pigs vaccinated with either MRP or EF were less well protected. Apparently the combination of both proteins is necessary to obtain full protection.\\nThe protective efficacy of an avirulent, non-encapsulated isogenic mutant of S. suis serotype 2 was determined in pigs, and compared with the efficacy of the capsulated wild-type strain. Vaccinations were with formalin-killed cells of the wild-type (WT-BAC), formalin-killed cells of the non-encapsulated mutant (CM-BAC) or with the live non-encapsulated mutant (CM-LIVE) strain. Pigs were challenged intravenously with the homologous, wild-type S. suis serotype 2 strain. The results demonstrated that, as expected, the formalin-killed cells of WT-BAC induced complete protection in pigs against mortality and morbidity after challenge. The formalin-killed cells of CM-BAC induced complete protection against mortality, but only partial protection against morbidity. The CM-LIVE vaccine induced only partial protection, both against mortality and morbidity. These findings indicate that CPS and other bacterial components of WT-BAC are probably essential for full protection against homologous challenge.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Bovine Herpesvirus 4 infections and bovine mastitis'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Mastitis is an often occurring disease in dairy cattle with an enormous economic impact for milk producers worldwide. Despite intensive research, which is historically based on the detection of bacterial udder pathogens, still around 20-35% of clinical cases of bovine mastitis have an unknown aetiology. Due to the high number of unknown causes of clinical mastitis, studies were undertaken to gain more insight into the role of viruses in this important disease. For the first time, we found that BHV4 may be involved in the aetiology of bovine mastitis, because it was isolated from milk of 3 (5%) out of 58 cows with clinical mastitis and not from the 58 matched control cows. Concomitant with the isolation of BHV4, an increase in antibody titre against BHV4 was noted in two of these three mastitis cows from which BHV4 was isolated. The use of the bovine umbilical cord endothelial cells, a cell type seldom used in bovine virology, proved to be a good choice. Susceptibility studies showed that BHV4 grew to much higher titres in bovine umbilical cord endothelial cells than in the routinely used Madin Darby bovine kidney cells. The bovine umbilical cord endothelial cell type was not only highly susceptible to BHV4, but it also proved to be susceptible to other bovine herpesviruses, such as BHV2 and BHV5. \\nFor the detection of BHV4 antibodies only one commercial indirect-ELISA was available. We developed and evaluated an immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA) for the detection of antibodies directed against BHV4. After validation, the IPMA proved to be a reliable test, and it was found more sensitive for the early detection of BHV4 antibodies than the indirect-ELISA. In addition, a serological survey showed that the estimated seroprevalence of BHV4 in Dutch cattle was 16-18% and that the percentage of BHV4 seropositive cattle varied by age category between 6 and 43%.\\nA polymerase chain reaction for the detection of BHV4-glycoprotein-B (gB) DNA was developed and validated, and a nested-PCR was modified to detect BHV4-thymidine kinase (TK) DNA in bovine milk samples. Both methods proved to be rapid and reliable tests for the screening of BHV4 DNA in milk. In a second case-control study, using these newly developed diagnostic tools, BHV4 and BHV4-gB DNA was detected in milk from 2 (4%) out of 54 cows with clinical mastitis, whereas no BHV4 was detected by virus isolation and PCR in 54 matched controls. An experimental study was performed to examine whether a simultaneous intramammary and intranasal inoculation of lactating cows with BHV4 induced clinical mastitis. No clinical mastitis was noted in the four inoculated lactating cows, but the somatic cell counts increased significantly in milk of 50% of the BHV4 inoculated quarters, compared to the non-inoculated quarters of the same cows and quarters of mock-inoculated cows (control group) on days 8, 9, and 11 post-inoculation. Another interesting finding was that a bacterial infection, Streptococcus uberis infection, triggered BHV4 replication. \\nBased on the studies performed, we conclude that BHV4 may play a role in the aetiology of bovine mastitis, albeit likely a minor one in clinical mastitis. Studies suggest rather a role in subclinical mastitis and an indirect role for BHV4 in the aetiology of bovine mastitis. More research is warranted to investigate its indirect role as a result of e.g. immunosuppression. \\n\\nIn a review study, the role of viruses in the aetiology of bovine mastitis has been noted. Bovine herpesvirus 1, bovine herpesvirus 4, foot-and-mouth disease virus, and parainfluenza 3 virus have been isolated from milk from cows with clinical mastitis. Intramammary inoculations of bovine herpesvirus 1 or parainfluenza 3 virus induced clinical mastitis, while an intramammary inoculation of foot-and-mouth disease virus resulted in necrosis of the mammary gland. Subclinical mastitis has been induced after a simultaneous intramammary and intranasal inoculation of lactating cows with bovine herpesvirus 4. Bovine leukaemia virus has been detected in mammary tissue of cows with subclinical mastitis, but whether this virus was able to induce bovine mastitis has not been reported. \\nBovine herpesvirus 2, vaccinia, cowpox, pseudocowpox, vesicular stomatitis, foot-and-mouth disease viruses, and bovine papillomaviruses can play an indirect role in the aetiology of bovine mastitis. These viruses can induce teat lesions, for instance in the ductus papillaris, which result in a reduction of the natural defence mechanisms of the udder and indirectly in bovine mastitis due to bacterial pathogens. Bovine herpesvirus 1, bovine viral diarrhoea virus, bovine immunodeficiency virus, and bovine leukaemia virus infections may play an indirect role in bovine mastitis, due to their immunosuppressive properties. \\n\\nFinally, based on the studies performed during this thesis and the review study on viral infections and bovine mastitis, we may conclude that viruses can play a direct or indirect role in the aetiology of bovine mastitis.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Transgenic animals play an important role in biomedical research. Their use as animal model is still increasing. Although the process of transgenesis may contribute to refinement of animal use, the application of the biotechnological procedures that are involved in the production of transgenic animals may also cause unexpected, uncontrolled, and even undetected animal suffering. Therefore, the aim of the present thesis was to study the effects of the biotechnological procedures involved in genetic modification on the welfare of the resulting offspring. The two most frequently used techniques for inserting new genetic material into the mammalian germ line, pronuclear microinjection and embryonic stem (ES) cell-mediated gene transfer, have been studied. Different groups of mice were generated, each of which had undergone different aspects of the microinjection technique (Chapters 2 and 3) or of the gene targeting technique (Chapters 4 and 5), in order to determine whether the specific manipulations have any effect on the development or behaviour of the progeny. In this way, the effects of microinjection, electroporation, embryo-culture or embryo transplantation on the development of (chimeric) mice could be studied separately. All mice of the different groups were tested in their pre-weaning (0-3 weeks of age) and post-weaning period (4-30 weeks of age) for behavioural and morphological/physiological development and for clinical appearance. Thereafter, post-mortem examinations were performed. In addition, the feasibility of the use of score sheets for monitoring the welfare of transgenic mice, as part of the daily care of animals, has been explored (Chapter 6).  With both techniques, the biotechnological procedures increased (perinatal) pup mortality and body weight. In addition, with the gene targeting technique, 8% of the chimeric animals was hermaphrodite. The results so far indicate that, under the present conditions, the biotechnological procedures (microinjection; in vitro culture; embryo transfer) mainly affect the viability of the embryos and seem to have no major effects on the development and behaviour of mice that survive the first 2-3 days after birth. However, before drawing general conclusions, more and different transgenic lines should be studied in a comparable way. A scoring system has been developed, containing a limited number of sensitive, easy to determine and non-invasive parameters, selected from our previous studies on implications of transgenesis for the well-being of mice. The feasibility of this scoring system has been tested, to assess the use of score sheets for monitoring the welfare of transgenic mice on a practical basis, as part of the animal technicians  daily routine in a transgenic unit. It has been found to be both practical and useful. Therefore, in the production of transgenic animals, the use of score sheets is recommended, in order to detect both the intended and the non-intended (side) effects of the introduced or mutated gene at an early stage of development.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['The various faces of copper in laboratory animals'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['All research described in this thesis focuses on the role of copper in various biochemical processes. It appears that copper has various faces in laboratory animals. On the one hand, copper is an essential trace element, which implicates that a certain requirement for copper exists. On the other hand, copper may be involved in the formation of free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS), causing the development of oxidative stress. Oxidative stress has been associated with reduced lifespan and various diseases as a consequence of oxidative damage at the (sub)cellular level. Copper may not only affect biochemical processes in laboratory animals, it may also be affected itself by endogenous and exogenous factors, such as dietary cholesterol. Furthermore, strain differences in hepatic copper content and hepatic copper concentration have been found, which can be (partly) explained by genetic differences. All studies described in this thesis, except the review in chapter 3, were performed in laboratory animals keeping the 3 R\\x92s of laboratory animal science (reduction, refinement and replacement) in mind. Some of the studies performed are for the benefit of the animal (chapter 2), in some studies the animal is used as a model (chapter 6-10) and in some studies, the animal was used as a model, but the results of the study could be used for the benefit of the animal (chapter 4 and 5). In case the animal was used as a model, the purpose of the experiment was to study mechanisms in vivo rather than in vitro.\\nThe overall conclusions are : (I.) Copper is an essential trace element, implicating that a certain copper requirement exists to compensate for endogenous losses. The dietary copper allowance for the NMRI outbred laboratory mouse, as determined in the study described in chapter 2, is 4 ppm Cu, which is lower than the NRC\\x92s estimated allowance of 6 ppm Cu for maintenance and 8 ppm for growing and lactating mice, but in line with results described by other authors. The difference in dietary copper allowance probably stems from the fact that the recommendation of the NRC is based on rats and on four studies in mice, of which three were not designed to study copper requirement. We feel that this study contributes to a soundly based estimated copper allowance for mice. (II.) Evidence for the involvement of copper in the formation of free radicals and ROS comes mainly from in vitro research (chapter 3). No evidence was found for copper-mediated oxidative damage at the (sub)cellular level (chapter 4) nor a reduced lifespan was found (chapter 5) in mice fed diets with increasing copper concentrations. These results raise serious questions about the likelihood of developing oxidative stress in other rodents or in human in vivo after high copper intakes. (III.) In literature, dietary cholesterol has been associated with reduced liver copper concentrations and/or liver copper content. Feeding a cholesterol-rich diet to rats did not affect the liver copper content. In rabbits, a decrease in the hepatic copper store was found only in the dietary cholesterol-susceptible inbred strain. The idea that cholesterol-susceptible animals will show a greater decrease in hepatic copper content after being fed a cholesterolrich diet thus could not be consistently confirmed. In both rabbits and rats a decrease in liver copper concentration was found, but the decrease in rats was probably due to diet-induced hepatomegaly. The reduced liver copper concentrations in rats fed a cholesterol-rich diet as described in literature may also be the result of dietary-induced hepatomegaly. (IV.) Strain differences in liver copper store and liver copper concentrations can (partly) be explained by genetic differences between the strains. QTL analysis can be helpful in identifying genes that are involved in such quantitative traits. Some of the QTLs found in rats may give a clue as to what genes are involved in copper regulation. In the rabbit, however, more research on the structure of the genome is needed before candidate genes for QTLs can be identified.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Equine locomotory muscles : postnatal development and the influence of exercise'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['The Dutch warmblood horse is widely used in different types of sport. The individual capacity to perform depends on factors as character and the quality of the cardiopulmonary and musculoskeletal system. These factors are partly genetically determined; in the postnatal phase of growth and maturation they develop via a natural pattern, influenced by environmental factors. This way, the capacity to perform can be affected by training and exercise. Many studies about the influence on functional muscle properties like power and resistance against fatigue have been executed with humans and (young) adult horses. These studies have proven the positive effects of training and exercise many times. The question remains if further benefit can be achieved when young foals are submitted to training already in their first year of life. It can be expected that in the early postnatal period, when muscles adapt to the new environment, the sensitivity of muscles for training is high. If improvement occurs, the capacity for later athletic performance might be affected as better possibilities are created for further adaptation during the conventional training period later in life.\\nIn this thesis, a group of 38 Dutch warmblood horses from the EXOC (EXamination OsteoChondrosis) project (1996) is described. It was an unique opportunity to examine such a large group of horses. The group was divided in 3 groups in the first week of life. The first group was the Boxrest group. The animals from this group were permanently kept in the stable with their mares. The second group was the Boxtraining group. The animals from this group were also kept in the stable but underwent forced movement (gallop sprints) every day. The third group was the Pasture group. These animals moved freely in the pasture. At 22 weeks of age, half the foals were euthanised for other purposes of the EXOC project. The other half was kept in a paddock, as one group, with the possibility of some free movement.\\nAt several ages between 0 and 48 weeks, biopsies were taken from two important locomotory muscles (gluteus medius and semitendinosus). In these biopsies indicators for muscle power and contraction speed and resistance against fatigue (expressed in blood perfusion parameters and oxidative enzyme activities) were analysed. Measurements were done with the aid of modern techniques such as the usage of monoclonal antibodies and computer imaging systems.\\nThe studies in this thesis are the first to describe the occurrence of 2 uncommon muscle contractile proteins in locomotory muscles of newborn horses. These proteins are normally present in heart muscle and in the recovering skeletal muscles after traumata. Furthermore, it appeared that functional muscle properties underwent major changes in the first year of life. Dutch warmblood horses are born as \\x91sprinters\\x92 and develop towards more \\x91endurance-like\\x92 athletes. The resistance against fatigue is high at birth, decreases until 22 weeks of age and then becomes stable. It appeared when foals are restricted in movement (Boxrest group), the blood perfusion and the capacity of muscles to produce energy efficiently remains underdeveloped. Movement (forced or freely) is necessary for normal growth and maturation of the locomotory muscles. Further benefit from forced movement (Boxtraining group) above free movement in the pasture (Pasture group) was not demonstrated. For this reason, it is recommended to leave young foals in the pasture as much as possible.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Dietary control of equine plasma triacylglycerols'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['The study of this thesis concerns the dietary influence on lipid metabolism in horses. The main issue is the effect of dietary medium chain triacylglycerols (MCT) on triacylglycerol metabolism.\\nIn certain conditions high-fat diets can be beneficial for horses. Diets rich in long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids in the form of soybean oil decrease plasma triacylglycerol concentrations and increase the activity of heparin-released lipoprotein lipase activity in horses. The metabolic adaptation to fat supplementation in the horse appears to proceed in a manner similar to that seen in response to training. \\nThe feeding of MCT versus soybean oil raised the plasma level of triacylglycerols in horses. There was no significant effect of carbohydrate source and no fat-carbohydrate interaction. However, when diets contained soybean oil, cellulose versus glucose produced significantly greater increase in plasma triacylglycerols. A major product of cellulose fermentation is acetic acid. In the liver acetic acid can be converted into Acetyl-CoA in the cytosol and be use for in de novo fatty acid synthesis. But when horses are fed isoenergetic amounts of MCT or cellulose, cellulose did not increase the triacylglycerol concentrations in plasma.\\nFeeding of MCT instead of soybean oil would increase the production of plasma triacylglycerols together with an increase in the clearance rate of triacylglycerols. The rate of triacylglycerol clearance was on average about two-fold higher than the calculated rate of triacylglycerol production. The LPL activity was lower when the ponies were fed MCT. It was concluded that MCT versus soybean oil causes an increase in the triacylglycerol production, leading to an elevation of plasma triacylglycerol concentration and eliciting an increase in plasma triacylglycerol clearance as a secondary feature.\\nWhen horses were fed high-fat rations with either soybean oil or palm oil, there was no difference in plasma triacylglycerol levels between the two diets. Thus, dietary soybean oil probably did not affect the hepatic secretion of very-low-density-lipoproteins with triacylglycerols. Apparently, plasma triacylglycerol concentrations in horses are not sensitive to the degree of saturation of dietary fatty acids.\\nIn a cross-over study with 6 adult horses, the effect of isoenergetic replacement of dietary glucose by beetpulp on the concentration of plasma triacylglycerol was studied. The test ration contained 25% beetpulp, with 5% pectine in the dietary dry matter. The feeding of beetpulp lowered the plasma concentration of triacylglycerol in fasting state and raised the activity of heparin-released LPL. It is suggested that beetpulp ingestion activates lipoprotein lipase followed by a drop in plasma triacylglycerols.\\nHyperlipaemia is a condition in ponies associated with a dysfunction in lipidmetabolism. A fat-free liquid diet was formulated for the treatment of hyperlipaemia. As sole source of nutrition the liquid diet fully counteracted fasting-induced hyperlipaemia in two healthy ponies. The liquid diet has potential in the treatment of hyperlipaemia -it provides energy and nutrients to counteract the negative energy balance and low nutritional status of patients.\\nThis thesis shows that MCT-rich rations increase the plasma level of triacylglycerols in horses by increasing de novo fatty acid synthesis in the liver. The effect on triacylglycerol metabolism is different than when diets rich in soybean oil are fed to horses and indicates that MCT is not suitable for performance horses. Another result from this thesis is that the intake of beetpulp has similar effects on lipid metabolism than soybean oil.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The cervix uteri is a rigid tube which connects the uterus with the vagina and during most of the time it is firmly closed. During oestrus, late  pregnancy and parturition, the morphological appearance in the cervix changes markedly, resulting in a softer cervix, which during parturition can even be stretched open to a diameter that is more than a tenfold larger than before.\\r\\nDuring gyneacological interventions, such as artificial inseminations in several animal species, or in women it would be beneficial to penetrate the cervix with ease. Clinical obsterical problems occur when insufficient closure of the cervix during pregnancy causes premature birth, or when the cervix fails to dilate during birth. Collagen is one of the most important components of the cervix that causes the rigidness of the cervix and during softening of the cervix, collagen has been shown to undergo significant changes in its structure. Several hormones are involved in regulating these changes, by stimulating or depressing processes that are mostly associated with the inflammation cascade. \\r\\nSo far studies that aimed to get more insight into the many factors involved in cervical softening have been using cross-sectional study protocols. Ethical and practical considerations in the subjects that are mostly used (women, small laboratory animals or small ruminants) make it almost impossible to perform longitudinal studies in these species. Another limiting factor in these type of studies is the fact that functional changes in the cervix are usually related to the gestational age, rather than the stage of gestation, relative to parturition. The hormonal changes in the maternal blood and the changes that take place in the cervix during parturition are more dramatic compared towhat happens during late pregnancy or the oestous phase of the cycle. It is therefore, logic to assume that during parturition functional changes in the cervix are differently regulated than during the other two stages, that they may differ in several biochemical and cellular aspects, and that timing of these changes relative to the moment of birth is critical. \\r\\nWith the studies described in this thesis we aimed to find out if the cow could be a more suitable model for longitudinal studies of the cervix. By using a newly described biopsy technique to study samples that were repeatedly obtained from cows during different stages of gestation we were able to differentiate the biochemical changes that occur in the collagen of the bovine cervix during cervical ripening and during parturition. By adapting an ultrasound cervimetry technique, previously used in women, combining it with frequent blood-sampling and electromyographic (EMG) measurements of the uterus, we  were able to continuosly monitor cervical dilatation during parturition and relate this to temporal changes in hormone levels and myometrial activity. In addition, studies of the cervix of the non-pregnant cow have shown that regional differences exist in biochemical aspects of collagen and expression of oestrogen and progesterone receptors, indicating that it is critical for the interpration of studies on cellular or biochemical changes, to describe in detail the area were samples were obtained.'],\n",

For comparative purposes, an inherited storage disease (bèta-mannosidosis) and a drug-induced neurotoxicosis (closantel overdose) are also presented. The aims of this thesis were:\\r\\n(1) to document the pathology of those conditions where detailed descriptions were lacking,\\r\\n(2) to study the light and transmission electron microscopical lesions from a differential diagnostic perspective, and, \\r\\n(3) to consider the possible causative mechanisms of the nervous lesions. \\r\\n   A novel lysosomal storage disease in goats induced by the plant Ipomoea carnea is reported. Analysis of plant material confirmed the presence of swainsonine and two glycosidase inhibitors, namely, calystegine B2 and calystegine C1.  The storage disease is analogous to the lysosomal storage disease in ruminants induced by ingestion of locoweeds (Astragalus and Oxytropis spp.) and poison peas (Swainsona spp) and closely mimics inherited a-mannosidosis in animals. ?-Mannosidosis is documented in Hereford calves, a breed not previously known to be afflicted by this inherited disorder. The condition was biochemically confirmed by an absence of lymphocyte ?-mannosidase activity in one of the affected calves.  \\r\\n   \\x91Maldronksiekte\\x92 in cattle, caused by ingestion of the plant Solanum kwebense, is characterised by degeneration, necrosis and loss of cerebellar Purkinje cells and, to a lesser extent, neurons in cerebellar nuclei. Affected Purkinje neurons were either swollen, pale and finely vacuolated or shrunken and more eosinophilic than normal. In the present study, some Purkinje cells and neurons in cerebellar nuclei stained strongly with Canavalia ensiformis (ConA) agglutinin and weakly with Triticum vulgaris (WGA) and succinyl-WGA (S-WGA) agglutinins. The neuronal lesions were not caused by apoptosis as tested by a commercial deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling (TUNEL) method. Based on the selective involvement and nature of lesions in cerebellar Purkinje cells, \\x91maldronksiekte\\x92 is classified as an acquired cerebellar cortical degeneration and not a lysosomal storage disease. \\r\\n   Four toxic myelinopathies are described; three are induced by plants (Helichrysum argyrosphaerum, Ornithogalum prasinum and O. saundersiae and Crotalaria sparthioides) and one is caused by overdosage of the anthelmintic compound closantel. The four conditions are characterized by indistinguishable spongy changes (status spongiosis) in the central nervous system caused by splitting of myelin lamellae at the intraperiod line consistent with myelin oedema. The brain lesions in toxicity with Crotalaria sparthioides in cattle are typical for hepatic encephalopathy secondary to cirrhosis. The pyrrolizidine alkaloid senkirkine was isolated from toxic plant material. Primary toxic retinal degeneration was present in poisoning by Helichrysum argyrosphaerum and in closantel poisoning. \\r\\n   Finally, the pathology of acute and chronic Aspergillus clavatus intoxication in cattle is studied. In acute cases there is chromatolysis and cytoplasmic vacuolation particularly of motor neurons in the ventral horns throughout the spinal cord. Electron microscopy revealed disintegration of Nissl bodies, abundant free ribosomes and increased numbers of mitochondria and dense bodies comparable to the axonal reaction. In chronic cases fed sorghum beer residues, extensive, bilaterally symmetrical Wallerian degeneration in ascending and descending tracts throughout the length of the spinal cord were seen. This neuromycotoxicosis is classified as a neuronopathy/axonopathy.\\r\\n   A histological feature of all the conditions that are described in this thesis is the presence of vacuolation of varying severity in neurons and/or neuropil in the central nervous system of affected animals. Apart from the storage diseases, the pathogenesis of the nervous lesions is largely unknown.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Transport of T3 and T4 across the plasma membrane is the first step in the sequence of intracellular thyroid hormone action. It is generally accepted that this is mediated by specific carrier proteins. The knowledge about these proteins in liver is abundant, but information about thyroid hormone uptake into the heart is scarce. The aim of this thesis was to characterize the cell physiological properties of T3 and T4 uptake in heart and to obtain information on the molecular structure(s) of the transport protein(s). \\nExperiments with neonatal rat cardiomyocytes showed that T3 and T4 uptake is mediated by an energy- and temperature-dependent mechanism, which is not dependent on the Na+ gradient. Furthermore, T3 uptake is reduced by tryptophan, a ligand for the amino acid system T, suggesting the involvement of an accessory transport mechanism. T3 and T4 uptake have also been explored in the embryonic rat heart derived cell line H9c2(2-1). In these cells, they were found to display similar characteristics as those of the neonatal cardiomyocytes. Interestingly, uptake of T3 and T4 also exhibited mutual inhibition; unlabeled T3 inhibited the uptake of T4, and vice versa. Based on these properties of T3 and T4 uptake and their mutual inhibition, we suggest that heart cells share a common mechanism for the uptake of T3 and T4. This is different from the situation in the liver, where two separate carriers for T3 and T4 have been described.\\nThe potential clinical importance of this tissue-selectivity is the development of thyromimetic agents that improve cardiac contractility and decrease plasma cholesterol without increasing the beating frequency of the heart. A number of thyroid hormone metabolites and analogues were tested for their effects on T3 uptake in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. Only 3,3\\x92-diiodothyronine (3,3\\x92-T2) and diiodothyropropionic acid (DITPA) were found to interfere with plasma membrane uptake of T3, while triiodothyroacetic acid (Triac) was taken up in significant amounts by the cardiomyocytes but probably by a mechanism different from that of T3.\\nBecause expression cloning in Xenopus laevis oocytes of mRNA, isolated from neonatal or adult rat hearts, did not result in a stimulation of T3 uptake, we were not able to identify the molecular structure of the T3 transporter in heart. On the other hand, uptake studies in oocytes injected with the cRNA encoding the fatty acid translocase (FAT) demonstrated that FAT induces thyroid hormone uptake. Furthermore, T3 uptake by FAT did not depend on the Na+ gradient, which is in accordance with the cell physiological studies described in this thesis. These observations suggest that fatty acid transporters may play a role in thyroid hormone uptake in heart. \\nIn summary, uptake of T3 and T4 in the heart is mediated by a common mechanism which is energy- and temperature dependent, but not Na+-dependent. The molecular basis of this mechanism needs to be further examined as well as the physiological role of transporters like FAT.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Epidemiological studies in man and experimental studies in animals have shown that serum and liver cholesterol levels are influenced by both environmental and genetic factors. Research that aims to dissect which genetic factors are involved in the differences of blood and hepatic cholesterol levels requires standardization of both environmental circumstances and the genetic background. Therefore, genetically defined laboratory animals are indispensable for these studies. In this thesis the four rat inbred strains, BC/CpbU (BC), BN.lx/Cub (BN), LEW/OlaHsd (LEW) and SHR/OlaIpcv (SHR),  selected for their response to a cholesterol-rich diet, have been used. BN and LEW are hyperresponders whereas BC and SHR are hyporesponders with respect to serum cholesterol levels. The strains differ also for liver cholesterol accumulation. \\r\\nThe BN, SHR and the recombinant inbred (RI) strains, derived from the progenitors BN and SHR, have been used. The genetic linkage map that is based on these RI strains has been extended by using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers. \\r\\nDNA from the BN and SHR have been used to amplify the Fabp6 gene. As no polymorphism could be detected between the BN and the SHR, the location of Fabp6 has been determined by screening a radiation hybrid (RH) panel with rat specific primers. The chromosomal location was, as expected, on rat chromosome 10, in the vicinity of a QTL for liver cholesterol concentration. \\r\\nThe F2 progeny of a cross between BC and LEW has been used for the construction of a genetic linkage map, consisting of 258 polymorphic DNA markers. This F2 progeny has been used for QTL analysis for the parameters basal serum cholesterol levels (before a cholesterol-rich diet), and for the post-dietary (i.e. after a cholesterol-rich diet) levels of serum cholesterol, liver cholesterol, serum phospholipids and circulating steroid hormones. For basal serum cholesterol levels, QTLs has been found on chromosome 1 and 7. For post-dietary serum cholesterol levels, two significant QTLs have been found, on chromosome 2 and 16. For liver cholesterol concentrations, two suggestive associations have been found on chromosome 6 and 10. For serum phospholipids level, a QTL has been found on chromosome 11. For postdietary aldosterone levels, two significant QTLs have been found on chromosome 1 and 18. \\r\\nChapters 6 and 7 deal with the chromosomal localization of genes that are involved in the biosynthesis, metabolism and transport of cholesterol by using the RH panel. \\r\\nIn conclusion, this thesis describes the work that has been performed for increasing the marker density of the genetic map of the rat and for the localization of QTLs and genes involved in the cholesterol metabolism in this species. This contributes to the value of the rat as an animal model in studies towards the role of cholesterol in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis an other cholesterol related diseases'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Vitamin C (ascorbic acid), which is a potent antioxidant, recently has received a great deal of attention because of its positive action on the immune response and disease resistance of animals. Brief reviews are presented on ascorbic acid metabolism in animals and its relation with stressful conditions. The original research in this thesis is concerned mainly with the identification of various factors that are related with vitamin C status in Sudanese camels (Camelus dromedarius) kept under natural grazing conditions. The study was conducted in the  Butana area, Central Sudan. As indicators of vitamin C status, the concentrations of ascorbic acid in blood, leukocytes, organs and milk were used. Irrespective of the season, the highest tissue ascorbic acid levels were observed in adrenals and liver, and the lowest levels were in heart. There were breed variations in vitamin C status, Arabi camels having the highest plasma ascorbic acid concentrations and Bishari\\x92s the lowest, the Anafi\\x92s showing intermediate values. In the Sudanese camels, gender did not affect plasma ascorbic acid concentrations. However, female camels excreted more ascorbic acid with urine than did males. The breeding season was associated with a reduction of vitamin C status in both males and females. Estrus versus non-estrus was associated with high plasma and leukocyte ascorbic acid concentrations. Lactating Arabi camels had higher plasma and leukocyte ascorbic acid levels than did their pregnant counterparts. The stage of lactation was associated with plasma vitamin C levels, the levels being higher when the animals were more than 180 days in lacatation. The ascorbic acid levels in milk parallelled those in plasma. Multiparous camels had higher ascorbic acid concentrations in their milk than did primiparous animals. New-born calves had higher plasma ascorbic acid concentrations than their dams. In the calves, plasma ascorbic acid declined as from birth and had stabilized after four weeks. In the dams, plasma ascorbic acid rose from parturition and reached a steady value after four weeks. Colostrum contained more ascorbic acid than milk. The simulated habitual diet of Sudanese camels, when compared with alfalfa as sole source of nutrition, lowered plasma and leukocyte levels of ascorbic acid. Infections due to sarcoptic mange, helminthiasis and trypanosomiasis were associated with a lowering of vitamin C status, the latter  infection having the greatest impact. Brucellosis was associated with a reduction of ascorbic acid status and was so mastitis. It is assumed that ascorbic acid status is a reflection of disease resistance. The data may also indicate that infectious diseases may further lower disease resistance and that female camels in non-estrus versus those in estrus, pregnant versus lactating, non-pregnant camels, breeding versus non-breeding animals and Bishari versus Arabi and Anafi camels might be more sensitive to disease. Dietary supplements should be identified that enhance vitamin C status in Sudanese camels as their habitual, free-range diet tends to lower the status.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Ehrlichia ruminantium is an obligate intracellular bacterium that can cause a disease in ruminants known as heartwater. The vertebrate host becomes infected when infected Amblyomma ticks (nymphs or adults) feed on it. When the host survives the infection it becomes a carrier. Ticks become infected with E. ruminantium when they feed on an infected host. The infection is transmitted from one developmental stage to the other except from adult to eggs for as far as is known now. Detection of E. ruminantium is difficult, especially in carrier animals, and is based on either detection of antibodies (MAP1-B ELISA) or detection of bacterial DNA using PCR techniques. The purpose of the research was to molecularly characterize E. ruminantium and to develop new or improved diagnostic tests for the detection of E. ruminantium. For the detection the MAP1-B ELISA was further validated using the TG-ROC method to determine cutoff values with equal sensitivity and specificity, and a new assay based on the reverse line blot (RLB) technique was developed. The developed RLB assays can simultaneously detect and identify 8 Anaplasma and Ehrlichia species. For the characterization several 16S rRNA sequences were determined, which were also used for a reorganization of the taxonomic classification of several rickettsial species. Finally, the transcription of the map1 multigene family was studied in different environments and it was found that map1-1 was transcribed in vitro and in vivo in the vector tick whereas it was not transcribed at a detectable level in vitro in bovine endothelial cells.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Fatty acid supply of growing pigs in Central Vietnam'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['This thesis concerns the influence of essential dietary fatty acids on the fatty acid composition of adipose tissue and growth performance of growing pigs kept on samll holdings in Central Vietnam. Essential fatty acids cannot be synthesized by the body and have to be ingested with the feed. There are two families of essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) that cannot be metabolically interconverted. Linoleic acid (LA; C18:2 n-6) is the parent compound of the n-6 PUFAs and aleph-linolenic acid (ALA; C18:3 n-3) that of the n-3 PUFAs. In the body, LA can be converted into the n-6 PUFA arachidonic acid (AA; C20:4 n-6) and ALA can be elongated and desaturated to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; C20:5 n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; C22:6 n-3). The n-6 and n-3 PUFAs are essential structural components of the cell membranes and are precursors of eicosanoids, compounds affecting functions such as immunity, platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction. It is well-known that the quantitative intakes of n-6 and n-3 PUFAs are reflected in the adipose tissue of non-ruminants. This implies not only that the fatty acid composition of adipose tissue can be modulated by diet, but also that the adipose tissue composition can be used as an index of the qualitative PUFA intake. The LA requirement of growing pigs has been set at 0.08 g/MJ metabolizable energy (ME), but the requirement of ALA is not known. \\nThe present research shows that the intakes of LA, ALA, EPA or DHA are directly correlated with their concentrations in adipose tissue of growing pigs, and the correlations can be expressed in the form of equations with high degree of predictability. The current recommended intake of LA for growing pigs, i.e. 0.08 g/MJ of metabolizable energy, may be too low to support maximum growth in growing pigs in Central Vietnam, their LA intake required for maximum growth being about 2 g/MJ. ALA intakes up to an intake level of 0.3 g/MJ may increase average daily gain (ADG) in pigs kept on the Vietnamese farms. Based on a literature survey, it is concluded that the stimulatory effect of extra ALA intake on ADG pigs may not relate to improved disease resistance'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Displacement of the abomasum (DA) in dairy cows is a disorder described since the fifties of the previous century. Since then, a considerable amount of research concerning DA is conducted. The normal, healthy abomasum is positioned in the ventral part of the abdominal cavity. As a result of accumulation of gas (mainly methane and carbondioxide) the abomasum will float in the abdominal cavity; the displacement of the abomasum is present. The DA can occur to the left (90% of the cases), or to the right side. DA occurs most of the cases in the first four weeks after calving. The annual incidence of DA is increasing; up to 5 percent of the newly calved cows will get DA. There is suggested that this is only a small part of the total amount of animals experiencing difficulties with DA, since a practitioner will examine not every cow.\\nIn a field trial there are differences found between herds without DA and herds with high incidence of DA. Nutrition and cow management, both in the dry period as well as the milking period, are of major importance in the risk of DA. Experimental research reveals that prior to DA cows have a decreased feed intake, of the ingested feed a relative high proportion consists of concentrates, and they produce less milk. The position of the abomasum is higher prior to the development of DA. Prior to DA osmotic pressure of the rumen fluid is higher in DA cows. The following blood alterations were found in cows prior to DA; lower calcium, glucose, and insulin concentrations, and higher concentrations of free fatty acids and ketone bodies. \\nHowever, it is hard discriminate whether the pre-clinical alterations can be considered as causal factors of DA, or the alterations are part of a complex leading to DA.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Factors Affecting the Disposition of Ivermectin in the Target Species'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['It was the aim of the thesis to contribute to the understanding of the diverse factors involved in the pharmacokinetics of ivermectin, a very potent antiparasitic drug widely used in both human and veterinary medicine. Ivermectin is extensively eliminated in faeces as parent drug and less active metabolites, irrespective of species and route of administration. It is currently believed that biliary secretion is the major route for the elimination of parent ivermectin from blood. However, using validated in vitro (Caco-2 cells) and in situ (rat intestinal loops) models, we provide convincing evidence for an intestinal secretion of ivermectin from blood into the intestinal lumen. In the rat, intestinal secretion was even more important than biliary secretion in the overall elimination of parent ivermectin. These findings may initiate a re-appraisal of the disposition of ivermectin, particularly its distribution into the digestive tract, thereby allowing a better understanding of its clinical efficacy against gastrointestinal parasites. The above mentioned investigations also pointed towards the prominent role of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in the intestinal secretion process, although other transport mechanisms (multidrug resistance-associated protein MRP2) may be involved. The relevance of these findings for veterinary target species was demonstrated by examining the P-gp function in cattle, sheep, goats, pigs and horses using a lymphocyte-based ex vivo model. P-gp activity was found in peripheral blood lymphocytes of all animal species studied, albeit at different levels. In addition, P-gp expression was shown in the intestines for all species. These results provide mechanistic support for the intestinal secretion of ivermectin and other P-gp substrates. Since wide interspecies variations in P-gp activity were observed, it can be expected that the contribution of this secretion mechanism may differ from one species to the other.\\nFinally, we identified that physiological animal licking behaviour does obviously contribute to the disposition of ivermectin in cattle following topical application. Under our experimental conditions, 58-87% of the dose (500 mu-g/kg) applied topically over the back of cattle was actually ingested by licking, while only 10% of the dose was absorbed through the skin. Approximately 70% of the ingested ivermectin was not absorbed orally and transited directly into faeces, increasing by 5-fold the environmental burden of biologically active ivermectin. Our results suggest that the systemic exposure of topically-treated animals is related to their ability to lick themselves or each other. Furthermore, pharmacokinetic modeling was used to predict ivermectin disposition in cattle under various conditions of oral and/or percutaneous exposure. Our simulations suggest that non-treated cattle could get easily contaminated with ivermectin by social contact (allo-licking) with topically-treated animals present in the same herd.\\nIn conclusion, our findings may stimulate further investigations towards the contribution of intestinal secretion to the overall elimination of endectocides in target animal species. The examination of the role of P-gp and P-gp-like transporters (MRP2) in the relative disposition of different endectocides may be useful to understand differences in their pharmacokinetics and may support the development of new pharmaceutical formulations tailored towards individual compounds and target animal species.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Mastitis is the most common and costly production disease affecting dairy cows. Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus uberis are two major mastitis-causing pathogens. Staphylococcus aureus is traditionally classified as contagious pathogen, while Streptococcus uberis is classified as environmental pathogen. Infected udders form the main reservoir of contagious pathogens. Exposure to contagious pathogens is largely limited to the milking process. Environmental pathogens are present in the environment of the cow. Cows may be exposed at any time in life. We used a combination of molecular and mathematical methods to study whether S. aureus and S. uberis are indeed contagious and environmental pathogens, respectively. \\nPulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis and binary typing were used for strain typing of S. aureus and had higher typeability and discriminatory power than phage typing. Comparison of clinical and epidemiological observations with typing results revealed significant associations between distinct genotypes and severity of disease, suggesting strain-specific virulence. Analysis of human and bovine S. aureus isolates showed that strains clustered predominantly in host specific clones. Circumstantial evidence suggested an environmental origin of one S. aureus strain. Teat skin did not appear to be an important source of intramammary S. aureus. Random-amplified polymorphic DNA typing was used to characterize S. uberis strains. Within two herds, a variety of strains were found in addition to a predominant strain, suggesting co-existence of strains with environmental and contagious epidemiologies. Infections with dominant strains lasted longer than infections with unique strains. One dominant strain caused an outbreak of mastitis that was limited to lactating cows. The strain was also isolated from the milking machine. The combined evidence strongly supports contagious transmission during milking. \\nSIR-models were used to describe the spread of mastitis and simulate the impact of control measures. Prevalence of infection was a significant predictor for the number of new infections with S. uberis in one herd, as would be expected under the assumption of contagious transmission. Presence of other pathogens did not affect the susceptibility of udder quarters to new infection, but quarters that had recovered from infection were more susceptible than quarters that had not experienced mastitis. The same was true for S. aureus, as shown in a study of cow and quarter-level risk factors for new infections and by means of an SIR-model. Treatment of subclinical mastitis and prevention of influx of infected animals contribute to elimination of S. aureus mastitis from a herd under the assumption that S. aureus is spread solely through contagious transmission. However, even when R, the reproduction ratio, was lower than the threshold value of 1, indicating that contagious transmission was curbed, new infections continued to occur. Among other things, this may be the result of infections that originate from environmental sources.\\nIn summary, stain typing studies and mathematical models suggest that both S. aureus and S. uberis are genetically varied species that include strains with contagious transmission as well as strains with environmental epidemiology. This implies that both options have to be considered when studying mastitis epidemiology or choosing control measures for dairy herd management'],\n",

At present, however, there is little known about the pathogenesis of feline AD.\\nThe aim was to investigate various aspects of the immunopathogenesis in a defined group of cats with signs and symptoms of atopic dermatitis and compare our findings with the immunoregulation of atopic dermatitis in humans. \\nThe presence of antigen-specific IgE in serum of AD cats was investigated by means of the Prausnitz-Küstner (PK) test and the passive cutaneous anaphylaxis test (PCA). Positive reactions in the PCA-test and PK-test were observed with both heated sera and unheated sera. These results indicate that heat-stabile cytophilic antibodies, as well as heat-labile antibodies may be involved. \\nThe occurrence of Langerhans cells (LC) was investigated. Significantly higher numbers of CD1a+ cells and MHC class II+ cells were observed in the epidermis and dermis of AD cats. Immunofluorescence-double labeling revealed staining of CD1a+ cells with MHC class II antibody. In some LC the typical tennis-racket-shaped Birbeck granules were observed with electronmicroscopy.\\nIn the dermis of lesional and nonlesional skin of AD cats a significantly higher number of CD3+ T cells, with a predominance of CD4+ T cells, was observed in lesional and nonlesional skin. In skin of healthy control animals only few CD4+ T cells were observed. The CD4+/CD8+ cell ratio in peripheral blood did not differ significantly between AD cats and control cats. \\nIL-4+ cells were found in the epidermis in lesional skin only and in the superficial dermis, in both lesional and nonlesional skin. Very few IL-4+ cells were present in the dermis of the control animals. The IL-4+ cells co-stained with antibodies against CD4 and a pan-T cell whilst double-labeling of IL-4 and mast cell chymase was observed in only a few cells. Cross-reactivity of the antibody against human IL-4 with feline IL-4 was confirmed by Western blotting with recombinant fIL-4. \\nMast cells (MC) and eosinophils were quantified and MC were characterized according to their protease content, i.e. chymase and tryptase. In both healthy cats and cats with AD, the MC counts varied considerably, albeit in the diseased cats at a significantly higher level than in the healthy cats. Eosinophils were exclusively found in cats with atopic dermatitis. In lesional and nonlesional skin a significantly lower number of tryptase-containing MC were found in comparison with chymase- containing MC. A significant difference in the number of tryptase-positive MC in lesional and nonlesional skin of AD cats was not observed. \\nAtopy patch testing (APT) was adapted for cats. Erythematous skin reactions were observed after 24-hours in 1 cat and after 48-hours in 3 cats (n=6) with AD. No reactions were seen at the negative control sites of atopic cats nor did any of the healthy control cats display positive APT reactions. \\nThe cellular infiltrate in the skin of biopsy sites at 24 hours after APT revealed significantly increased numbers of IL-4+, CD4+, CD3+, MHC class II+ and CD1a+ cells in one AD cat with visually positive patch test reactions. All AD cats (except one) had significantly increased IL-4+ T cell numbers at 24 and /or 48 hours APT sites. \\nIn summary, these findings suggest that the immunopathogenesis of atopic dermatitis in cats may be comparable to that in humans. However, in view of the current knowledge, it might be more prudent to call this entity \"feline atopy-like dermatitis\"'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['One of the most important allergic diseases caused by chemicals, contact hypersensitivity (CHS) or skin sensitization, forms a serious problem for individuals experiencing such a reaction. The prevalence of CHS tends to grow proportionally to the increasing exposure to an expanding variety of chemicals. Predictive animal tests to identify sensitizing properties of chemicals are therefore carried out at a large scale. For a better risk assessment, a more quantitative assessment of the sensitizing potency of chemicals is needed. These two current developments result in an increasing number of animals used. The aim of this thesis was to evaluate the risk assessment process for sensitizing potency of contact allergens in a more reliable manner, and to investigate the possibility of developing alternative approaches to in vivo testing, which may ultimately lead to a refinement, reduction, or replacement of animal testing. \\nWith the in vivo approach described in this thesis, we are now able to assess the potency of sensitizing chemicals in a more accurate way. This results in a better estimation of the minimal number of test animals needed, which inevitably leads to a decrease in animal use. Another important issue is that this predictive method also provides us with information about the threshold of an allergen. Data on thresholds in humans cannot be derived directly from animal tests. Therefore, we developed an in vitro assay where cytokine responses derived from both murine as human epidermal cells (keratinocytes) were used as read-out for sensitizing strength. The in vitro approach provided us with more insight on the differences in sensitivity between the two species. With these findings it is now possible to interpolate in vivo data towards an estimation of risk in man. The use of cytokines for the assessment of sensitizing potency seems promising and is one of numerous possibilities of in vitro tests for the assessment of sensitizing potency.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae causes porcine pleuropneumonia, a disease that occurs world-wide and affects growing pigs of all ages. Infection of pigs with A. pleuropneumoniae can result in high morbidity and mortality. The present work contributes to the understanding of the pathogenesis of A. pleuropneumoniae by providing important novel insights into several major virulence traits of the pathogen.\\r\\nThe RTX toxins ApxI, ApxII and ApxIII are essential for the development of clinical symptoms and lesions typical for A. pleuropneumoniae infections. However, most serotypes of A. pleuropneumoniae produce in vivo more than one toxin. To assess the relative contribution of ApxI and ApxII to the infection, the ability of different Apx mutants of A. pleuropneumoniae serotype 1 to induce lesions was investigated. The results indicate that the production of more than one toxin enhances virulence of A. pleuropneumoniae.\\r\\nAdherence to host tissue is regarded as an important first step in the colonisation of the host. In this thesis, we describe an in vitro infection model to study the interaction of A. pleuropneumoniae with primary cultures of porcine lung epithelial cells [LEC]. The efficient binding of A. pleuropneumoniae to LEC indicates that adherence to epithelial cells in the lower respiratory tract may constitute an important step in the pathogenesis. In search for the mechanism of the adherence event, the role of LPS was investigated. On the basis of the results with LEC, LPS seems not to be involved in adherence of A. pleuropneumoniae to cells of the lower respiratory tract. \\r\\nIn an attempt to identify factors involved in adherence of A. pleuropneumoniae, we focussed on fimbriae. Fimbriae mediate adherence in a number of species and have been isolated recently from A. pleuropneumoniae. The genome of A. pleuropneumoniae was found to contain at least four genes involved in type IV fimbriae biogenesis. The functionality of the fimbriae genes was demonstrated by expression of these genes from a constitutively active promoter, which resulted in fimbrial subunits and in fimbriae protruding from the bacterial cell surface. The involvement of fimbriae in adherence to LEC could not be demonstrated. Noteworthy is the presence of an alanine in contrast to the consensus glycine at position -1 from the cleavage site of the fimbrial subunit protein ApfA. This appears to be an intrinsic trait of ApfA.\\r\\nThe apparent lack of fimbriae expression under routine laboratory growth conditions led us to investigate the conditions necessary for fimbriae promoter activity using a promoter trap vector. The fimbriae promoter appears to be intact but is subject to regulation. Expression of the fimbriae promoter was dependent on the growth phase, was seen only in chemically defined medium and was strongly induced in A. pleuropneumoniae that were adhering to primary cultures of LEC. The latter suggests that contact with epithelial cells may be a trigger for fimbriae production. The importance of a more natural setting for the induction of fimbriae promoter activity was further underlined by our finding that the fimbriae promoter was active in vivo after endobronchial inoculation of pigs.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The thesis describes epidemiological research carried out to improve the control of classical swine fever virus (CSFV) epidemics. First, control measures and strategies are investigated in order to enable quick and adequate action upon CSFV detection. CSFV transmission experiments are described, as well as a mathematical model of CSFV transmission between herds, both used to assess the effectiveness of the E2 subunit marker vaccines with respect to CSFV transmission. Quantification of the effectiveness was done with the \\x91basic reproduction ratio\\x92 Ri (Rh), defined as the number of animals (herds) that is infected by one typical infectious animal (herd) in a completely susceptible population. \\r\\nThe transmission experiments pointed out that Ri decreases to below the threshold value 1 as of three weeks after vaccination until at least six months after vaccination. Already one week after vaccination of a pig herd, virus entry will lead to only minor outbreaks. It appeared that the presence of maternal antibodies at the time of vaccination may reduce the antibody levels at later age, but these lower levels still keep Ri below 1.\\r\\nBecause vertical transmission is not completely blocked by the vaccine, persistently infected piglets might be born on vaccinated herds. These herds cannot be clinically detected and might thus be a risk for further virus spread. Detection will be possible if some animals, e.g. the breeding sows, on those herds remain unvaccinated. Whether that would lead to an effective control strategy was tested in a mathematical model of CSFV transmission. The model was based on the Dutch CSFV epidemic of 1997/1998, with a moderately virulent virus strain in a pig dense area with relatively many multiplier herds. The model results point out that an effective control strategy (Rh < 1) requires a complete prohibition of transport of unvaccinated animals. Moreover, in addition to the control measures that are obliged by EU legislation (like the tracing of infectious contacts and hygiene measures), the virus transmission between herds should be halved, e.g. by vaccinating 50% of all pig herds. If all animals but the breeding sows would be vaccinated, the demands for a successful control strategy are well met. \\r\\nIn addition to the investigation of control measures and strategies, a tool was tested, which had been developed to analyse the effectiveness of the control strategy in an ongoing epidemic. The tool was designed to use data of an ongoing epidemic for estimation of Rh and the number of infected, yet undetected herds. The only data needed for the calculations are the numbers of detected herds in each week of the epidemic. Unfortunately, the only result the model could generate was whether Rh was smaller or larger than 1. Further mathematical research is needed to understand the shortcomings. Until then, some extra data might be used, e.g. an estimate of the number of infected herds at the day of the first detection, or an estimate of the average time between infection of a herd and detection.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Parasitic nematode infections are still one of the major causes of production losses in temperate regions of the world, with the majority of these infections involving the intestinal lumen dwelling nematode Cooperia oncophora and its abomasal counterpart Ostertagia ostertagi. Although nematode parasitism is common in animals of all age classes, calves entering the first grazing season are the most susceptible age group. Therefore, most work on nematode infection in cattle refers to calves. In general, C. oncophora has not received much attention compared to other nematodes and this is mainly caused by the mild pathogenicity of the worm. In natural conditions, clinical parasitism as caused by C. oncophora is rarely seen. Infection has been associated with production losses but the use of effective anthelmintics (anti-worm drugs) during the last decades has reduced its clinical importance. Increasing concerns over the presence of drug residues in food animals, the incidence of anthelmintic resistance and the escalating costs of the development of new anthelmintics all suggest that alternative control strategies must be developed. The most likely alternative for anthelmintics would be a vaccine, but this requires an improved understanding of the immune response, together with a more detailed knowledge of the host-parasite interactions.\\nWe used C. oncophora infections in calves as a model to investigate the mechanisms involved in the immune response against GI nematodes. Development of immunity to C. oncophora is relatively fast. Using experimental infections with 100,000 L3 in 3-month-old calves, animals can be differentiated in High, Intermediate and Low responders. Until now, this differentiation relied solely on parasitological variables. In the first part of this thesis, the systemic and local immune response following a primary infection with 100,000 L3 C. oncophora was characterized. The results show that calves classified into different responder types based on parasitological variables, also feature a different immune response. The detailed analysis of the immunological and parasitological events occurring in the gut of Low and Intermediate responder animals allowed us to identify putative mechanisms involved in worm expulsion.\\nBaseed on the data from primary infected animals, we knew that acquired immunity is developed in Intermediate but not in Low responders. Under natural conditions, animals are re-infected after turn-out during the second grazing season. Hence, it is important to know whether the immunity generated during primary infection is long-lasting and protective against re-infection. To address this question, animals primed with 30,000 or 100,000 L3 were re-infected with a single dose of 100,000 L3. A detailed analysis of the parasitological features was performed to investigate two different issues: the effect of the infection dose on the development of immunity against re-infection and, whether the more resistant phenotype of Intermediate responders was sustained after challenge. Finally, the role of the B-cell and T-cell compartment and respective effectors was compared among primary and secondary infected animals.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Hyperadrenocorticism in ferrets'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Hyperadrenocorticism is a common disease in ferrets. In recent years evidence has accumulated that this disease differs from hyperadrenocorticism in humans, dogs, and cats, in that adrenocortical sex steroids, rather than cortisol play, an important role in the pathogenesis. In this study attention was focused on the possible pathogenetic role of high plasma concentrations of gonadotropic hormones as a result of neutering.\\r\\nFirst, plasma concentrations of ACTH and a-MSH in ferrets with hyperadrenocorticism were not found to be significantly different from those of healthy neutered ferrets. Therefore, this disease should be regarded as a normocortisolemic and corticotropin-independent condition. In contrast, a distinct seasonal variation in the UCCR was observed in healthy intact ferrets, and in two neutered hyperadrenocorticoid ferrets, and an increased UCCR was measured in privately owned ferrets with hyperadrenocorticism. However, no seasonal fluctuation in the UCCRs was seen in healthy neutered ferrets. Sexual arousal may play a role in healthy ferrets and in the hyperadrenocorticoid ferrets with an elevated UCCR during the breeding season. One has to assume, however, that only small amounts of cortisol are produced, insufficient to cause suppression of ACTH.\\r\\nTwo of ten ferrets with hyperadrenocorticism studied had a pituitary tumor. These tumors did not stain for any of the pituitary hormones, but had characteristics of clinically non-functional gonadotrope tumors. Gonadal feedback on hypothalamic GnRH, as a result of neutering, may have initiated pituitary tumor development.\\r\\nIn a survey held among Dutch ferret owners, a prevalence of hyperadrenocorticism (0.55%: 95% confidence interval: 0.2   1.1%) was found. Also a linear correlation between age at neutering and age at time of diagnosis of hyperadrenocorticism was found, indicating that neutering, and possibly gonadotropic hormones, play a role in the development of hyperadrenocorticism in ferrets.\\r\\nThe next step was to study the presence and function of gonadotropin receptors in the adrenal glands of healthy ferrets and of ferrets with hyperadrenocorticism. Positive immunohistochemical staining with a luteinizing hormone receptor (LH-R) antibody was found in adrenal glands from young, healthy, intact ferrets. In addition, adrenal hyperplasias and neoplasias from ferrets with hyperadrenocorticism stained positive for the LH-R. To investigate the functionality of the LH-Rs, in vivo GnRH stimulation tests were performed with healthy neutered ferrets and neutered ferrets with hyperadrenocorticism. These studies showed that although LH-Rs are present in the adrenals of young healthy ferrets, they are not functional. Based on in vitro stimulation test, performed with adrenal cells suspended in culture medium, it became clear that neither GnRH nor FSH had a significant influence on the production of adrenocortical steroids, whereas hCG induced the production of these hormones.\\r\\nSince surgical neutering seems to be a major risk factor in the development of hyperadrenocorticism in ferrets, the literature was reviewed for current and future alternatives for surgical neutering of ferrets. Of the alternatives, the use of progestagens seems the most practical in jills, but the effect of these drugs in hobs is uncertain. Other potential alternatives for the future may be slow-release GnRH implants, GnRH antagonists, or immunization against GnRH'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), a member of the family Birnaviridae (Dobos et al., 1979), is the causative agent of a highly contagious immunosuppressive disease in young chickens. IBDV multiplies rapidly in developing B lymphocytes in the bursa of Fabricius, leading to immunosuppression. This increases susceptibility to infections with opportunistic pathogens and reduces the growth rate of surviving animals. \\r\\nIBDV is a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) virus. Its two genome segments are encapsidated together with multiple copies of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, VP1, in a single-shelled capsid that is composed of VP2 and VP3. The other (non-structural) viral proteins of IBDV are VP4, a protease, and VP5, which is not essential for viral replication in vitro but important for virus-induced pathogenicity .\\r\\nViral proteins generally function by interactions with viral and/or host cell proteins. Information about these interactions is thus essential for understanding the infection process. The aim of this thesis therefore was to initiate making the inventory of interactions essential to the IBDV life cycle. To this end, we employed the then recently developed yeast two-hybrid system. \\r\\nFirst, we focussed on the homo- and heteromeric interactions of the known viral proteins. A heterologous interaction between VP1 and VP3, and homologous interactions of  VP2, VP3,  VP4, VP5, and possibly of VP1, were found by co-expression of the fusion proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The presence of the VP1-VP3 complex in IBDV-infected cells was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation studies. Kinetic analyses showed that the complex of VP1 and VP3 is formed in the cytoplasm and eventually is released into the cell-culture medium, indicating that VP1-VP3 complexes are present in mature virions. \\r\\nThen, we identified the domains responsible for these interactions. The VP1 interacting domain of VP3 was mapped to the extreme carboxy-terminal domain of the polypeptide. This interaction appeared to be crucial for the production of infectious progeny. These investigations also revealed that VP3 additionally binds to both the viral dsRNA segments. The mapping of the individual contact sites on the self-interacting viral proteins VP2, VP3, VP4 and VP5 revealed that VP2 possesses multiple interaction domains, consistent with available structural information about this external capsid protein. VP3-VP3 interactions were mapped to the amino-terminal part of the polypeptide. No interaction sites could be assigned to the VP4 protein; any deletion applied abolished its self-association. And for VP5, one interaction domain was detected in its central, most hydrophobic region, supporting the idea that this virulence determinant may function as a membrane pore-forming protein in infected cells. \\r\\nFinally, we performed a yeast two-hybrid search for candidate cellular proteins of the bursa of Fabricius interacting with VP1, VP2, VP3 and VP5. We found that several host cell proteins are able to form complexes with the viral proteins of IBDV in yeast cells. A specific interaction of VP1 with the carboxy-terminal domain of eukaryotic initiation factor 4AII (eIF4AII), a key component in the initiation of eukaryotic translation of both capped and uncapped mRNAs, was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation. The biological relevance of the potential VPg-eIF4AII interaction is discussed.\\r\\nIt is now clear that VP3 is the key organizer of the birnavirus structure as it maintains critical interactions with all components of the viral particle: itself, VP2, VP1 and the two genomic dsRNAs. Different domains in the protein are responsible for these different interactions. The association of eIF4AII with IBDV VP1 will require future studies to confirm and establish the functional significance of this interaction for viral multiplication.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Studies on the role of vasopressin in canine polyuria'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Observations in 89 healthy dogs indicate that the ranges of urine specific gravity (1.006 - >1.050) and urine osmolality (Uosm, 161 \\x96 2830 mOsm/kg) are much larger than previously thought. In addition to the large interindividual variation in Uosm, in some dogs Uosm varied widely during the day with two- to three-fold increases or decreases in Uosm often occurring within two hours. Because of these wide spontaneous fluctuations in Uosm, documentation of polyuria cannot be based on the measurement of a low Uosm in one single urine sample.\\nVasopressin (VP) release in dogs with secondary polycythaemia due to renal neoplasm is impaired during hypertonic saline infusion, with a markedly increased osmotic threshold and a low sensitivity of the response.\\nPrimary polydipsia is characterised by a marked increase in water intake that cannot be explained as a compensatory mechanism for excessive fluid loss. Serial measurements of Uosm (collected every 2 hours for 24 hours, with an interval of 4 hours during the night) demonstrated large fluctuations in Uosm in several of the dogs fulfilling the criteria of primary polydipsia with some Uosm values exceeding 1000 mOsm/kg. It can be concluded that a water deprivation test is not needed in all polyuric dogs. When pronounced fluctuations are found in Uosm during serial measurements and some Uosm values exceed 1000 mOsm/kg, the diagnosis of primary polydipsia seems justified. In all dogs with primary polydipsia the VP response to osmotic stimulation was disturbed, which may be interpreted as a primary disturbance in the regulation of VP secretion, although it might also be the result of overhydration caused by a primary abnormality in drinking behaviour.\\nAfter exclusion of most of the conditions leading to polyuria, there may remain the diagnostic dilemma of differentiating between central diabetes insipidus, primary polydipsia, and nephrogenic abnormalities. The most powerful diagnostic tool for differentiation of these conditions is the hypertonic saline infusion test, with measurement of plasma osmolality (Posm) and plasma VP concentration. Eighteen young polyuric dogs were categorised according to the plasma VP response to hypertonic saline infusion. Three categories could be distinguished: (a) a hyperresponse, (b) a hyporesponse, and (c) a non-linear response with high VP values unrelated to increases in Posm. The high VP values may represent bursts of VP release, similar to those that occur in the syndrome of inappropriate VP secretion (SIADH), or they may reflect the (normal) pulsatile VP release. As the VP response to hypertonic saline infusion did not consistently distinguish between the different clinical conditions (e.g. inadequate concentrating ability and primary polydipsia), the data question the generally accepted notion that VP measurements during hypertonic saline infusion are the \"gold standard\" for the diagnosis of polyuric conditions.\\nIn the dog, VP is secreted in a pulsatile fashion with a wide variation in the number of VP pulses, VP pulse duration, and VP pulse amplitude and height. Mild dehydration does not influence VP pulsatile secretion, whereas osmotic stimulation significantly increases basal and pulsatile VP release in the dog. The pulsatile secretion pattern of VP in dogs may explain part of the non-linear VP responses to osmotic stimulation, occurring in some polyuric dogs as described above. The occurrence of spontaneous VP pulses may severely hamper the interpretation of the curve describing the relationship between Posm and plasma VP concentration during osmotic stimulation.\\nA radioimmunoassay for the measurement of urinary aquaporin-2 (U-AQP2) excretion in dogs is described. Basal U-AQP2 excretion in healthy dogs, expressed as the U-AQP2/creatinine ratio, varied similarly to the large individual variation in U-AQP2 excretion found in humans. Urinary AQP2 excretion in dogs closely reflects changes in collecting duct exposure to VP, as demonstrated by the responses to oral water loading, osmotic stimulation, and intravenous desmopressin administration. As in humans, U-AQP2 excretion may be of use as a diagnostic tool in canine polyuria, for the differentiation of (partial) central diabetes insipidus, (partial) nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, primary polydipsia, and SIADH.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['In this study we have investigated individual differences in coping with management-related stressors such as cross-fostering, weaning and mixing. \\nAnimals differ in the way they cope with stressors. An active coping strategy is characterized by an autonomous response, with higher heart rate, blood pressure and blood glucose levels, necessary for a fight or flight response, while a reactive (or \\x91passive\\x92) coping strategy is associated with conservation and withdrawal and characterized by a HPA response with elevated cortisol levels. The coping style is the preference of each individual for a certain coping strategy. Coping styles are determined by the personality, and the coping style and the situation determine the coping behaviour. \\nIn pigs, the backtest can be used as an instrument to measure (a dimension of) the coping style of the pigs at a young age. In this test, a piglet is put on its back and during 1 minute the number of escape attempts is recorded (mean 2-3, range 0-10). Active copers respond with many escape attempts (HR, high resisting), while reactive copers resist less (LR, low resisting). We performed backtests at 3, 10 and 17 days of age. \\nOur study results confirmed that weaning and mixing of pigs induced acute, physiologically measurable stress responses, while moving of pigs did not. Cross-fostering and mixing of pigs resulted in lower cell-mediated immune responses at 9 weeks of age, and more active behaviour at 10-12 weeks of age. Mixing enhanced humoral and cell-mediated immune responses shortly after the stressor, but mixed animals were more susceptible for infection with Salmonella later on. \\nCorrelations between successive backtests were about 0.4. The backtest is relatively consistent in a stable environment, but our cross-fostering study showed that backtest response in young piglets could change in an extreme social environment (uniform HR or LR pens). We found no associations between backtest response and salivary cortisol rise after weaning or mixing. Backtest responses were predictive for a human approach test at 5-7 weeks of age, but not for a novel object test or an open door test, or for these group tests at 10-12 weeks of age. Possibly, these tests measure different behavioural characteristics. \\nHR animals showed a better cell-mediated immune response after weaning and a lower risk of infection with Salmonella. HR animals also showed better performance results, with a higher daily weight gain in the fattening period, and a higher lean meat percentage and better carcass classification at slaughter. \\nHowever, it cannot be concluded that one coping style is \"better\" than the other. HR animals showed better performance results in mixed HR/LR groups. HR animals showed better cell-mediated immunity and lower susceptibility for infection with Salmonella, but once infected they might show a lower humoral immune response. \\nBecause of the association with lean meat percentage and daily weight gain, selection for production parameters will probably favour HR animals in the current husbandry systems. The organic farming systems which offer more stimuli (group housing, straw, outdoor area), probably favour the LR sows, because they may be better equipped to cope with a less predictable environment, as other studies showed. Furthermore, in group housing systems, the most active and aggressive HR animals will be excluded in the selection process.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Invasion of erythrocytes by Babesia bovis'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['In this thesis we investigated the invasion of erythrocytes taking place during the asexual erythrocytic blood stage of the apicomplexan parasites Babesia bovis parasite. \\nHost cell invasion by apicomplexan parasites is a complex process requiring multiple receptor-ligand interactions, involving association of the merozoite with the erythrocyte surface, reorientation and attachment of the apical end of the merozoite. In parasites like Toxoplasma gondii and Plasmodium falciparum many proteins have been identified that are involved in invasion including proteins present on the merozoite surface and proteins present in secretory organelles located at the apical end of the merozoite. An in vitro invasion assay of B. bovis was established to be able to characterize the mechanisms and the proteins involved in invasion. Invasion of liberated merozoites is completed in 1 h in phosphate buffered saline solution. The manipulation of intracellular calcium concentration or actin polymerization in the merozoite inhibits invasion indicating that B. bovis invades erythrocytes in a similar way as Plasmodium merozoites. Proteins that are secreted into the environment during in vitro invasion can be detected directly by protein staining after 2D gel electrophoresis. This in vitro invasion assay was used to assess the host-specificity of B.  bovis. In vivo, B. bovis infections have only been observed in bovine species. In vitro,  human, ovine, porcine, equine and caprine erythrocytes were all invaded by B. bovis. Human erythrocytes were invaded more efficiently than bovine erythrocytes, whereas goat erythrocytes were invaded at very low level. Significant differences in invasion efficiency into erythrocytes from different individuals of the same species were observed. Besides invasion, intracellular duplication of B. bovis parasites also took place in all erythrocyte species, except for goats. Only in bovine erythrocytes subsequent rounds of invasion were observed. B. bovis merozoite invasion was shown to be dependent on sialic-acid residues present on the host cell. Pre-incubation of merozoites with n-acetylneuraminyl-lactose decreased invasion efficiency by ~45%, whereas addition prior to invasion had no significant effect. Thus invasion might be dependent on the presence of merozoite membrane proteins already accessible during pre-incubation prior to invasion.\\nOnly two proteins (AMA-1 and TRAP) involved in invasion of other apicomplexans were identified from a large B. bovis EST database and these were sequenced and characterized. B. bovis invasion was inhibited by antiserum raised against peptides from several domains of AMA-1. Antisera raised against domain III of AMA-1 give the strongest invasion inhibition. B. bovis TRAP was surprisingly found in merozoites. In Plasmodium species TRAP has been found in the sporozoite stage. Antibodies directed against BbTRAP inhibited invasion. Immunofluorescence showed that B. bovis AMA-1 and TRAP are localized at the apical region of the merozoites. P. falciparum AMA-1 and TRAP proteins are known to be cleaved off and secreted into environment during invasion. 1D and 2D-gel electrophoresis of total merozoites extract and invasion supernatant followed by immunoblotting with B. bovis AMA-1 antisera showed that this protein is cleaved from 82 kDa to a 69 kDa and secreted into the surrounding environment. B. bovis TRAP also was found in invasion supernatant. \\nTransfection of in malaria parasites provides a valuable tool for analyzing gene function. An attempt was done to establish a transfection system of B. bovis with dhfr as a selectable marker. The B. bovis dhfr-ts genomic locus and cDNA was cloned and sequenced. Beside the dhfr-ts gene of 2.83 kb, four other genes were identified in a 7.41 kb region of  which at least three are expressed during the erythrocytic cycle. Three of the genes were highly conserved in closely related Theileria species and gene synteny was observed between B. bovis and T. parva. B. bovis merozoite cultures electroporated with plasmids containing T. gondii dhfr-tsm2m3 or human dhfr under control of B. bovis dhfr regions did not produce stable transfected parasites. Transient expression using GFP, YFP or ß-galactosidase as a reporter gene was also not yet established. Nevertheless, parasite cultures with decreased sensitivity for pyrimethamine and WR99210 were repeatly isolated. The dhfr gene of five resistant cultures was sequenced and showed to contain a S125F amino acid substitution. Homology modelling of B. bovis DHFR by using the P. falciparum DHFR structure as a template, suggested that S125F affects the binding site of NADPH. The five resistant cultures that were first selected on either pyrimethamine or WR99210 turned out to be cross-resistant for both drugs. Comparable drug sensitivities were only observed in a quadruple mutant of P. falciparum dhfr displaying strong resistance to pyrimethamine and 10-fold enhanced resistance against WR99210. Wildtype B. bovis was similar to this mutant at 3 of the 4 mutated positions possibly explaining its low sensitivity for pyrimethamine.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Portosystemic shunting occurs when anomalous veins allow the portal blood to enter the systemic veins directly without first flowing through the hepatic sinusoids. Portosystemic shunting can occur via acquired portosystemic collaterals or via congenital portosystemic shunts and may result in clinical signs of hepatic encephalopathy due to high blood ammonia levels.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is necessary to differentiate congenital portosystemic shunts non-invasively from other conditions that cause hyperammonemia, since congenital portosystemic shunts require surgical treatment while the other conditions do not. Portography, ultrasonography, scintigraphy, CT and MRI have been used to diagnose portal vein disorders. Although Doppler ultrasonography is the only technique that does not require the use of anesthesia, and can provide detailed anatomic and hemodynamic information about the abdominal vasculature, its accuracy in detecting congenital portosystemic shunts was reported to be insufficient.\\r\\nIn the present studies, gray scale ultrasonography with color Doppler mode appeared to be an accurate method to: diagnose a congenital portosystemic shunt, specify its type, distinguish it from acquired portosystemic collaterals and rule it out.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe definitive therapy for congenital portosystemic shunts would ideally be complete occlusion of the shunt. However, in most dogs, only partial shunt ligation can be performed because attenuating the shunt vessel results in post-ligation portal hypertension. Acute portal hypertension can usually be successfully avoided, though development of chronic portal hypertension remains a frequent complication.\\r\\nRegardless of the technique used for shunt attenuation and for assessing post-ligation portal hypertension, the clinical outcome remains unpredictable. This is largely because there is no method currently available to determine the optimal degree of shunt narrowing.\\r\\nAs a consequence of an exaggerated shunt closure, dogs may develop postoperative complications related to acute or chronic portal hypertension. To help avoid this problem, intraoperative ultrasonography greatly increases the likelihood of determining the optimal shunt diameter. Congenital extrahepatic portosystemic shunts do not have to, and actually should not, be completely occluded. Once the flow becomes hepatopetal in the entire portal vein and in the shunt adjacent to the portal vein, further narrowing of the shunt is unnecessary.\\r\\n\\r\\nComplete occlusion of a congenital extrahepatic portosystemic shunt has been suggested to result in a better clinical outcome compared to partial ligation. Several surgeons propose that a second surgery should be performed in every dog whose shunt has partially been attenuated in order to occlude their shunt completely.\\r\\nWe have shown that dogs that underwent a partial ligation of a congenital portosystemic shunt do not have to be routinely re-operated on. Color Doppler ultrasonography performed at least one month after surgical ligation of a shunt can reveal whether a persisting hyperammonemia is the result is of a functional shunt, acquired portosystemic collaterals, or both. Dogs that have developed acquired portosystemic collaterals and dogs, whose extrahepatic portosystemic shunt was partially ligated and the flow direction in the entire portal vein and in the shunt adjacent to the portal vein became hepatopetal should not be re-operated on.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Assessing and evaluating the health impact of environmental exposures'],\n",
       "  'Description': [\"Never in our Western-European history we have been as healthy as we are now. Until the 20th century the (physical) environment was the source of 70-80 percent of disease burden, nowadays, environmental factors probably contribute less than 5%, while life-style is responsible for the bulk of the current avoidable disease burden (around 25% of total). The impact of environmental exposures no longer predominantly involves clear mortality risks or loss of life expectancy, but comprises aspects of the quality of life in a broad sense as well: aggravation of pre-existing disease symptoms, social-psychological endpoints, such as severe annoyance, sleep disturbance, and unfavourable health perceptions and stress in relation to a poor quality of the local environment.\\nWe investigated an important instrument of collective health protection: risk assessment and management. We established that in principle any decent government should apply rights-based decision rules in environmental risk policy, guaranteeing every citizen an equal right to a certain level of protection or health care. However, we have also seen that purely right-based policies may go beyond the bounds of efficiency or affordability. To deal with risk as a 'social construct', as well as with equity versus efficiency trade-offs, we tentatively propose a typology of risk problems with matching procedures of increasing comprehensiveness, comprising 1) 'business as usual', traditional, quantitative analysis and management, 2) appropriate and proportional use of 'scarce resources', 3) a way out when 'calculations are simply not the issue', or 4) wisdom, when 'ignorance' is recognised in time. Procedures involve decision rules, goals, solutions, strategies (discourse) and instruments.\\nTo analyse environmental health impact in a more comparative manner, aggregating the divergent health effects associated with different types of environmental exposures, we explored the application of DALYs as some sort of 'public health currency'. The DALY is an aggregate indicator of disease burden (health loss). It integrates three important dimensions of public health, viz. life expectancy, quality of life, and number of people affected. Time is the unit of measurement: 'healthy life years' are either lost by premature death, or by loss of quality of life, measured as discounted life-years within a population.\\nUsing data from the Dutch National Environmental Outlook we estimated that the long-term effects of particulate air pollution appear to account for the greater part of the total environment related health loss in the Netherlands. Furthermore, the indoor environment appeared to be an important source of disease burden (radon, dampness, environmental tobacco smoke).\\nProvisional calculations of monetarised health loss due to environmental exposures indicate ample opportunities for cost efficient investments in environmental quality from the perspective of public health. We applied GDP per capita, WTP-estimates, and disease group specific costs of illness to roughly approach the monetary value of environment related mortality and morbidity, respectively. The credibility as well as the transparency of this type of analyses should be improved by means of systematic peer review and involvement of stakeholders in the definition of the framework for CEA and CBA.\"],\n",

       "  'Description': ['In this study, porcine embryos were produced in vitro from slaughterhouse sow or gilt oocytes which were matured and fertilized in vitro and subsequently cultured to the blastocyst stage.  In vitro produced blastocysts are of poorer quality than their in vivo counterparts, and suffer from a high incidence of embryo mortality during culture and foetal mortality after (non-) surgical transfer.  The causes of such abnormalities can possibly be ascribed to a number of factors such as the high incidence of polyspermy (oocyte penetration by more than one sperm cell), a reduced number of cells in transfer-stage blastocysts, deviant ratio of inner cell mass (cells giving rise to the foetus) to trophectoderm cells (cell layer developing into the placenta) and a higher incidence of programmed cell death (apoptosis).  This study demonstrated that the in vitro oocyte maturation milieu, is an important determinant of blastocysts quality.  Supplementation of oocyte maturation medium with sow follicular fluid, in contrast with gilt follicular fluid, reduced polyspermy and improved the morphological quality of resultant blastocysts, while modulation of hormone levels and addition of oviductal epithelial cells during in vitro oocyte maturation increased the total blastocyst cell number.  Supplementation of the embryo culture medium with growth hormone improved blastocyst quality by reducing DNA fragmentation (albeit that apoptosis in all was not decreased) and enhancing blastocyst expansion.  Growth hormone treatment did not improve pregnancy rates up to day 11 following non-surgical transfer, but all pregnancies resulted from batches of blastocysts which had a larger mean batch diameter.  In the final part of the study, blastocysts were selected for quality by evaluation of diameter and gross morphology.  Blastocysts of Class A quality showed enhanced survival after a novel culture-based test using cytochalasin-B, an actin cytoskeleton depolimerizing agent.  In contrast to Class B embryos, the ratio of inner cell mass to trophectoderm cells was normal in Class A embryos and also comparable with in vivo produced embryos.  These selection criteria lead to the first reported farrowing of 5 normal and healthy piglets following the non-surgical transfer of in vitro produced blastocysts.  The results obtained in this study forms the basis for future research which will focus on the application of embryonic stem cells derived from the inner cell mass of in vitro produced porcine blastocysts.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Allergic asthma is a disease which affects an increasing number of people. Patients with this illness suffer from variable airflow obstruction and increased airway responsiveness to a variety of stimuli. Furthermore, an inflammatory response in the lungs occurs, accompanied by enhanced mucus production (10). In serum of these patients enhanced levels of IgE antibodies can be detected (reviewed in 238, 239). Currently, several different drugs are available for people who suffer from asthma. These medicines include corticosteroids, b2-agonists, leukotriene antagonists and phosphodiesterase inhibitors (240-244). Corticosteroids are the most effective and most used drug at this moment in the treatment of asthma to reduce the inflammatory component and hyperresponsiveness (245). However, corticosteroids are not very selective and affect a whole range of inflammatory and non-inflammatory cells (246-248). More importantly, all drugs that are available for people who suffer from allergic asthma do not cure these patients but only reduce the clinical symptoms of this disorder. Therefore, current research is focused on development of strategies that treat asthmatics at a more causal level of their illness.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is now widely accepted that T-helper type 2 (Th2) lymphocytes play a causal role in allergic asthma (10, 249, 250). Th2 cells produce a limited set of cytokines including interleukin-3 (IL3), IL4, IL5, IL9, IL10 and IL13. Both in human asthmatic patients and murine models of allergic asthma Th2 subsets have been detected (8, 9) and it is extensively documented that the cytokines produced by these cells are crucial for development of allergic symptoms. New strategies could therefore be aimed at specifically targeting this T cell subset or the cytokines produced by these T cells (18, 251, 252).'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Picrorhiza scrophulariiflora, from traditional use to immunomodulatory activity'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Natural products have been an important resource for the maintenance of life for ages. Evaluation of traditionally used medicines, keeping into account the traditional principles that are applied in drug therapy, may supply leads towards effective\\n   drug discovery. This thesis deals with the pre-clinical evaluation of the immunomodulatory activity of Picrorhiza\\n   scrophulariiflora and the activity-guided isolation of active constituents, in order to assess its usefulness in rheumatoid arthritis\\n   or related conditions. Rhizomes of two Picrorhiza species happen to be available on South-Asian markets, e.g. P. kurrooa Royle\\n   and P. scrophulariiflora Pennell (Scrophulariaceae). Both species are known under the same local name, and used for similar\\n   purposes. However, an inventory of the geographical distribution of both Picrorhiza species provided sufficient information to\\n   establish the proper identity of the material under investigation as P. scrophulariiflora. Picrorhiza species are commonly used in\\n   Ayurveda, the traditional medicine of South Asia. The applicability of a plant for the treatment of a particular disease can be\\n   derived from generalized traditional principles, or obtained directly from traditional uses. Both approaches suggest that\\n   Picrorhiza might be useful in the prevention of amavata (rheumatoid arthritis). For the treatment of established amavata,\\n   however, it is not recommended, because it might enhance the joint damage. Review of the experimental literature on Picrorhiza\\n   species revealed the accumulation of cucurbitacin glucosides, iridoid glucosides, phenylethanoid glucosides, and\\n   acetophenone glucosides in the rhizomes of Picrorhiza species. These compounds have a wide range of biological activities,\\n   among which anti-inflammatory effects seem to prevail. The effects described relate to a protection of the liver against\\n   experimentally induced damage, the inhibition of pro-inflammatory responses, the interference with the formation of reactive\\n   oxygen species, and the enhancement of the physiological antioxidant system. The second part of the thesis describes\\n   experimental work on Soxhlet extracts of P. scrophulariiflora. The diethyl-ether Soxhlet extract was the most anti-inflammatory of\\n   all extracts prepared, concerning both nonspecific (complement and respiratory burst) and specific (T-cell proliferation) immune\\n   responses. Furthermore, prolonged administration of this extract showed inhibition of carrageenan-induced paw edema in mice.\\n   This effect is in line with the effects observed in vitro for this extract. Moderate inhibitory activity on the release of reactive\\n   oxygen species by activated neutrophils in vitro, was mainly attributed to apocynin. However, this compound did not show any\\n   anti-inflammatory effect in the acute inflammation model, suggesting that compounds other than apocynin are responsible for\\n   the anti-inflammatory effects observed. Collagen-induced arthritis in mice was used as a model to determine the effects of P.\\n   scrophulariiflora extracts on chronic inflammation. Treatment with the diethyl-ether extract or with apocynin reduced the\\n   incidence of arthritis, while other extracts tested were not active and none of the extracts affected the severity of arthritis. These\\n   results suggest that the inhibitory activity of the diethyl-ether extract can be attributed to apocynin. The in vivo effects were\\n   not associated with significant toxicity, as tested in mice by a semi-chronic assay involving body weight and weights of critical\\n   lymphoid organs. Activity-guided purification of the diethyl-ether extract revealed the presence of several compounds in the\\n   light petroleum and the diethyl ether extracts, which potently inhibit the classical pathway of complement. Part of these\\n   compounds might be phytosterols, while the nature of other active compounds has not yet been demonstrated. Guided by\\n   inhibitory activity in a mitogen-induced human T-lymphocyte proliferation assay, two cucurbitacins were isolated from the\\n   diethyl-ether extract: picracin and deacetylpicracin. Both compounds exhibited a potent inhibition of PHA-induced T-cell\\n   proliferation, which could not be ascribed to direct cytotoxic effects. Furthermore, incubation of activated T cells with picracin\\n   or deacetylpicracin for 24 h showed a marked inhibition of IL-2 release. However, flow-cytometric analysis showed a significant\\n   induction of apoptosis by picracin, while deacetylpicracin was not different from untreated cells. In addition, incubation of\\n   human monocytes with picracin for 24 h inhibited the release of IL-1b and TNFa, while deacetylpicracin was not active.\\n   Delayed-type hypersensitivity, a valuable model to demonstrate cell-mediated immune responses, was used to determine the\\n   effects of picracin and deacetylpicracin in vivo. Both picracin and deacetylpicracin significantly inhibited paw edema, at doses\\n   of 100 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg, respectively, after intraperitoneal administration. These effects, however, could not be enhanced by\\n   local, subcutaneous administration. Instead, an increased swelling was observed, and control experiments revealed a\\n   concentration-dependent direct inflammatory response. These effects might be related to the induction of T-cell apoptosis in\\n   vivo. The intraperitoneal administration of high doses of picracin or deacetylpicracin might induce a strong influx of leukocytes\\n   secondary to T-cell apoptosis. Leukocytes might as well be withheld from the paw, leaving behind a reduced number of\\n   inflammatory cells to elicit a local immune response after subcutaneous injection of antigen. In conclusion, several compounds\\n   play a role in immunomodulatory effects induced by Picrorhiza extracts. Picracin and deacetylpicracin induce a local immune\\n   response upon local administration, while they tend to decrease a local inflammatory response after systemic (i.p.)\\n   administration. Although the latter results are promising with regard to the anti-inflammatory activity of Picrorhiza, it cannot be\\n   excluded that these compounds enhance local inflammation and for example aggravate rheumatoid arthritis. Testing of picracin\\n   and deacetylpicracin in experimentally induced arthritis should be performed in order to evaluate such effects. Both compounds\\n   are present in the diethyl-ether extract, which decreased the onset of arthritis. However, apocynin was shown to exhibit similar\\n   effects, and is present in this extract as well, suggesting that it might be responsible for the effects observed for the\\n   diethyl-ether extract in collagen-induced arthritis. Neither the diethyl-ether extract, nor apocynin decreased the severity of joint\\n   inflammation in the dosages used. These findings are in agreement with the contraindication of Picrorhiza for the treatment of\\n   rheumatoid arthritis, according to both contemporary use and to Ayurvedic principles. However, the experimental results as\\n   well as the conclusions drawn from the Ayurvedic properties of Picrorhiza suggest that it can play an important role in the\\n   prevention of rheumatoid arthritis.'],\n",

       "  'Description': [\"Nerve growth factor (NGF) is known for years for its properties to induce neurite outgrowth. Its role in inflammation has recently been discovered. In this thesis the role of NGF in allergic asthma is shown. In chapter 2 we showed that NGF can\\n   induce airway hyperresponsiveness in guinea pigs. Simply injecting 8-80 ng NGF intravenously resulted in an airway\\n   hyperresponsiveness within 1 hr after administration. Sensory nerves in the aiwarys signal to the central nervous system. A\\n   subtype of these neurons express tachykinins, e.g. substance P and neurokinin A. Tachykinins can induce airway\\n   hyperresponsiveness. It seems NGF acts by sensitizing the sensory neurons. A neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist can prevent\\n   the induction of airway hyperresponsiveness by NGF. The neurokinin-1 receptor is the preferred receptor for the ligand\\n   substance P. In chapter 3 we show that NGF can sensitize the sensory nerve endings, and this either results in the release of\\n   more substance P or sensitization of the neurokinin-1 receptor, but does not involve an increased synthesis of substance P.\\n   Furthermore, cannabinoids can prevent the NGF-induced hyperresponsiveness in isolated tracheal ring as well as in the guinea\\n   pig in vivo. Cannabinoids induce an inhibitory signal in sensory neurons and thereby proof again that sensory nerve endings\\n   are involved in the induction of airway hyperresponsiveness by NGF. In a model for allergic asthma, using ovalbumin as an\\n   allergen, antibodies against NGF can prevent the acutely induced bronchoconstriction by inhalation of ovalbumin (chapter 4).\\n   This model for allergic asthma shows airway hyperresponsiveness as well, and this coincides with an increased content of\\n   tachykinins in the sensory neuronal cell bodies. In chapter 5 we show that this coincides with an increase in NGF in the airways\\n   as well. When the signal transduction pathway of the high affinity receptor for NGF, trkA, is blocked, the airway\\n   hyperresponsiveness can be prevented. Furthermore, the increase in substance P in the airways and neurons is prevented as\\n   well. Neurons as well as immune cells can release NGF. One of these cells is the mast cell. It has been suggested sensory\\n   neurons and mast cells interact. In chapter 6 we co-cultured bone marrow derived mast cells and dorsal root ganglion neurons\\n   to study whether these cells would affect each others function. The cells specifically adhered to each other. They only affect\\n   each other's function, though this seems not to be of any significant physiological importance. Concluding, NGF affects airway\\n   function by affecting sensory nerve function. This thesis shows NGF is involved in the development of airway pathology in a\\n   model for allergic asthma. This could lead to the development of a new class of therapeutics against allergic asthma.\"],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Introduction\\nIfosfamide is an alkylating agent, which is used in the treatment of various types of malignant\\ndiseases in adults and childeren. Its use, however, can be accompanied by severe\\nhaematological, neuro- and nephrotoxicities. Since its development in the middle of the\\n1960\\x92s, most of its extensive metabolism has been elucidated. Ifosfamide is a prodrug, which\\nneeds to undergo activation by cytochrome P450-3A4 (CYP3A4) to 4-hydroxyifosfamide.\\nIntracellular spontaneous decomposition of 4-hydroxyifosfamide yields the ultimate alkylating\\nmetabolite ifosforamide mustard. Ifosforamide mustard binds to DNA causing cross-links\\nfollowed by apoptosis. Ifosfamide is deactivated to the non-cytotoxic metabolites 2- and 3-dechloroethylifosfamide,\\nyielding an equimolar amount of neurotoxic chloroacetaldehyde.\\nIfosfamide metabolism is autoinducible. In chapter 1 a review of the literature is given\\naddressing key issues in the clinical pharmacology of ifosfamide and its metabolites.\\nUnderstanding the relationship between plasma concentrations (pharmacokinetics) and effect\\n(pharmacodynamics) is important for the rational development and the safe and effective use\\nof every therapeutic agent. Since the efficacy and specific toxicities of the treatment with\\nifosfamide may be linked to its extensive metabolism, pharmacokinetic assessment of\\nifosfamide and its metabolites is of special interest in helping to explain the unpredictable\\nchances of success and failure in ifosfamide treatment. To characterize the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic\\nrelationships and their variability adequately, studies in a representative\\npopulation using a relatively large number of patients, are needed. However, for practical and\\nethical reasons extensive pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies in a large number\\nof often critically ill patients are not possible. Therefore, there was a need for an approach\\nwith the help of which description of the relevant pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic\\nrelationships and of their variability is possible on the basis of sparse data (few data-points\\nper patient) collected under unbalanced designs. Such a population approach will also allow\\ntherapeutic drug monitoring of ifosfamide, which can help in further tailoring ifosfamide\\ntreatment to the specific needs of the individual patient.\\nThe aims of the research described in this thesis were to develop bioanalytical methods for\\ndetermination of ifosfamide and its metabolites, to build population pharmacokinetic models\\nfor these compounds and to apply thee techniques in various clinical studies on ifosfamide.\\nBioanalysis of ifosfamide and metabolites\\nAssessment of the pharmacokinetics of ifosfamide and metabolites has long been impaired\\nby the lack of reliable bioanalytical assays. The availability of high through-put bioanalytical\\nmethods for all relevant metabolites of ifosfamide is a prerequisite for the pharmacological\\nevaluation of the drug in cancer patients. In chapter 2 several new analytical methods are\\ndescribed for the determination of ifosfamide and its main metabolites. Gas chromatography\\nwas used to determine ifosfamide and its deactivated metabolites (chapter 2.1). Knowledge\\nof the pharmacokinetics of the deactivated metabolites 2- and 3-dechloroethylifosfamide is\\ncrucial for insight into the risk of central neurotoxicity during ifosfamide treatment. In a comparison between nitrogen-phosphorous detection and positive ion electron-impact ion-trap\\nmass spectrometry, the former proved to be superior in sensitivity, accuracy and\\nprecision. The main activated metabolites 4-hydroxyifosfamide (chapter 2.2) and\\nifosforamide mustard (chapter 2.3) were determined using two high-performance liquid\\nchromatography assays. The limitation of the highly unstable character of these metabolites\\nwas addressed by derivatization creating stabile, UV-absorbing derivatives. All analytical\\nmethods proved to be specific, sensitive, accurate and precise, and could be employed in the\\nanalysis of patient samples in a hospital setting.\\nThe choice of the matrix for the pharmacokinetic assessment might be of importance, as\\nliterature previously indicated possible differences in metabolite distribution between plasma\\nand erythrocytes. Consequently, drug concentration-time profiles in whole blood and plasma\\ncould differ, thereby yielding different values for the pharmacokinetic parameters. These data\\nled us to investigate the in vitro and in vivo distribution of ifosfamide and its metabolites.\\nThese studies indicated that ifosfamide and its metabolites rapidly reach distribution\\nequilibrium between erythrocytes and plasma, with ifosforamide mustard being the slowest\\n(chapter 2.4). A strong parallelism in the erythrocyte and plasma concentration profiles was\\nobserved for all compounds, which indicates that no differences will arise in the assessment\\nof pharmacokinetic parameters using either matrix. Thus, pharmacokinetic assessment using\\nonly plasma sampling can yield direct, accurate and relevant relationships with efficacy and\\ntoxicity of ifosfamide treated patients.\\nDevelopment of population pharmacokinetic models\\nThe development of improved bioanalytical assays allowed extensive pharmacokinetic\\nassessment of ifosfamide and its metabolites. Pharmacokinetic assessment can identify key\\nissues like population differences in pharmacokinetic parameters and the influence of dose\\nand schedule of administration. A review of clinical pharmacokinetic studies on ifosfamide\\ndemonstrates that in most studies autoinduction has been observed (chapter 1). Although the\\nmechanism of autoinduction is currently not completely understood, this phenomenon needed\\nto be taken into account when establishing a pharmacokinetic model for ifosfamide and its\\nmetabolites. Development of these models was accelerated by using rich data populations.\\nIn a population of 15 patients with soft tissue sarcoma who received a 72-hour continuous\\ninfusion of ifosfamide, a non-linear population pharmacokinetic model was developed using\\nnon-linear mixed effect modelling (NONMEM). This model allowed quantification of the effect\\nof autoinduction on the concentration-time profiles of ifosfamide with correlations between the\\nifosfamide plasma concentrations and the extent of the autoinduction (chapter 3.1).\\nIn order to determine whether this population pharmacokinetic model was adequate in\\ndescribing the pharmacokinetics of ifosfamide, a comparison was made with two other\\nstructural models: one without autoinduction and one with a time-dependent development of\\nautoinduction of ifosfamide (chapter 3.2). The comparison was made in a population of 14\\npatients with small cell lung cancer who received a 1-hour intravenous infusion of ifosfamide\\ndaily for one or two days in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin. Again, the model\\npresented in chapter 3.1 described the concentration-time profiles of ifosfamide best. The\\nBayesian estimates of the pharmacokinetic parameters were used to describe the pharmacokinetics of 2- and 3-dechloroethylifosfamide and 4-hydroxyifosfamide. Dose-fractionation\\nover two days compared to one day resulted in increased metabolite formation,\\nespecially for 2-dechloroethylifosfamide, probably due to increased autoinduction.\\nThis effect of schedule was investigated further in a population pharmacokinetic study of all\\nquantifiable analytes (chapter 2) in 56 patients, who were divided in three groups according to\\nthe length of ifosfamide infusion (chapter 3.3). The rate by which the autoinduction developed\\nand the fractions metabolized to 2- and 3-dechloroethyl-ifosfamide were found to be\\nsignificantly dependent on the infusion schedule. The observed differences in the parameters\\nwere, however, comparable to their interindividual variability and were, therefore, considered\\nto be of minor clinical importance. Autoinduction caused a less than proportional increase in\\nthe area under the ifosfamide plasma concentration-time curve (measurement of exposure)\\nand more than proportional increase in metabolite exposure with increasing ifosfamide dose.\\nThis study demonstrated that the duration of ifosfamide infusion influences the exposure to\\nthe parent and its metabolite 3-dechloroethylifosfamide. The observed dose and infusion\\nduration dependency should be taken into account when the pharmacodynamics of different\\ninfusion schedules are evaluated.\\nClinical applications\\nThe developed pharmacokinetic population models (chapter 3) were valuable tools in the\\ndetermination of the pharmacokinetic profiles of ifosfamide and its metabolites in various\\nclinical studies on ifosfamide (chapter 4). Responses to ifosfamide treatment and toxicities\\nvary to a great degree among patients. This variability might be explained by differences in\\npharmacokinetics. Characterising covariates which contribute to the variation in the\\npharmacokinetics is therefore of paramount importance. Therefore, the pharmacokinetics,\\nrelations between the pharmacokinetics and covariates and pharmacodynamics of ifosfamide\\nand 2- and 3-dechloroethylifosfamide and 4-hydroxyifosfamide were assessed in a population\\nof 20 patients with soft tissue sarcoma, who received ifosfamide administered as a 72-hour\\ncontinuous intravenous infusion (chapter 4.1). The population pharmacokinetic model\\n(according to chapter 3.1) was built in a sequential manner, starting with a covariate-free\\nmodel and progressing to a covariate model with the aid of generalized additive modelling.\\nThe addition of the covariates weight, body surface area, albumin, serum creatinine, serum\\nurea, alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase improved the prediction errors of the\\nmodel. Significant pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships were observed between\\nthe exposure to 2- and 3-dechloroethylifosfamide and orientational disorder, a neurotoxic side-effect.\\nNo pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships between exposure to 4-hydroxyifosfamide\\nand haematological toxicities could be observed in this population.\\nChildren are a special population within the field of oncology. Only limited information is\\navailable on the pharmacokinetics of ifosfamide and its metabolites in paediatric patients, due\\nto the ethical problems involved in these studies. We assessed the feasibility of a sparse data\\napproach for the determination of the population pharmacokinetics of ifosfamide, 2- and 3-dechloroethylifosfamide\\nand 4-hydroxyifosfamide in 32 children treated with various\\nschedules of single agent ifosfamide therapy against various malignant tumours (chapter\\n4.2). A non-linear population pharmacokinetic model with linear development of autoinduction was implemented. In chapter 3.2 this model proved less accurate in the description of the\\nifosfamide concentration-time profiles than the model presented in chapters 3.1 and 3.3.\\nHowever, the more elaborate ifosfamide concentration dependent autoinduction model could\\nnot be applied in this sparse data population. Cross-validation by bootstrapping the data\\nindicated accurate description of the population pharmacokinetic parameter without bias.\\nSpecific isoenzymes are responsible for ifosfamide metabolism; activation is mediated by\\nCYP3A4 and deactivation by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6. Therefore, modulation of the metabolism\\nof ifosfamide may lead to an improved efficacy/toxicity ratio. Modulation was investigated by\\nco-administrating ketoconazole and rifampicin, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 and inducer of\\nCYP3A4/2B6, respectively (chapter 4.3). In a double randomized, two-way cross-over study a\\ntotal of 16 patients received ifosfamide either alone or in combination with ketoconazole or\\nrifampicin. Pharmacokinetics were assessed using the models developed in chapter 3.\\nRifampicin increased metabolism of ifosfamide without specifically favouring the activation or\\ndeactivation route of ifosfamide. Ketoconazole decreased activation to 4-hydroxyifosfamide.\\nThus, disappointingly this pharmacokinetic study indicated that no therapeutic benefit may be\\ngained by modulation of ifosfamide therapy with rifampicin or ketoconazole in humans.\\nCommonly, chemotherapeutic agents are applied in combination-schedules in order to\\nmaximize the efficacy. The novel combination of ifosfamide and the topoisomerase I inhibitor\\ntopotecan was investigated in a phase I trial (chapter 4.4). Preliminary results indicate that the\\ncombination of topotecan administered as a 30-minute infusion daily times 3 with ifosfamide\\nadministered as a 1-hour infusion daily times 3 every three weeks to patients with advanced\\nmalignancies was feasible. Haematological toxicities were dose limiting. The maximum\\ntolerated dose of topotecan has not yet been reached. The pharmacokinetics of topotecan\\nand ifosfamide and its metabolites were similar to those observed after single agent\\nadministration suggesting that the drugs did not interact pharmacokinetically. Sigmoidal Emax\\nmodels could be fit to the relationship between the areas under the plasma concentration-time\\ncurve of topotecan lactone and total topotecan, and the decrease in absolute neutrophil\\ncount. Partial responses were documented in three patients with ovarian cancer. Possible\\nclinical benefit of this combination needs to be evaluated in phase II/III studies.\\nPerspectives and final remarks\\nAlthough ifosfamide has successfully been used for over 30 years in the treatment of various\\nmalignant diseases, there is still a need for understanding its variability in success and failure\\nof treatment. Now that satisfactory bioanalytical methods and population pharmacokinetic\\nmodels have been developed, the underlying mechanisms of this varibility may be better\\nunderstood and a superior ifosfamide therapy may be developed, tailored to dosing-requirements\\nof the individual patient. Furthermore, as individuals differ from each other in\\ntheir concentration-effect relationships, the implication of schedule dependence is that varying\\nthe administration pattern, for example the infusion duration, between individuals may prove to\\nbe as important as individualising the dose-size of ifosfamide.\\nOne of the remaining issues in the clinical pharmacology of ifosfamide is the firm\\nestablishment of pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships that provide enough\\ninformation for precise predictions of the clinical outcome of therapy based on the pharmacokinetics of ifosfamide. Only if this requirement is met the further development of\\ntherapeutic drug monitoring and dose individualization of ifosfamide treatment will be possible.\\nThis thesis is the first step in that direction, but many more pieces of the puzzle need to be\\nput together to achieve complete understanding of the extent and limitations of the clinical\\nactivity and toxicity of ifosfamide therapy.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Structure-based drug design is made possible by our understanding of molecular recognition.\\nThe utility of this approach was apparent in the development of the clinically e V ective HIV-1\\nPR inhibitors, where crystal structures of complexes of HIV-1 protease and inhibitors gave\\npivotal information. Computational methods drawing upon structural data are of increasing\\nrelevance to the drug design process. Nonetheless, these methods are quite rudimentary and\\nsignicant improvements are needed. The aim of this thesis was to investigate techniques\\nwhich may lead to improved modelling of molecular recognition and a better ability to make\\npredictions about the binding a Y nity of ligands. The two main themes were the modelling\\nof acid\\x96base titration behaviour of ligand and receptor, and the application of the simulation\\ntechnique of congurational bias Monte Carlo (CBMC). The studies were performed with\\nHIV-1 PR and its inhibitors as a model system.\\nBiological processes are inuenced by the pH of the medium in which they take place.\\nLigand\\x96receptor binding equilibria are often thermodynamically linked to protonation changes\\nin ligand and/or receptor, as seen in the the binding of a number of HIV-1 PR inhibitors.\\nIn Chapter 2, a series of sixteen continuum electrostatics pKa calculations of HIV-1 PR\\x96\\ninhibitor complexes was done, in order to characterize the nature and size of these linkages.\\nThe most important e V ects concern changes in the pKa of the enzyme active site aspartate\\ndyad. Large pKa shifts were predicted in all cases, and at least one of the two dyad pKas\\nbecame more basic on binding. At physiologically relevant pH, di V erent ligands induced\\ndi V erent protonation states, with di V erent tautomeric forms favoured. The fully deprotonated\\nform of the dyad was not signicantly populated for any of the complexes. For about a third\\nof the complexes, both singly and doubly protonated forms were predicted to be populated.\\nThe predicted predominant protonation states of MVT-101 and VX-478 were consistent with\\nprevious theoretical studies. The size of the predicted pKa shifts for MVT-101 and XK263\\ndi V ered from a previous study using similar methods. The paucity and ambiguity of available\\nexperimental data makes it di Y cult to evaluate the results fully; however the tendency to\\nexaggerate shifts, as observed in other studies, appears to be present.\\n\\x93Scoring\\x94 is the prediction of binding a Y nity from the structure of the ligand\\x96receptor\\ncomplex, according to an empirical scheme. Scoring studies usually neglect or grossly simplify\\nthe contribution of protonation equilibria to a Y nity, so in Chapter 3 proton linkage data was\\nincluded in a regression analysis of the HIV-1 PR complexes from Chapter 2. Parameters\\npreviously shown to correlate with binding, namely electrostatic free energy changes and\\nburied surface areas, were the basis for the analysis, and terms describing proton linkage,\\nin the form of a correction for assay pH and an indicator variable for predicted dyad pKa\\nshift on binding, were also considered. The complex with MVT-101 was an outlier in the\\nanalysis and was excluded. Further analysis demonstrated that the correction for assay pH made a signicant contribution to the regression equation. Amendment of the parameters\\nfor XK263 according to the available experimental data led to an improved regression in\\nwhich the term for calculated pKa shifts also made a signicant contribution. The regression\\nequations obtained had the same form and similar coe Y cients to scoring functions of the\\n\\x93master equation\\x94 type, and t the experimental data with comparable accuracy.\\nMore physically realistic simulations of ligand\\x96receptor binding using the techniques of\\nmolecular dynamics (MD) or Monte Carlo (MC) are potentially more accurate than scoring\\nfunction approaches. These methods are slow, so the alternative of CBMC, which has been\\nshown to give faster convergence for polymer simulations, was implemented for C harmm 22,\\nan all-atom protein force eld (Chapter 4). The correctness of the implementation was\\ndemonstrated by comparison with exact and stochastic dynamics (SD) results for individual\\nterms in the force eld. The algorithm is more complex than those typically used with alkane\\nforce elds, and this has possible consequences for the e Y ciency. CBMC was used to generate\\na Ramachandran plot for the alanine dipeptide, and the results were found to be in agreement\\nwith those generated by a SD simulation. Analysis of statistical errors suggests that CBMC\\nshould be competitive with umbrella sampling for simulating conformational equilibria, par-\\nticularly when the cost of non-bonded energy evaluations dominates the simulation.\\nCBMC can be applied to ligand\\x96receptor binding, as demonstrated in grand canonical\\nsimulations of alkane adsorption in zeolites. The more limited problem of nding the pre-\\ndominant bound conformation of a exible ligand given a rigid protein receptor (i.e. \\x93dock-\\ning\\x94) was treated in Chapter 5, using the example of a tripeptide inhibitor which binds to\\nHIV-1 PR. Attempts to perform the docking using the Metropolis MC/simulated annealing\\nand Lamarckian genetic algorithm methods implemented in the program AutoDock failed\\nto reproduce the native conguration (with runs on the order of two days execution time).\\nDocking using CBMC, combined with parallel tempering to further improve sampling, was\\nsuccessful in nding the native binding mode, although this success was dependent on ad hoc\\nadjustments to the force eld, and a priori knowledge of the ligand protonation state and bind-\\ning site. The e Y ciency of the method was considerably lower than hoped, with problems\\ndue to the force eld- and model-dependent coupling between terms in the potential energy\\nfunction, and the \\x93greedy\\x94 nature of the CBMC algorithm.\\nVarious conclusions can be drawn from these studies. Chapters 2 and 3 provide evidence\\nof the importance of protonation equilibria in ligand\\x96protein molecular recognition, and un-\\nderline the sizable contribution of electrostatic interactions to binding energies. In the face of\\nthis nding, neglect of electrostatic terms, as often seen past studies, appears to be counterpro-\\nductive. The scoring study also shows how experimental data can be used more e V ectively if\\nfactors such as assay conditions are carefully taken into account. Implementation of CBMC for\\na widely-used protein force eld and application of the algorithm to docking (Chapters 4 and\\n5) represents a proof of concept for a broadly useful simulation technique. Further work will\\nbe required to nd the right niche for CBMC and fully explore the potential of this and re-\\nlated techniques. A nal point is the demonstrated utility of the HIV-1 PR test system which\\nformed the focus of the studies. Abundant structural data has enabled many new approaches\\nto be tested, and further insights are expected from the analysis of unusual cases, such as the\\nanomalous results for MVT-101. As well as the question of scoring, studies of mutation and\\nresistance are likely to attract considerable interest in the future.'],\n",

An\\n      increasing number of guidelines are being developed to translate new evidence to\\n      medical practice. The implementation of guidelines, however, is a complex process.\\n      This thesis compares two methods of continuing medical education (CME).\\n      Reimbursement data were used to provide quantitative information to support the\\n      methods. We used the regionally organized, typically Dutch, peer review groups\\n      (PRGs) of primary care physicians and pharmacists to address professionals. In\\n      addition we included patient outcome measures to evaluate the effect of our program\\n      patients' well being. Chapter 1 describes the state of the art in the diffusion of\\n      innovations, the use of reimbursement data for research, and how to define -and how\\n      measure- the quality of prescribing and how to measure patient outcomes. Chapter 2\\n      is about the assessment of the quality and suitability of our data. We describe a\\n      systematic tool to test the appropriateness of a given database for specific research\\n      questions. It gives insight into data collecting and data quality, relevant for both\\n      researchers and readers. We describe in particular the potency and the pitfalls of\\n      reimbursement data and express our belief that these data need to be protected and\\n      valued more. Chapter 3 describes how we used reimbursement data to assess the\\n      quality of prescribing. Chapter 4 compares the prevalence of complaints mentioned\\n      by users of anticholinergic antidepressants to a control group of former users in a\\n      population of ambulant elderly. In Chapter 5 we compared several rating scales to\\n      assess depression, since inclusion criteria are an essential element of good guidelines.\\n      Chapter 6 describes qualities of the PRGs in the area. We selected and evaluated\\n      characteristics of PRGs that were thought to be relevant for the effect of our outreach\\n      program. Chapter 7 describes the intervention we undertook to reduce the\\n      prescribing of highly anticholinergic antidepressants in the elderly and its effect on\\n      incident prescribing. The intervention was designed following insights usually\\n      referred to as academic detailing. We added a group versus individual approach\\n      design. Addressing groups may be an important tool to support acceptance of new\\n      guidelines. More research in group-learning processes is needed to improve our\\n      understanding of CME. Chapter 8 compares the questionnaires of users, living in the\\n      intervention and control areas. Chapter 9 includes some final considerations, in\\n      which we speculate on what CME might look like in the future. What will be the role\\n      of very large medical databases in diffusion of innovations, quality assessment and\\n      improvement? What actually is to be defined as optimal prescribing? How do we\\n      maintain large medical databases without jeopardizing privacy?

This strategy involves targeting of immunoliposomes to specific receptors on tumor cells that result in receptor-mediated uptake of the immunoliposomes. Escape of immunoliposome-entrapped biotherapeutics from within the endocytic compartment was realized by incorporating either influenza virus hemagglutinin proteins or synthetic dimeric fusion peptides resembling the fusion peptide domain of influenza virus HA into the immunoliposomes/virosomes. These molecules have membrane destabilizing and fusion activity at low pH allowing passage of liposome-entrapped drug over the endosomal membrane into the cytosol.Via the same cellular uptake route cationic polymer-condensed DNA could be specifically delivered into ovarian carcinoma cells by encapsulating polyplexes into antibody-targeted liposomes. The results demonstrate in vitro that liposomal delivery of biotherapeutics into the cytosol of target cells via the route of receptor-mediated endocytosis and subsequent endosomal escape is feasible and provide exciting new avenues to be explored in the future.'],\n",

For the taxanes paclitaxel and docetaxel, however, low oral bioavailability has limited development of treatment by the oral route. Preclinical studies with mdr1a P-glycoprotein knock-out mice, which lack functional P-glycoprotein activity in the gut, have shown significant bioavailability of orally administered paclitaxel. Additional studies in wild-type mice revealed good bioavailability after oral administration when paclitaxel was combined with Pglycoprotein blockers such as cyclosporin A or the structurally related compound SDZ PSC 833. Based on the extensive preclinical research, the feasibility of oral administration of paclitaxel and docetaxel in cancer patients was recently demonstrated in our Institute. Co-administration of cyclosporin A strongly enhanced the oral bioavailability of both paclitaxel and docetaxel. For docetaxel in combination with cyclosporin A an oral bioavailability of 90% was achieved with an interpatient variability similar to that after intravenous drug administration; for paclitaxel the oral bioavailability is estimated at approximately 50%.

       "  'Title': ['Eotaxin, airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Eotaxin is a chemokine involved in migration and activation of inflammatory cells. CC-chemokine receptor-3 (CCR3), the receptor for eotaxin and other chemokines, is expressed by a variety of cells, such as eosinophils, Th2 cells, basophils and mast cells. These different cell types play an important role in the pathophysiology of asthma. Two characteristic features of asthma are airway inflammation, which mainly consists of increased number of eosinophils in the airway, and airway hyperresponsiveness.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis thesis aimed to assess whether eotaxin is involved in the development of airway hyperresponsiveness, either directly or indirectly via inducing eosinophil trafficking. It was investigated in three different ways.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, it was examined whether eotaxin instillation into the airways induced airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness. In mice eotaxin instillation into the airways did not result in increased number of eosinophils in the airways, nor did it change airway responsiveness. In contrast, eotaxin inhalation by human asthmatic volunteers resulted in a small increase in sputum eosinophils compared to placebo treatment. No changes in airway responsiveness could be measured. This might indicate that only eotaxin induced eosinophil migration under inflammatory circumstances but is not involved in the development of airway hyperresponsiveness.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond, it was assessed whether eotaxin played a role in ovalbumin-/virus-induced airway hyperresponsiveness. Intratracheal administration of parainfluenza-3 virus to guinea pigs resulted in increased levels of eotaxin in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. This coincided with increased numbers of eosinophils in the BAL fluid. In a murine model for allergic asthma, ovalbumin treatment lead to airway hyperresponsiveness, airway inflammation and increased eotaxin levels in BAL fluid. However, treatment of ovalbumin challenged and sensitised mice with anti-eotaxin antibodies did not change the number of eosinophils in the BAL fluid and airway responsiveness. Thus, although eotaxin is increasingly expressed after a respiratory virus infection or ovalbumin treatment, it seems that eotaxin is not the only factor involved in eosinophil migration.\\r\\n\\r\\nThird, it was investigated whether eotaxin can activate mast cells. Using flowcytometry it was assessed that bone-marrow-derived mast cells express CCR3 on their surface. However, activation of this receptor by eotaxin did not influence mast cell activation. No mast cell degranulation and leukotriene C4 production could be demonstrated. Therefore, it seems unlikely that eotaxin augment inflammatory reactions by activating mast cells.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion, eotaxin alone is not responsible for increased migration of eosinophils to the airways. Only in allergic conditions, such as in asthmatic patients, eotaxin may be involved in eosinophil migration. Since anti-eotaxin antibodies did not reduce airway eosinophilia in ovalbumin treated mice, it is unlikely that eotaxin or its receptor will be a good candidate as a therapeutic target.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Asthma is characterized by a chronic inflammatory reaction in the airways. Roughly, asthma can be subdivided into atopic asthma involving elevated levels of serum IgE and a less familiar form, non-atopic asthma. Non-atopic asthma is an increasing problem in the developed world. The mechanisms involved in the induction and on-going respiratory impairments associated with non-atopic asthma are unknown and poorly investigated. In the present thesis the involvement of mast cells and nerves in asthma were studied in vitro using primary cultured mast cells and neurons and in vivo, in a murine model for non-atopic asthma. Non-atopic asthma was induced in mice by skin-sensitization with the low molecular weight compound dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB) followed by intranasal intra-airway challenge with a water-soluble dinitrobenzene derivate, dinitrobenzene sulphonic acid (DNS). Features of this pulmonary reaction included acute bronchoconstriction and mast cell activation shortly after challenge, and tracheal hyperreactivity, mononuclear and neutrophilic cell infiltration and an increase in mucosal exudation in the alveolar lumen 24 to 48 h after challenge. This hypersensitivity reaction was not associated with an increase in hapten specific IgE. The role of the mast cell was established by studying responses in genetically mast cell-deficient and congenic normal mice. Mast cell-deficient strains failed to show any features of the hypersensitivity response. Mast cell reconstitution restored the acute bronchoconstriction, tracheal vascular hyperpermeability, BAL neutrophilia and tracheal hyperreactivity observed after DNFB sensitization and intranasal DNS challenge. These findings clearly demonstrate a key role for mast cells in the regulation of pulmonary hypersensitivity responses associated with non-atopic asthma. TNF-alfa is a multifunctional proinflammatory cytokine that is produced and released by mast cells. An important role for this mast cell mediator in pulmonary hypersensitivity reactions is demonstrated in chapters 5 and 6. Intra-airway application of TNF-alfa to non-treated mice resulted in the infiltration of a significant number of neutrophils (chapter 6). Furthermore, neutrophil infiltration and tracheal hyperreactivity induced by DNFB sensitization are both strongly reduced by neutralizing anti-TNF-alfa antibodies (chapter 5). Sensory nerves in the airways signal to the central nervous system. A subtype of these neurons express tachykinins such as substance P. The neurokinin-1 receptor is the preferred receptor for the ligand substance P. In the employed model for non-atopic asthma, blockade of the NK-1 receptor with a specific antagonist or the genetic absence of the NK-1 receptor prevented the development of tracheal hyperreactivity and cellular (neutrophil) accumulation in the mouse airways (chapter 2). Furthermore, it is shown that intra-airway application of substance P in non-treated mice results in the development of tracheal hyperreactivity (chapter 6). In vitro, substance P is able to activate mast cells. It is demonstrated that NK-1 receptors are significantly expressed on mast cells shortly co-cultured with IL-4 and/or SCF in contrast to nontreated mast cells that barely express NK-1 receptors (chapter 7). The increase in NK-1 receptor expression induced by IL-4 and SCF is time dependent. The number of positive cells increases with the length of co-culture although a plateau level is reached. To directly link substance P release to mast cell activation, the direct communication of BMMC and neurite-sprouting SCG was examined. It is shown that mast cell activation can occur as a direct response to the possible release of substance P from neurites (chapter 8).'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Summary \\n\\x93The role of T-cell co-stimulatory molecules in murine models of allergic asthma.\\x94 \\n\\nAllergen-specific T helper type 2 (Th2) cells play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis and progression of allergic asthma by orchestrating the inflammatory response. For optimal activation, T-cells require nonspecific co-stimulatory signals in addition to the antigen-specific signal conferred by the T-cell receptor. In this thesis, the role and therapeutic potential of blockade of T-cell co-stimulation in ovalbumin (OVA)-induced murine models of allergic asthma were investigated.\\n\\nThe main co-stimulatory receptor on T-cells is CD28. Two ligands are available for this receptor: B7-1 and B7-2. The second receptor for the B7 ligands, CTLA4, is expressed on activated T-cells and delivers an inhibitory signal to terminate the immune response. The existence of a third B7-1/B7-2 receptor was postulated in a recent study using a novel mouse strain lacking both CD28 and CTLA4 (CD28/CTLA4?/?). However, no manifestations of allergic asthma could be induced by OVA in both CD28/CTLA4?/? and B7-1/B7-2?/? mice. So, whereas T-cell co-stimulation via the putative B7-1/B7-2 receptor appears to play no role in the development of asthma manifestations in this murine model, CD28 signaling is critical.\\nHowever, asthma patients start therapy after the development of airway symptoms while exposure to environmental allergen mostly continues. Therefore, it was investigated if blockade of CD28 can reverse established manifestations of allergic asthma in mice after the development of these manifestations while OVA exposures are continued (\\x93ongoing\\x94 murine model of allergic asthma) (chapter 3). Blockade of CD28 substantially inhibited the established antigen-induced airway manifestations in mice. In a more \\x93severe\\x94 ongoing model induced by a different OVA sensitization- and challenge protocol, the effects of CD28 blockade on established asthma manifestations were less pronounced. \\nThe recently discovered, CD28-family member, inducible T-cell co-stimulator (ICOS) has been suggested to play a more prominent role in the effector phase rather than in the initiation of the Th2-dominated allergic inflammatory response. However, blockade of ICOS appeared to have no effect on any of the established manifestations in the \\x93ongoing\\x94 murine model of allergic asthma whereas blockade during the development of these manifestations was much less effective compared with blockade of CD28 (chapter 4).\\nBlockade of T-cell co-stimulation has been shown not only to result in the immediate suppression of the immune response but to induce in some disease models long-term antigen-specific unresponsiveness (tolerance) as well. Short-lived treatment that induces selective tolerance to the inhalant allergen would be a very attractive therapeutic approach for allergic asthma. Therefore, it was investigated if blockade of T-cell co-stimulation during the development of asthma manifestations also had an effect after serum clearance when mice were re-challenged with OVA (chapter 5). Blockade of the CD28:B7 pathway -but not of the CD40 ligand:CD40 pathway (another well-known pathway of T-cell co-stimulation)- could induce tolerance for some asthma manifestations re-induced by OVA re-challenge.\\n\\nSo, these pre-clinical studies indicate that blockade of T-cell co-stimulation, especially the CD28:B7 interaction, may be an alternative therapy for both asthma patients in clinical remission and those with ongoing disease. The latter group possibly requiring additional therapy.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['In this thesis, the effects of the two calcium -like peptides CALP1 and CALP2 on several\\r\\ncell types involved in asthma are examined. Furthermore, we tested the effects of these\\r\\npeptides in a guinea pig model for allergic asthma.\\r\\nCalcium is a key secondary messenger, whose function is tightly regulated by the\\r\\ncalcium-sensing regulatory protein calmodulin (CaM). CALPs are peptides which\\r\\nspecifically bind to the calcium -binding sites, the EF-hands, of CaM. Specific modulation\\r\\nof calcium and/or CaM-regulated processes provides insights into processes such as\\r\\ncell signalling.

       "  'Description': ['Weibel-Palade bodies are specialized secretory granules found in endothelial cells. These vesicles are able to store a variety of proteins with different biological functions such as the multimeric glycoprotein  von Willebrand factor (VWF) that is required for normal haemostasis, the leukocyte adhesion receptor P-selectin, and the chemokine interleukin-8 (IL-8). Correct delivery of these proteins to the cell membrane or to the circulation is essential for the biological role of these proteins. Indeed, regulated exocytosis of Weibel-Palade bodies serves several physiological functions including inflammatory and haemostatic responses. However, the mechanisms such as sorting of proteins to Weibel-Palade bodies, Weibel-Palade body trafficking in the cell and secretion of their content into the circulation, are far of being understood. In this thesis, I tried to get more insight into the life cycle of Weibel-Palade bodies and the extracellular function of one of their constituents.\\r\\nThe first step of the life cycle of Weibel-Palade bodies is the sorting process of proteins into these storage organelles. Chapter 2 indicates that VWF plays an active role in sequestering IL-8 into Weibel-Palade bodies.\\r\\nChapter 3 describes the existence of  different pools of Weibel-Palade bodies: some vesicles barely moved as if they were tethered, others seemed to travel in a stochastic manner. Upon arrival at the plasma membrane, tethered Weibel-Palade bodies are trapped in the actin cortex of endothelial cells awaiting a trigger for release. Upon stimulation of endothelial cells, either with Ca2+- or cAMP-raising agonists, we observed fusion of individual vesicles with the plasma membrane, gradual release and diffusion of Weibel-Palade body content into the extracellular compartment. As a result of slow exocytosis, endothelial cells may present at their surface focal sites with high concentrations VWF, IL-8 and P-selectin which, in turn, may play a role in focal adhesion of blood constituents to the endothelium upon vascular injury. In addition to exocytosis, cAMP-raising agonists induce clustering of a subset of Weibel-Palade bodies in the perinuclear region of the cell. This may be a mechanism to prevent excessive exocytosis of Weibel-Palade bodies.\\r\\nChapter 4 indicates that RalA, a small GTP-binding protein shown to be associated with Weibel-Palade bodies, is involved in the regulated exocytosis of these vesicles. RalA may interact with a putative exocyst leading to docking of Weibel-Palade bodies at the plasma membrane. \\r\\nVWF-propeptide, a Weibel-Palade constituent, was used as a marker for endothelial cell perturbation in Chapter 6 to determine whether endothelial cell activation is the primary event in the pathogenesis of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). We concluded that endothelial cell activation is not the primary event leading to TTP. Vascular perturbation seems a consequence rather than a cause of the disease.\\r\\nIn Chapter 7 the potential role of the VWF-propeptide as an inflammatory mediator was investigated. Neutrophil adhesion induced by IL-8 increased significantly upon co-stimulation with VWF-propeptide suggesting that the propeptide acts synergistically with IL-8 upon appropriate stimulation of the endothelium. \\r\\n\\r\\nTaken together, biogenesis and exocytosis of Weibel-Palade bodies are essential in the processes underlying hemostatic, thrombotic and inflammatory responses'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Extrapyramidal syndromes (EPS) are a group of movement disorders that result from damage in the basal ganglia and certain related thalamic and brainstem nuclei. EPS are either primary, i.e. due to a neurodegenerative disease, or secondary. Secondary forms can have different causes, the most important of which is the use of drugs. EPS that are seen as a side effect of drug treatment include parkinsonism, dysthonia, akathisa and dyskinesia. Numerous drugs have been reported to induce EPS. Epidemiologic studies showed that as much as one third to over one half of the cases of parkinsonism may be explained by the use of medication. EPS is especially common during treatment with antipsychotic drugs (APDs). Considering their disabling effect, clearly, drug-induced EPS have a strong negative impact on patients\\x92 well-being, compliance to treatment and as a result on treatment outcome. Thus, minimizing their frequency and severity is of clear clinical importance. This can be achieved either by prevention or by prompt diagnosis and treatment of symptoms. Both are greatly enhanced by knowing which drugs are implicated with EPS, to what extent, and which patients are most susceptible. \\nTo be able to reduce the occurrence of drug-induced EPS in the general population, the aim of this thesis is to quantify the risk of drug-induced EPS for drugs commonly associated with this side effect and to quantify the influence of specific risk factors.\\nThe first chapter reviews the current literature with regard to the epidemiology of drug-induced parkinsonism and assesses the validity of using prescription records of antiparkinsonian medication as a way to identify drug-induced EPS in medical databases. Chapter two focuses specifically on EPS resulting from antipsychotic medication, since these drugs still are by far the most important cause of EPS. In chapter three, risks and risk factors of EPS with drugs other than APDs are studied. Laslty, chapter four discusses the strengths and limitations of this thesis, the implications for medical and pharmaceutical practice, and suggestions for future research.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Allergic diseases, such as allergic asthma, are steadily increasing in developed countries. Most likely, the cause of the rise in allergic diseases must be sought in environmental factors. In this respect, the suggestion that a change in the level and the kind of early childhood infections would be factor influencing the development of allergic diseases has drawn most attention and discussion. This suggested relationship between hygiene and allergic disease is called the \\x93hygiene hypothesis\\x94. Basically, this hypothesis states that improved hygiene in industrialized societies, with improved public health measures and the use of vaccines and antibiotics has reduced the incidence of infections that normally stimulate the immune system in some way that mitigates against asthma. In line with the hygiene hypothesis it has been suggested that mycobacteria can be used as an \\x93anti-asthma\\x94 vaccine. In this thesis, the potential of a heat-killed preparation of M. vaccae (SRL172) was evaluated. \\r\\nFirst, in chapter 2 to 4, it was shown that administration of M. vaccae suppresses allergic and asthmatic responses in a mouse model during, but also after, the onset of allergic disease. Importantly, M. vaccae must be administered during allergen exposure to be effective in our model. This may have important implications for the application of M. vaccae in humans. The contradictive results in clinical trails using M. vaccae, but also BCG, may be due to the duration and/or the level of exposure to allergens during the treatment period. \\r\\nSecondly, in chapter 5, we hypothesized that genes controlling the resistance to bacterial infections can influence the development of allergic diseases as well. The Nramp1 gene is one of the best characterized genes controlling resistance to intracellular infections. Therefore, it was studied whether Nramp1 alleles, that determine resistance to intracellular bacteria, affect the sensitivity to the induction of allergic asthma as well. It was demonstrated that the Nramp1 gene affects the development of allergic, but not the development of asthmatic manifestations in a mouse model. In our opinion, Nramp1 may now be considered as a potential locus for susceptibility for allergy and allergic disease. Moreover, Nramp1 could provide a link between genes, the (bacterial) environment and the development of allergy. \\r\\nFinally, it was investigated in chapter 6 whether Nramp1 may be involved in treatment of allergic disease with heat-killed M. vaccae as well. It was demonstrated that Nramp1 indeed affected the efficacy of M. vaccae in reducing the allergic and asthmatic response. In addition, Nramp1 affected the macrophage activation after M. vaccae treatment and maybe as a result, Nramp1 affected T cell-mediated immune response to M. vaccae. \\r\\nIn summary, this thesis shows that the macrophage, which function is determined by Nramp1, may play a crucial role in the downregulation by mycobacteria of allergic and asthmatic responses. The macrophage, whose activation is regulated by Nramp1, seems to be a key cell connecting innate, natural immunity with the adaptive, cellular immunity, and therefore might be an important target for the treatment of asthma.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Factor VIII inhibitors in mild haemophilia A'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['The X-linked bleeding disorder haemophilia A is due to a deficiency or functional defect of coagulation factor VIII. The bleeding tendency can be corrected by administration of factor VIII concentrates. A serious complication of factor VIII replacement therapy is the development of anti-factor VIII antibodies (inhibitors) that neutralize factor VIII activity. In recent years, the epitope-specifities and the inhibitory mechanisms of factor VIII inhibitors have gained increasing interest. The generation of factor VIII knock-out mice has opened the possibility of studying the immunobiology of inhibitor formation in murine models of haemophilia A. In spite of these recent developments however, the immunological mechanisms underlying the anti-factor VIII immune response have remained poorly understood so far. Most of our current knowledge is based on studies on inhibitor formation in the severe form of haemophilia. However, inhibitors also occur in patients with mild haemophilia A, in particular after a period of extensive factor VIII replacement therapy. These patients differ from severe haemophiliacs in that they have low levels of circulating factor VIII activity (5-25% of normal). The presence of endogenous factor VIII may have major impact on the immune response to exogenous factor VIII during replacement therapy.  The studies presented in this thesis were performed to obtain a better understanding of the immunobiology of inhibitor development in mild haemophilia A. \\r\\nIn the introduction (chapter 1), recent studies on the immunobiology of factor VIII inhibitors in haemophilia A patients are summarized and discussed. We have characterized the anti-factor VIII antibodies in patients with mild haemophilia A employing phage display technology. In chapter 2, anti-C2 antibodies were isolated and characterized from the repertoire of a mild haemophilia A patient. Our results provide evidence for the presence of two classes of anti-C2 antibodies that recognize distinct antigenic sites in factor VIII. The characteristics of the anti-C2 antibodies were further analysed in chapter 3, and compared to the epitopes of previously described murine monoclonal antibodies. The first class of anti-C2 antibodies bind to the epitope defined by monoclonal antibody ESH4. The second class of antibodies bind to the epitope defined by monoclonal antibody CLB-CAg 117. Antibodies belonging to this second class of antibodies were also isolated from a different patient with mild haemophilia A (chapter 4). The VH gene segment usage of the antibodies directed at the epitope defined by CLB-CAg 117 is less restricted compared to the first class of anti-C2 antibodies. Based on the long CDR3 region, we argue that this second class of antibodies originates from a pool of polyreactive human antibodies.\\r\\nIn chapter 5, we describe the inhibitor development of a patient with mild haemophilia A caused by an Arg593 to Cys mutation. We have isolated and characterized anti-A2 antibodies using phage display and we have performed epitope-mapping studies of anti-factor VIII antibodies in plasma using immunoprecipitation analysis. The data presented in chapter 5 provide a possible explanation for anamnestic responses observed in patients with a history of inhibitor development. We propose that activation of a quiescent pool of memory B cells underlies the rise in inhibitor titer observed in haemophilia A patients with a history of inhibitor development. \\r\\nChapter 6 describes the epitope specificities of anti-factor VIII antibodies in another patient from our cohort of mild haemophilia A patients with the Arg593 to Cys mutation. Results from this chapter and previous studies show that high responder patients with the Arg593 to Cys substitution develop inhibitory antibodies predominantly directed at the A2 domain of factor VIII. This suggests that inhibitor formation proceeds via a common mechanism in these patients. The role of HLA class II alleles in inhibitor formation was investigated by HLA genotyping of 42 patients with the Arg593 to Cys mutation. Our data suggest a weak association between inhibitor development and HLA class II alleles in mild haemophilia A patients with the Arg593 to Cys mutation.\\r\\nIn Chapter 7, we present the characteristics of a mouse transgenic for human factor VIII with the Arg593 to Cys mutation (hufVIII-R593C mouse). The anti-factor VIII immune response was analysed in transgenic hufVIII-R593C mice crossed with factor VIII-deficient mice (exon 16 knock out, or E-16 KO mice). Serial intravenous injections of human factor VIII do not evoke an immune response in hufVIII-R593C/E-16 KO mice. The introduction of the human factor VIII\\x96R593C transgene renders the mice tolerant to human factor VIII. However, when hufVIII-R593C/E-16 KO mice were subcutaneously injected with factor VIII in the presence of an adjuvant, loss of tolerance to factor VIII was observed. The results of chapter 7 demonstrate that hufVIII-R593C/E-16 KO mice provide a valuable model for studies directed at the mechanisms underlying inhibitor development in haemophilia A.\\r\\nFinally, chapter 8 provides a general overview that discusses the implications of our findings.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['There is a great need for vaccines against Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B. This is especially important in Western European countries, were approximately two thirds of the cases of meningococcal disease can be attributed to serogroup B strains. Against this serogroup, traditional vaccines based on capsular polysaccharides are not effective. The immunogenicity of the capsular polysaccharide of group B meningococci is low, due to structural similarity with epitopes expressed by host neural tissue. During the search for vaccine candidates against serogroup B meningococci, a great interest has been focused on PorA, a porin located in the outer membrane of the bacteria. PorA is one of the immunodominant antigens expressed by Neisseria meningitidis. Monoclonal antibodies directed against PorA have shown to have a high bactericidal activity and are protective in an infant rat meningitis model. The vaccine potential of PorA embedded in outer membrane vesicles (OMV) developed by different groups has been studied in various clinical trials. The vaccine presently being developed by the Netherlands Vaccine Institute (NVI) is based on OMV purified from genetically modified meningococcal strains expressing three different PorA serosubtypes (trivalent OMV). The vaccine contains a mixture of two different trivalent OMV are mixed, which together represent the majority of PorA serosubtypes circulating in the Netherlands and other European countries. Among the PorA serosubtypes included in the NVI vaccine, the serosubtype P1.7-2,4 is present in up to 40% of the serogroup B strains causing bacterial meningitis. Thus, a PorA-based vaccine should cover at least this subtype. On the other hand, the immunogenicity of PorA P1.7-2,4 is not yet optimal in its present formulation as OMV vaccine. For these reasons, PorA P1.7-2,4 was chosen as a model protein for our studies. The objective this thesis was to improve the immunogenicity of PorA. The research was exclusively focused on the study of the effect of the presentation form on the immunogenicity of PorA P1.7-2,4. For this purpose, three lines of investigation were followed:\\r\\n? Detailed study of physicochemical and immunochemical characteristics of PorA and its presentation form. Also, study of the effects of different storage conditions on the physicochemical stability and immunogenicity of PorA formulated in different types of OMV. \\r\\n? Preparation of well-defined liposomal PorA formulations and study of the effect of various targeting strategies for dendritic cells (DC) on the immunogenicity of PorA.\\r\\n?

The monitoring of these drugs in biological fluids and tissues is important during both pre-clinical and clinical development and often in routine clinical use. Traditionally, liquid chromatography (LC) in combination with ultraviolet (UV), fluorescence, or electrochemical detection is employed for this purpose. The successful hyphenation of LC and mass spectrometry (MS), however, has dramatically changed this. MS detection provides better sensitivity and selectivity than UV detection and, in addition, is applicable to a significantly larger group of compounds than fluorescence or electrochemical detection. \\nFrom the analytical methods described in this thesis, it can be concluded that LC-MS/MS is very suitable for sensitive and selective quantitation of anticancer agents in biological samples. Furthermore, LC with an alkaline mobile phase in combination with MS detection in the positive ion mode appeared very useful for the analysis of four agents described in this thesis. This system may be applicable to other basic drugs. Finally, the use of internal standards is discussed. Stable isotopically labeled internal standards are the first choice, but deuterium labeled compounds may demonstrate unexpected behavior. \\n\\nIn summary, in this thesis the development and validation of LC-MS/MS methods for several anticancer agents are described. These assays were developed in order to support clinical pharmacological studies. LC-MS/MS appeared to be very suitable for this purpose.

The focus of this thesis was to identify the molecular mechanisms by which inherited enzymopathies of the red blood cell lead to impaired enzyme function and, consequently, shorten red blood cell survival. We studied patients with deficiencies of  key enzymes of the Embden-Meyerhof Pathway (hexokinase \\x96 HK  and pyruvate kinase \\x96 PK) and the Hexose Monophosphate Shunt (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase \\x96 G6PD). The clinical hallmark of these patients is chronic hemolysis as a result of a depletion of the cellular ATP content (HK or PK deficieny) or increased susceptibility to oxidative damage (G6PD deficiency). \\r\\nThe investigated mutations caused disease by means of a variety of mechanisms and affected several aspects of human gene expression. In chapter 2 we described a severely PK-deficient patient. In reticulocyte RNA from this patient we detected a monoallelic pattern of (mutant) PKLR gene expression, associated with three in cis mutations in the erythroid-specific promoter of PKLR. Ultimately, this led to the identification of a novel transcriptional regulatory element in the proximal promoter that was actively involved in DNA-protein interaction. The synthesis of only one species of mutant PK was also demonstrated in another patient with severe PK deficiency. In this case, the production of mutant PK was due to aberrant processing of PKLR pre-mRNA. The concerning patient, described in chapter 3, was compound heterozygous for two mutations which were both likely to affect correct splicing. A novel ex vivo approach was employed to study the effects of both mutations on pre-mRNA processing and multiple aberrant transcripts were characterized.\\r\\nOn the protein level, once a mutant enzyme is synthesized it may be unstable because of significant structural perturbation. In chapter 4 we studied 28 PK-deficient patients, classified according to their phenotype. Twenty-four different mutant alleles were identified, including 14 novel mutations. Of the novel mutations, 12 predicted a single amino acid substitution. We used the recently elucidated tetrameric crystal structure of human erythrocyte PK to study the consequences of the amino acid changes on structure and function of PK. The location and interactions of the affected amino acid, as well as the nature of the introduced substitution were important determinants for the resulting molecular perturbation and its impact on protein function. This was further illustrated by the two patients with severe G6PD deficiency, described in chapter 6. Both patients were hemizygous for a different G6PD variant caused by a de novo missense mutation. Both mutations affected the interface of the G6PD dimeric enzyme, a region crucial for G6PD enzymatic activity. The patients displayed, however, quite distinct clinical pictures.\\r\\nIn chapter 7 we showed that also subtle alterations in crucial areas of the enzyme can cause a severe impairment of enzyme function. In this case, a patient was diagnosed with severe HK deficiency caused by a conservative missense mutation in the active site of HK. Biochemical analysis of mutant HK from the patient displayed only a relatively modest effect of the amino acid substitution on enzymatic properties in vitro. However, we showed that it\\x92s reasonable to assume a more significant effect in vivo.\\r\\nThe variety of clinical features associated with the various enzymopathies, regardless of the underlying molecular mechanism, have unequivocally made clear that the phenotype of hereditary red blood cell enzymopathies is not solely dependent on the molecular properties of mutant proteins but rather reflects a complex interplay between physiological, environmental and other (genetic) factors.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Chemical knowledge can be applied in the field of immunology. It provides a better understanding of how a peptide interacts with proteins and cells of the immune system. However, it is not possible to predict the outcome of peptide administration in an animal. \\r\\nPeptides are used in experimental treatment of paralyzed rats, an animal model for human multiple sclerosis (MS). In this autoimmune disease, a T cell recognizes a peptide derived from self tissue. As a result, an aggressive reaction towards self tissue is initiated. When this peptide is modified slightly ( altered peptide ligand ) and administered as a drug, the wrong T cell activity can be stopped. Finally, the severity of an autoimmune disease can decrease in this way.\\r\\nFor development of such a specific treatment for autoimmune diseases, as well as to better understand the onset of autoimmunity, insight into the consequences of peptide modification is necessary. Besides, knowledge of the effect of peptide modification is important, because in the body itself also spontaneous conversions to proteins occur, some of which are related with the development of autoimmunity.\\r\\nWith molecular modeling techniques we investigated the structure of a (modified) peptide and how it interacts with proteins (MHC and T cell receptor). Subsequently, modified peptides were designed and synthesized. Using protein binding assays, T cell proliferation and in vivo experiments, the consequences of the peptide modification were investigated. Importantly, we were able to understand how modifications to the peptide led to changes in protein binding (to MHC) and recognition by the T cell. The step from a cell to a whole animal was too large. We could not predict how a peptide should be modified to create a therapeutic peptide that could decrease the paralysis in rats. More studies combining chemistry and immunology are expected to improve our understanding of autoimmunity as well as therapeutic strategies.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Magnetic resonance imaging in radiotherapy treatment planning'],\n",
       "  'Description': [\"From its inception in the early 1970's up to the present, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has evolved into a sophisticated technique, which has aroused considerable interest in var-\\nious subelds of medicine including radiotherapy. MRI is capable of imaging in any plane\\nand does not use ionizing radiation by virtue of which MRI lends itself admirably to the\\npurpose of prolonged time course studies. MRI is capable of excellent spatial resolution and\\nit presents information over large areas of the body. The MRI signal depends on multiple\\nparameters resulting in excellent contrast resolution of the soft tissues. Within the realm\\nof radiotherapy, MRI oers prospects with regards to identication of tissues and tissue ab-\\nnormalities (tumour, oedema, necrosis, brosis, cysts), determination of tumour extent in\\nrelation to surrounding tissues and organs and assessment of response to treatment. The\\ngoal of radiotherapy is to administer a high dose to the tumour while sparing healthy sur-\\nrounding tissues as much as possible. Since tight margins around the target are applied,\\naccurate information on tumour extent is of great value in radiotherapy treatment planning\\n(RTP). Also information on motion of the tumour and surrounding organs, e.g. caused\\nby respiration, is of importance for dening the margins and can be acquired by fast MR\\nimaging techniques. However, the introduction of MRI into RTP is seriously hampered by\\ngeometry and intensity distortions which are known to be present in MRI. These distortions\\nare caused by non-idealities of the equipment (non-uniformity of the static magnetic eld\\nand non-linearities of the gradient magnetic elds of the MRI scanner) and by magnetic eld\\nperturbations induced by the object to be imaged, in this case the patient. These magnetic\\neld inhomogeneities and gradient eld non-linearities lead to image distortions, the severity\\nof which depends on the type of pulse sequence and its parameters. The aim of this thesis\\nis to investigate the capabilities of MRI in radiotherapy treatment planning and to explore\\nthe MR image distortions and how distortions can be reduced or, if necessary, corrected in\\norder to integrate MRI into RTP in a reliable manner. Image distortions and the ecacy of\\ncorrection methods were evaluated in phantom, volunteer, and patient studies. Furthermore,\\nthe potential of MRI in organ motion studies was investigated and it was explored whether\\nthe image artifacts induced by I-125 seeds could be used to evaluate permanent prostate\\nimplants in brachytherapy.\\nChapter 1 introduces the potentials and problems with regard to the use of MRI for ra-\\ndiotherapy treatment planning and gives a review of the literature concerning MR image\\ndistortions, integration of MRI into RTP, MRI organ motion studies for RTP, and MRI-\\nbased brachytherapy evaluation.\\nChapter 2 brie y reviews the basic principles of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), spatial\\nencoding in MRI, and the sources of geometry and intensity distortions in MRI, viz. machine-\\nrelated magnetic eld inhomogeneity and gradient non-linearity and patient-related magnetic\\neld inhomogeneity due to chemical shift and susceptibility.\\nChapter 3 describes the measurement, analysis, and correction of machine dependent geo-\\nmetric distortions in MRI with special attention for phantom design and eld error stability\\nin time and for dierent pulse sequence parameters. Inhomogeneity of the static eld and\\nnon-linearity of the gradients was established by phantom experiments. A grid phantom\\nof equally spaced tubes appeared to be very suitable for this purpose. Interchanging the\\ndirections of the read-out and the phase-encoding gradients enabled decomposition of the\\nimage distortions into contributions from static eld inhomogeneity and the non-linearity of\\nthe three gradients. A 3D map of static eld inhomogeneity and non-linearity of the gra-\\n112?dients was thus obtained from sagittal, coronal, and transversal multiple slice images with\\nfor each acquisition the phantom positioned such that the tubes were perpendicular to the\\nimage plane. Time series of measurements on the Gyroscan S15 showed eld error stability\\nwithin the experimental errors of 1 ppm for static eld inhomogeneity and 1 mm for\\nthe gradient elds. Measurements on the Gyroscan ACS-NT, equipped with active shielding\\ntechnology, showed eld error stability under dierent imaging conditions. These observa-\\ntions imply that the measured error maps can be used for correction of patient images which\\nmay have been acquired with a pulse sequence that is not necessarily identical to the pulse\\nsequence applied for phantom imaging. The correction procedure reduced distortions up to\\n13 mm within a volume of interest (VOI) with dimensions 336 x 336 x 210 mm 3 to smaller\\nthan 2 mm. In a study on the Leksell frame, distortions up to 6.4 mm were reduced to\\nsmaller than 1.5 mm. We conclude that MR image corrections are necessary in applications\\nwhich require mm accuracy and that correction methods, based on 3D maps of static eld\\ninhomogeneity and gradient non-linearity, are feasible in clinical practice.\\nChapter 4 describes the analysis of the patient related magnetic eld perturbations and\\nresulting image distortions in case of MRI of the head and the pelvic region. The magnetic\\neld was calculated by numerically solving the Maxwell equations for a magnetostatic eld.\\nThe magnetic eld around the head resembled a dipole eld in the midsagittal plane of\\ncalculation with minimal eld perturbation on the diagonals. The magnetic eld in the\\nlocalization frame depended strongly on the orientation of the Perspex plates with respect\\nto the applied magnetic eld. The maximum spatial distortion of external landmarks in the\\nlocalization frame amounted 12.8 mm in a 1.5 T MR head image acquired with a relatively\\nweak read-out gradient of 0.68 mT/m. Susceptibility-induced distortions in the pelvic region\\nwere smaller than 3 mm in 1.5 T images acquired with a read-out gradient strength of\\n0.54 mT/m. Since susceptibility induced distortions are proportional to the static magnetic\\neld strength and inversely proportional to the gradient strength, we may conclude that\\nobject-related distortions can be reduced to the order of the pixel size by imaging at 0.5 T\\nand using gradient strengths on the order of 3 mT/m.\\nChapter 5 describes qualitatively the in uence of the type of pulse sequence and its param-\\neters on geometry and intensity distortions. The strength of the read-out gradient, which is\\ncontrolled by the water fat shift parameter, was the main factor aecting the severity of the\\nsusceptibility artifact. The range of water fat shifts, that could be selected, was in uenced\\nby the eld of view and the acquisition matrix. In echo planar imaging (EPI), the EPI factor\\n(number of proles acquired after a single excitation) strongly in uenced the water fat shift\\n(in pixels) in the phase encoding direction. In applications of MRI, which require geometric\\naccuracy, we should be aware that these parameters indirectly aect the severity of image\\ndistortions. Spatial distortions occurred in the direction of the read-out gradient in spin echo\\n(SE) and fast eld echo (FFE) imaging, but also and more strongly in the direction of the\\nphase-encoding gradient in echo planar imaging. The direction of the read-out gradient was\\ncontrolled by the fold-over direction parameter which is the direction of the phase-encoding\\ngradient. Signal loss was most severe in FFE images acquired with relatively long echo\\ntimes and/or in case of partial k -space sampling (reduced scan matrix, half matrix or partial\\necho). Generally, highest accuracy and least signal loss is achieved in spin echo imaging with\\nminimal water fat shift and in fast eld echo imaging with minimal water fat shift and short\\necho time.\\n113?Chapter 6 describes the investigation of geometric distortions in 1.5 T MR images for use\\nin radiotherapy treatment planning of patients with brain tumours. Patients underwent\\nmagnetic resonance imaging in the radiotherapy position with the head xed by a plastic cast\\nin a Perspex localization frame. For purposes of accuracy assessment, external and internal\\nlandmarks were indicated. Tubes attached to the cast and in the localization frame served\\nas external landmarks. In the mid-sagittal plane the brain-sinus sphenoidalis interface, the\\npituitary gland-sinus sphenoidalis interface, the sphenoid bone and the corpora of the cervical\\nvertebra served as internal landmarks. Landmark displacements as observed in the reversed\\nread-out gradient experiments were analyzed with respect to the contributions of machine\\nrelated static magnetic eld inhomogeneity and susceptibility and chemical shift artifacts.\\nIn this study at 1.5 T with read-out gradient strength of 3 mT/m, machine related and\\nsusceptibility induced static magnetic eld inhomogeneity were on the same order, resulting\\nin spatial distortions between\"],\n",

       "  'Description': ['This study discusses the relationship between physicians and collective health-insurance funds at the national tier in the Netherlands and at the regional tier of ‘’Midden-Nederland’’. This region consists of the urban areas of Utrecht, Amersfoort and Zeist, i.e. the larger part of the Province of Utrecht and the western part of the Province of Gelderland. Historical research reveals the nature of the relationship between these parties, the manner in which it developed over the years and the factors that affected this relationship. National and regional development of the relationship are compared. Policy making and implementation of collective health-insurance funds with its attendant conformity and difference, nationally and regionally, are the central focal point.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo types of relationship are distinguished: conflict relationships and harmony relationships. In the former the partners are hardly or not at all prepared to harmonise their objectives or adjust their interests and ideologies. If neither of the partners may dominate the other there is an inconclusive power game, a delicate balance of power. Harmony relationships aim at completely or partly coinciding objectives and partners are prepared to cooperate, a stable balance of power. Two groups of factors have affected the physicians-funds relationship: those factors that directly concern the relationship and external developments. The former are the ideas and the characters of the people involved, ideology, mutual dependency, social emancipation of the professions, power, collectivisation and concentration. External factors may be economic and social developments, such as economic growth and recession, war, occupation and peace, compartmentalisation, relationship with the authorities, influence of the trade unions, development of medical science and growth of health care.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter 1930 scale increase in the relationship became important. Examples of scale increase are umbrella organisations, mergers of organisations and increasingly central protection of interests. Three types of scale increase may be distinguished: collectivisation, concentration and regionalisation. Collectivisation is transferring power to higher bodies, such as umbrella organisations. Concentration is the merger of equivalent bodies. Regionalisation is composing a region with a coherent system of health-care provisions, resources and insurance. \\r\\nAfter 1941 scale increase got a pragmatic character. Pragmatism implies that the physicians-funds relationship was increasingly decided by regulation, material interests and cooperation in policy making in health care rather than by the struggle for ideological principles or the administrative power of the funds as was the case in the previous period.\\r\\nUntil 1941 collective health-insurance funds, physicians and pharmacists, who had become a rather important second group of care providers in the relationship, had been free as to how to organise collective health-insurance funds: the collective health-insurance funds market. On 1 November 1941 the Collective Health Insurance Law was introduced and it put a stop to this market. As a consequence the influence of the central government on collective-health insurance funds and the relationship increased more and more.\\r\\nThe relationship may be divided into three periods: 1827 to 1908, 1908 to 1940 and 1940 to 1996.\\r\\nEach period is a part of this study.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['In this retrospective study we describe the MR imaging findings in 230 consecutive patients with suspected pathology in or near the brachial plexus. These patients were\\nstudied from 1991 through to 1996.\\nChapter 2 describes the anatomy and the MR imaging techniques. As the anatomy\\nof the brachial plexus and the related structures is quite complicated, we eventually\\nuse as protocol of choice a 3D volume acquisition for the best understanding of this\\ncomplex anatomy. The advantages of this 3D volume acquisition are, besides the\\nuse of thin overlapping slices, the MPR and cine-display viewing mode possibilities.\\nThe use of thin slices (2 mm) provides excellent anatomical detail. The following\\nanatomic details can be discerned: the individual ventral rami of the nerve roots, the\\nthree trunks, the three cords and the stellate ganglion. The overlapped images can be\\nreconstructed in any plane with the same image quality, and the use of the cine-display\\nviewing mode affords a better insight into the continuity of the nerves and\\nvessels. In our experience, the use of a 3D volume acquisition markedly improves\\nthe understanding of the normal anatomy of the brachial plexus on MR imaging and\\ncan possibly better delineate the pathology involving the brachial plexus.\\nChapter 3 mainly deals with the tumors we have found in or near the brachial plexus.\\nIn this chapter we also describe a group of patients alleged to have a tumor, but\\nwhere no tumor was found.\\nThe first group consists of 66 patients where a tumor in or near the brachial plexus\\nwas found with MR imaging. We found 10 neurogenic tumors (five schwannomas,\\none neurofibroma, two malignant schwannomas and two without a histological\\ndiagnosis). These tumors show characteristic MR imaging findings: a low signal\\nintensity on the T1-weighted images, an increased signal intensity on the proton-density\\nimages, a high signal intensity on the T2-weighted images, enhancement\\nafter administration of gadolinium-DTPA, a fusiform growth, a sharply defined edge,\\nand the involved nerve can often be found entering and leaving the tumor. These\\nspecific imaging characteristics applied to nine of these 10 tumors. Besides these 10\\nChapter 7\\nSummary and Conclusions?102 Chapter 7\\nneurogenic tumors, we describe 56 non-neurogenic tumors: lung tumor (n=24),\\nmetastasis of breast carcinoma (n=9), metastasis of other tumors (n=8), B-cell non-Hodgkin\\x92s\\nlymphoma (n=2), leiomyosarcoma (n=1), liposarcoma (n=1),\\nchondrosarcoma (n=2), synoviosarcoma (n=1), aggressive fibromatosis (n=2),\\nmeningocele (n=1), lipoma (n=3), a hematoma in a neck cyst (n=1), and one tumor\\nof unknown origin. In the preoperative evaluation of tumors near the brachial plexus,\\nthe 3D volume acquisition provides the radiologists and the surgeons with better\\ninsight into the precise extension of the tumor. MR imaging could delineate the\\nextension of these tumors well, and determine whether or not there was brachial\\nplexus involvement.\\nThe second group consists of 70 patients where no tumor was detected with MR\\nimaging. Three patients had an infection, 17 patients were imaged after radiation\\ntherapy and had no signs of tumor recurrence, and 50 patients had normal MR imaging\\nfindings.\\nChapter 4 discusses the value of MR imaging in patients with brachial plexopathy\\nafter trauma and in patients with thoracic outlet syndromes.\\nWe found 31 abnormal MR imaging investigations in patients with a history of\\ntrauma. Ten of these patients presented with a flail arm after a severe accident, in\\nmost cases a motorcycle accident. In five of these patients an additional 3D-TSE\\nsequence of the C-spine was done in order to visualize traumatic nerve root avulsions\\nand traumatic meningoceles. Abnormalities we found in this group were thickening\\nof the brachial plexus, hematoma, and a clavicle fracture with compression of the\\nbrachial plexus. We were not able to visualize a rupture of the brachial plexus, nor\\nvisualize all the nerve root avulsions. Abnormalities we found in the remaining 21\\npatients included clavicle fractures with suspected brachial plexus compression\\n(n=14), traumatic meningoceles in patients with known nerve root avulsions to\\nexclude neuroma formation (n=3), a stab wound (n=1), a coracoid process fracture\\n(n=1), a battered child (n=1) and a shoulder luxation (n=1).\\nIn 18 patients with a history of trauma MR imaging was normal. Two of these patients\\nwere operated upon and appeared to have a rupture of a part of the brachial plexus.\\nWe conclude that MR imaging is not very good at predicting the surgical findings in\\ncases of brachial plexus rupture or nerve root avulsions. MR imaging can be helpful\\nin demonstrating brachial plexus compression by a hematoma or a clavicle fracture\\nwith callus formation.\\nIn this chapter we also describe a group of 23 patients with a wide variety of symptoms,\\nwhich could be due to a thoracic outlet syndrome. In three patients a cervical rib was\\npresent, two patients had had a cervical rib removal previously. In one patient, who\\nhad the typical true neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome, a slight angulation of the\\nventral ramus of root C8 was seen, which appeared to be due to a fibrous band at\\nsurgery. Most patients did not show any abnormalities with MR imaging. We were?Summary and Conclusions 103\\nnot able to demonstrate a fibrous band with MR imaging. We conclude that MR\\nimaging in patients with a thoracic outlet syndrome is not very useful, except for\\nserving to exclude other structural abnormalities.\\nChapter 5 describes the MR imaging appearance of radiation-induced brachial\\nplexopathy. MR imaging was performed in two patients with the clinical diagnosis\\nof radiation-induced brachial plexopathy and in one with surgically proven radiation\\nfibrosis of the brachial plexus. Three patients who had had radiation therapy to the\\naxilla and supraclavicular region (two with breast carcinoma and one with Hodgkin\\x92s\\nlymphoma) presented with symptoms of the arm and hand. To exclude metastases\\nor tumor recurrence MR imaging was performed. In one patient, fibrosis showing\\nlow signal intensity was found, while in two patients high signal intensity fibrosis\\nsurrounding the brachial plexus was found on the T2-weighted images. In one case\\ngadolinium-DTPA enhancement of the fibrosis 21 years after radiation therapy was\\nseen. We conclude that radiation-induced brachial plexopathy can have different\\nMR imaging appearances. We found that radiation fibrosis can have both low and\\nhigh signal intensities on T2-weighted images, and that fibrosis can enhance even\\ndecades after radiation therapy.\\nIn Chapter 6 we studied whether MR imaging of the brachial plexus is useful to\\ndistinguish multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) from lower motor neuron disease\\n(LMND) and whether abnormalities resemble those of chronic inflammatory\\ndemyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP). MMN is a potentially treatable pure\\nmotor neuropathy which clinically resembles LMND. Both diseases are characterized\\nby progressive asymmetric weakness of the limbs and muscular atrophy without\\nsensory symptoms. CIDP is a symmetric polyneuropathy which affects both motor\\nand sensory fibers. Both CIDP and MMN are probably immune-mediated\\nneuropathies, as autoantibodies to peripheral nerve myelin have been found.\\nWe compared MR imaging scans of the brachial plexus from nine patients with\\nMMN with scans from five patients with CIDP, eight patients with LMND, and 174\\ncontrols. In two patients with MMN, and in three patients with CIDP, the MR imaging\\nscans showed an increased signal intensity on the T2-weighted images of the brachial\\nplexus. Two other patients with MMN demonstrated a more focal increased signal\\nintensity on the T2-weighted images, in one patient only in the axilla, and in one\\npatient in the axilla and in the ventral rami of the roots. MR imaging of the brachial\\nplexus of eight patients with LMND was normal. The distribution of the MR imaging\\nabnormalities corresponded with the distribution of symptoms of the patients:\\nasymmetrical in MMN and symmetrical in CIDP. These findings demonstrate that\\nMR imaging abnormalities of the brachial plexus in patients with MMN resemble\\nthose seen in CIDP and may be useful to distinguish MMN from LMND.?104 Chapter 7'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['This thesis subject is the improvement of the formulation of inhaled aerosols. It is well known that the formulation of inhaled drugs is not optimal: the major part of the mass delivered does not reach the lower airways. This phenomenon is due to the\\r\\n   particle size of the inhaled particles, which is too large. Reduction of the size is the answer to this problem, but size reduction has\\r\\n   its limits: too small particles do not deposit and are exhaled. The optimum between too large and too small is not known and has\\r\\n   been the main object of this research project. The optimal particle size of a ß2-mimetic aerosol was determined in 8 stable\\r\\n   asthmatics with a FEV1 of 72% of the predicted and it was shown that in these mild asthmatics the particle size of choice for a\\r\\n   ß2-mimetic aerosol should be around 2.8 m m. Based on the distribution of the pulmonary receptors we expected that for\\r\\n   parasympathicolytic aerosol a more central deposition pattern would be best. The latter being equivalent to a large optimal\\r\\n   particle size. However, in mild asthmatics the optimal particle size for an ipratropium bromide aerosol also proved to be # 2.8 mm.\\r\\n   Based deposition theories, we hypothesised that the optimal particle size of a 82-agonist or parasympathicolytic aerosol in\\r\\n   patients with severe airflow obstruction had to be smaller, because these particles must pass obstructed airways. 7 stable\\r\\n   patients with a mean FEV1 of 37.9% of predicted value inhaled three types of monodisperse salbutamol and ipratropium bromide\\r\\n   aerosols, with particle sizes of 1.5 :m, 2.8 :m and 5 :m, respectively, and a placebo aerosol. Greater improvements in FEV1 were\\r\\n   induced by the 2.8 :m aerosol than by the other particle sizes. The dilatations in the previous experiments were already clinically\\r\\n   relevant at low dosages. To discover whether the bronchodilator effects of these low dosed monodisperse aerosols differed from\\r\\n   those of standard dosages delivered by metered dose inhalers, we carried out a comparative trial. 10 stable outpatients, with a\\r\\n   mean FEV1 of 58.1 % of predicted, inhaled a placebo aerosol, 8 µg of a 2.8 µm monodisperse ipratropium bromide aerosol and 40\\r\\n   µg from a metered dose inhaler plus spacer, followed by lung function measurements. We were able to show that the low dosed\\r\\n   2.8 µm aerosol proved to be equivalent to the higher dosed metered dose inhaler. Subsequently we compared the adverse effects\\r\\n   of 160 µg fenoterol in the form of a 2.8 µm monodispers aerosol to those of 800 µg as a conventional metered dose inhaler\\r\\n   aerosol. In twelve healthy volunteers changes in serum potassium, finger tremor, blood pressure, heart rate and specific airway\\r\\n   conductance were measured before and 15 min after administration. Potassium levels decreased by 0.27 mmol/l after the\\r\\n   monodispers aerosol, while the MDI lowered it by 0.67 mmol/l (p=0.001). Finger tremor also increased less. There was no\\r\\n   significant specific airway conductance differences between the two actives. The overall conclusion of these experiments is that\\r\\n   the best choice for a bronchodilator aerosol size are particles of 2.8 µm. When aerosols are composed of these particles, the dose\\r\\n   of inhaled bronchodilators, relative to metered dose inhalers, can be reduces by 80%. This is accompanied by a major reduction\\r\\n   in adverse effects.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Spontaneous preterm birth : prevention, management and outcome'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Preterm birth (birth before 37 completed weeks of pregnancy) is a major cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality. Strategies to prevent and adequately treat preterm labour, in order to postpone birth and to identify risk factors for neonatal damage due to preterm birth, have to be developed by obstetricians and neonatologists to improve perinatal outcome. Although preterm delivery is known to result from heterogeneous pathological conditions roughly two major pathways lead to preterm birth:\\n? activation of the fetal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis due to fetal stress or hypoxia can lead to increase of corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH) stimulating prostaglandin E2 (PgE2) synthesis\\n? an inflammatory reaction at the chorio-decidual interface, resulting either from a haemorrhage, trauma or microbial infection, can result in cytokine production and an increase in PgE2 synthesis. Depending on the primary site of inflammation the initiation of cytokine production can result in either preterm contractions with cervical softening or rupture of membranes (ROM) with or without contractions.\\nThe increased bioavailability of PgE2 will lead to parturition as in the term period. Various micro-organisms found in the vaginal flora have been associated with preterm birth but no causal relationship between a specific micro-organism and preterm birth could be established. However in women with bacterial vaginosis, a condition where the normal lactobacilli dominant flora is replaced by anaerobe micro-organisms a higher incidence of preterm birth is found. The increased incidence of chorioamnionitis, early onset neonatal infectious disease and endometritis observed in preterm birth points to a relationship between infectious aetiology and preterm birth. This relation of infection with preterm parturition is the focus of interest in this thesis (Chapter 1). The association of bacterial vaginosis with preterm delivery was the rationale for the hypothesis that antibiotics aimed against bacterial vaginosis related micro-organisms, might reduce the incidence of preterm birth in women at high risk for preterm delivery. In a double-blind placebo-controlled study we investigated whether clindamycin 2% vaginal creme prophylacticly given at 26 and 32 weeks could reduce the incidence of prematurity in a group of women, who had a preterm delivery after spontaneous onset of labour with or without PROM in the preceding pregnancy. The placebo group consisted of 72 women, the clindamycin group of 70. Clindamycin was unable to reduce the incidence of preterm birth when compared to the placebo group (21% preterm birth in the placebo group versus 30% in the clindamycin group). Even an adverse effect was seen; in the clindamycin group significantly more neonatal infectious morbidity was seen (p<.05) (Chapter 2). This is probably caused by changes in the vaginal flora due to clindamycin treatment. \\nWe analysed the changes in the vaginal flora during clindamycin or during placebo treatment in the pregnant women described in Chapter 2. The alterations in type vaginal flora (normal, intermediate or vaginosis) after clindamycin treatment or placebo were analysed using Cohen`s kappa for similarity. There were 31 women in the clindamycin group and 33 in the placebo group. We found a tendency towards the development of bacterial vaginosis during clindamycin treatment in women with a normal type vaginal flora while the vaginal flora did not change during placebo treatment (Chapter 3). The most likely explanation is that clindamycin is bactericidal against peroxide producing lactobacilli necessary for the maintenance of a normal flora. This effect has been demonstrated in vitro before and in vivo a short lasting alteration of the vaginal flora with overgrowth of E.coli and Enterobacteriaceae after treatment of bacterial vaginosis with clindamycin was observed (Chapter 3). \\nIt is concluded from these data that antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of preterm delivery in a group of women with a history of preterm birth with clindamycin 2% vaginal creme is not effective and can even increase neonatal infectious morbidity. However recent studies have demonstrated that antibiotic treatment of bacterial vaginosis early in the second trimester reduces significantly the incidence of preterm birth in women with a spontaneous preterm birth in the previous pregnancy. In these studies metronidazole was used and recently this drug has been approved by the FDA for use during the second and third trimester of pregnancy 1. Treatment of bacterial vaginosis early in pregnancy without additional risk factors for preterm birth did not result in a decreased incidence of preterm delivery.\\nManagement of preterm labour with or without PROM is generally aimed at prolongation of the duration of pregnancy since neonatal mortality is closely related to gestational age at birth. In cases of PROM, the threat of an intra-amniotic infection during expectant management warrants a close supervision in order to detect infection in an early stage. We analysed the outcome of an expectant management in 89 cases of preterm PROM between 24 and 37 weeks. The effect of this management was analysed by comparing actual survival rate at birth with a calculated survival rate at the moment of rupture of membranes. When membranes ruptured before 28 weeks there was a significant increase in survival rate during expectant management when comparing actual survival rate at birth with a calculated survival rate at the moment of rupture of membranes. In cases where membranes were ruptured for more than one week also a beneficial prolongation of pregnancy was seen, leading to an increased survival rate. This happened in 41 % of the cases where membranes ruptured before 34 weeks. After this period no prolongation for more than 7 days or increase in survival was seen; however, infectious morbidity (sepsis or sepsis-like disease) occurred in 10%. We conclude that the neonate benefits by an expectant management in cases of PROM before 34 weeks in terms of survival. Whether an active management of PROM after 34 weeks is justified needs to be investigated (Chapter 4).\\nDiagnosing an intra-amniotic infection during expectant management of PROM between 24 and 37 weeks was done according to generally excepted criteria, being leucocytosis, fetal tachycardia, uterine tenderness, foul smelling discharge and fever above 37.5* C. In a group of 87 women an intra-amniotic infection was diagnosed in 43. We correlated the clinical diagnosis with evidence of infection found postpartum; placental histology; neonatal infectious morbidity and microbiology. The sensitivity and specificity of the \\x91clinical\\x92 diagnosis intra-amniotic infection varied between 56% and 78% using the above mentioned infection outcome parameters alone or combined. There was a high positive predictive value (95%) but a low negative predictive value (30%). We conclude that although the generally used monitoring system detects an intra-amniotic infection effectively, it does not eliminate the possible presence of such an intra-amniotic infection when the clinical diagnosis intra-amniotic infection is not made (Chapter 5).\\nNeonates born before 34 weeks after spontaneous onset of labour with or without intact membranes have an increased risk for cranial ultrasound abnormalities such as intraventricular haemorrhage or periventricular leucomalacia when compared to neonates born after elective delivery due to fetal or maternal diseases. Cytokines and interleukins associated with the spontaneous onset of preterm labour are also related with the occurrence of intraventricular haemorrhage and periventricular leucomalacia. We investigated whether perinatal risk factors for cranial ultrasound abnormalities could be identified in neonates born before 34 weeks after the spontaneous onset of labour with or without PROM. We found in the study group consisting of 205 neonates born between 24 and 34 weeks, severe cranial ultrasound abnormalities in 27 neonates. Three perinatal risk factors could be identified; gestational age; a full course of antenatal corticosteroids and neonatal early onset infectious disease. Increasing gestational age at birth protected against the development of cranial ultrasound abnormalities as well as a full course of antenatal steroids. This finding is in agreement with the literature and is additional to the effect of steroids on lung maturation. Corticosteroids increase blood pressure and prevent neonatal blood pressure fluctuations, which may explain the protective effect of corticosteroids against cranial ultrasound abnormalities. Neonatal early onset infectious disease (infectious disease within the first 48 hours after birth) increased the risk for neonatal cranial ultrasound abnormalities (Chapter 6). These early onset infectious diseases already start in utero and are difficult to detect antenatally since clinical signs are not conclusive (Chapter 5). Antibiotics given during labour for reasons of intra-amniotic infection; as a continuation of antepartum treatment for group b streptococci colonisation or urinary tract infection showed a trend towards protection against cranial ultrasound abnormalities in the survivors (Chapter 6). Along with attempts to prolong gestation and the administration of steroids in cases of spontaneous preterm birth a more liberal use of antibiotics to prevent early onset infection might be a next step in preventing early neonatal neurological damage. Meta-analyses of randomised studies of prophylactic use of antibiotics in cases of preterm PROM showed that antibiotics protected against intraventricular haemorrhage in the neonate. Antibiotic treatment also resulted in a prolonged latency period between ROM and delivery. Whether these antibiotics act directly against causative micro-organisms or act through other mechanisms is unclear. \\nIn Chapter 7 the results are presented of a study where perinatal risk factors were assessed for the neurodevelopmental outcome of the neonates born before 34 weeks after spontaneous onset of labour with or without PROM as described in Chapter 6. In a group of 185 neonates we found an adverse neurodevelopmental outcome in 61 (33%). An adverse neurodevelopmental outcome was defined as a low developmental quotient, cerebral palsy, a major neurological disability or neonatal death due to severe neurological. A forward logistic regression analysis showed that increasing gestational age at birth protected against an adverse outcome while neonatal ultrasound abnormalities and the need for a second antibiotic treatment in the neonatal period increased the risk for an adverse neurodevelopmental outcome. Neonatal cranial ultrasound abnormalities were especially associated with cerebral palsy when compared to those with a normal outcome. A low developmental quotient without cerebral palsy or major neurological disability was associated with low gestational age at birth. The most important factors in preventing neurological damage in infants is to increase gestational age at birth and to avoid the development of intraventricular haemorrhage and cystic periventricular leucomalacia by administering antenatal steroids and by avoiding an early onset neonatal infection. The latter may be realised by a more aggressive use of peripartum antibiotics and may be the next step in the management of cases with spontaneous preterm labour with or without PROM.\\nSummarising the data presented in this thesis, the following conclusions are drawn:\\n? Prophylaxis with clindamycin 2% vaginal creme in pregnant women with a spontaneous preterm delivery in the preceding pregnancy to prevent preterm birth does not decrease the incidence.\\n? Prophylaxis with clindamycin 2% vaginal creme in pregnant women with a history spontaneous preterm birth results in changes of the normal vaginal flora towards the development of bacterial vaginosis \\n? An expectant management aimed at prolongation of the duration of pregnancy in cases with rupture of the membranes before 34 weeks is beneficial for the fetus with respect to mortality.\\n? The antenatal diagnosis of intra-amniotic infection in cases of prolonged rupture of the membranes has a low sensitivity and specificity when compared to histological, microbiological and neonatal signs of an intra-amniotic bacterial infection.\\n? Perinatal risk factors associated with severe cranial ultrasound abnormalities in the neonate born before a gestational age of 34 weeks are gestational age at birth, antenatal administration of corticosteroids and early onset infectious disease.\\n? Perinatal factors associated with an adverse neurodevelopmental outcome in neonates born before a gestational age of 34 weeks are gestational age, the development of severe cranial ultrasound abnormalities and a second treatment with antibiotics in the early neonatal period. Gestational age is mainly associated with a low developmental score while cranial ultrasound abnormalities are mainly associated with cerebral palsy.\\nRecommendations for the clinician:\\n? Antibiotic prophylaxis or treatment is not indicated in women with a history of spontaneous preterm birth in general but is only advised in women with such a history and who have bacterial vaginosis in the ongoing pregnancy.\\n? Antibiotic prophylaxis is not (yet) indicated in cases of threatened preterm birth with intact membranes and the results of ongoing randomised trials have to be awaited.\\n? Antibiotic prophylaxis in cases with rupture of the membranes before 34 weeks is advised since it has been demonstrated that antibiotics increase the duration of pregnancy and decrease the incidence of neonatal sepsis. Both gestational age and neonatal early onset infection are significantly associated with the development of severe cranial ultrasound abnormalities and neurodevelopmental outcome in the infant.\\n? Antibiotic prophylaxis during preterm birth is advised in cases of prolonged rupture of the membranes before 34 weeks of gestation even in cases without clinical signs of chorioamnionitis since in a majority an intra-amniotic infection is present. When signs of a chorioamnionitis are present during labour antibiotic therapy is absolutely indicated.\\n? Antibiotic prophylaxis during preterm birth may be indicated in cases with intact membranes especially in early gestation to prevent early onset neonatal infections\\nREFERENCE \\n1.

       "  'Description': ['The protozoan parasites Cryptosporidium parvum and Giardia intestinalis have emerged as significant waterborne pathogens over the past decades. Many outbreaks of waterborne cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis have been recorded,primarily in the United States and the United Kingdom.Chapter 1 gives an overview on the currently available knowledge on the parasites, the disease, the transmission through drinking water and the measures to prevent waterborne transmission. The disease caused by Cryptosporidium and Giardia consists of a self-limiting diarrhoea that lasts for several days in the majority of cases, but the burden of disease and the mortality are high in the immunocompromised part of the infected population.\\r\\nSeveral characteristics of the parasites facilitate their waterborne transmission: they are very resistant to environmental stress and to chemical disinfection, they can be transmitted from livestock and wildlife to man and their infectivity is high, so even a dose of 1 (oo)cyst gives a discrete probability of infection. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe abundance and size of drinking waterborne outbreaks in developed countries show that transmission of Giardia and Cryptosporidium by drinking water is a significant risk. In the case of Cryptosporidium, the absence of an adequate cure for immunocompromised patients increases the problem. Although the outbreaks receive most attention, low-level transmission of these protozoa through drinking water is very likely to occur. Cysts and oocysts are regularly found in drinking water, although only a small proportion may be viable and infectious to man. A\\r\\nmajor drawback for the determination of the health significance of (oo)cysts in (drinking) water is that methods for a sensitive and specific detection of infectious (oo)cysts, with a consistently high recovery are not available. The cause of drinking water contamination with these parasites that led to the reported outbreaks was not limited to obvious treatment inadequacies or post treatment contamination, but also occurred in apparently well-treated water. Moreover, in several outbreaks, the coliforms, the parameter that was used to demonstrate the microbiological safety of drinking water did not warn against parasite breakthrough through the treatment, particularly because the coliforms were more efficiently eliminated by disinfection than both parasites. Surveys of surface water show that these parasites are ubiquitously present in the aquatic environment, even in pristine environments. Hence, all surface water treatment systems have to deal with these protozoa. These developments raised concern over the safety of Dutch drinking water with regard to Cryptosporidium and Giardia. Considering this situation, the Dutch drinking water companies and government initiated a research programme to determine the (im)probability of transmission of Cryptosporidium and Giardia\\r\\nthrough drinking water (Chapter 2).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe protozoa have changed the philosophy in the developed countries towards safe-guarding of drinking water from monitoring of the ‘end-product’ drinking water to monitoring raw water and the efficiency of the treatment. Furthermore, the extreme resistance of these organisms implies that a “zero-risk” is no longer achievable. Treatments should be designed to reduce the (oo)cyst concentrations in the raw water as far as possible and preferably include filtration step(s). This implies that information on the parasite concentrations in the raw water is\\r\\nnecessary, as well as information on the removal efficiency of the treatment. Quantitative risk assessment provides a tool for the combination of information on raw water quality (concentrations detected, recovery of the detection method, viability) and treatment efficiency (removal by different steps in the treatment).'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The aim of this thesis was defined as the study of the contribution of IPV vaccination to the induction of a) protection against poliovirus infection and b) mucosal immunity.We have described the development of new immunological tools for the rapid\\ndetection of poliovirus-specific antibodies and have investigated the induction of\\nmucosal immunity after IPV vaccination. Our studies compared the immunity induced\\nby IPV vaccination to the immune responses after OPV vaccination and/or exposure\\nto wild-type poliovirus.\\nThe presence of antibodies that protect individuals from poliomyelitis is usually\\ndetermined by a neutralisation assay using cell cultures. Cell culture assays, however,\\nare technically demanding. Disadvantages of the serum neutralisation test (NT)\\ninclude its long duration and the need for a manual screening of the test results,\\nmaking this assay labour intensive, difficult to standardise and less suitable for the\\nscreening of large populations. Other assays able to detect poliovirus-specific\\nantibodies have been developed within the last decade [6,7]. However, the new assays\\nestimating immunity to polioviruses measure both neutralising and non-neutralising\\nantibodies, whereas it is the presence of neutralising antibodies that is correlated with\\nprotection from (re)infection.\\nA newly developed inhibition ELISA known as the PoBI test (Chapter 2) can replace\\nthe NT for the determination of protective levels of antibodies to polioviruses in large-scale\\npopulation studies. Correlations between the PoBI test and the NT were high:\\n0.89, 0.89 and 0.84 for serotypes 1, 2 and 3 respectively. The sensitivity of the\\ninhibition ELISA was 98.6%, 97.4% and 92.1% for serotypes 1, 2 and 3 respectively.\\nThe specificity of the PoBI test as determined with sera from non-vaccinated persons\\nwas also high for all three serotypes (99.0%, 95.8% and 100% for serotypes 1, 2 and 3\\nrespectively). One of the major advantages of the PoBI test over the NT is the use of\\ninactivated virus as the antigen. In view of the ongoing eradication of poliovirus, the\\nuse of live poliovirus in diagnostic assays should be discouraged and must cease\\naltogether in the near future. Under these circumstances, the PoBI assay is an\\nexcellent replacement for the standard NT.\\nThree important antigenic sites (epitopes) involved in virus neutralisation have been\\nidentified on polioviruses in mouse experiments [13]. It has been reported that trypsin,\\npresent in the intestinal fluids, can cleave serotype 3 polioviruses at antigenic site 1\\n[14]. Trypsin cleavage of poliovirus results in drastically altered antigenic properties,\\nand trypsin-cleaved viruses may escape neutralisation by monoclonal antibodies to\\nantigenic site 1 [9].\\nAntibody responses to antigenic sites 1 and 3 were determined in fully IPV- or OPV-vaccinated\\nrecipients and in individuals who had been naturally infected (Chapter 3)\\nin order to study the immunogenicity of these sites in humans and the effect of trypsin\\nexposure in vivo. Both sites were immunogenic in naturally infected humans. No\\nsignificant differences were detected in the responses to antigenic site 1 between IPV-and\\nOPV-recipients. However, significantly more OPV recipients (88.7%) had\\ndetectable antibodies to antigenic site 3 (p<0.01) when compared to IPV-vaccinated\\npersons (63.1%).\\nWhile there are no major differences in the systemic humoral immune response\\nbetween IPV- and OPV-vaccinated persons, it is not clear whether parenteral\\nvaccination with IPV can lead to priming of the mucosal immune system. We?Summary\\n122\\ndeveloped and evaluated ELISAs for the detection of poliovirus serotype-specific IgA\\nand secretory IgA antibodies, and used these assays to examine IgA responses after\\nwild-type infection or vaccination (described in Chapter 4). All of the examined\\npoliomyelitis patients developed a humoral poliovirus-specific IgA response after\\ninfection with wild-type poliovirus. In addition, poliovirus-specific IgA was found\\nmore frequently in OPV-vaccinated persons than in IPV-vaccinated persons.\\nWe observed an age-related increase in the seroprevalence of IgA in the IPV-vaccinated\\npopulation of The Netherlands. These results may be explained by the\\nassumption that IgA is induced by infection with live poliovirus (wild-type or OPV\\nstrains) in the older population, and is unrelated to the IPV vaccination schedule. This\\nis best illustrated by the finding that children between the ages of 13 and 15, born\\nprior to the serotype 1 outbreak of 1978, had significantly more serotype 1-specific\\nIgA in their serum than serotype 2- or 3-specific IgA. We also found that parenteral\\nvaccination with IPV was able to boost IgA responses in 74% to 87% of a naturally\\nexposed population. While the presence of IgA in IPV-recipients has been previously\\ndocumented, our findings support the hypothesis that mucosal priming with live virus\\nis necessary to obtain an IgA response after IPV booster vaccination.\\nA group of fully OPV- or IPV-vaccinated recipients were given a booster vaccination\\nwith IPV to investigate the effect of IPV vaccination on the mucosal IgA response\\n(described in Chapter 5). ELISA and ELISPOT-assays were used for the detection of\\npoliovirus-specific IgA responses. No induction of poliovirus-specific IgA was\\ndetected in either saliva or stool samples from individuals in the IPV-vaccinated\\ngroup, and no IgA-producing cells could be detected in their blood. These findings led\\nto the conclusion that IPV vaccination is unable to induce a response to poliovirus at\\nthe mucosal level, indicating the possibility of a lower level of protection against\\n(re)infection in IPV recipients.\\nHowever, IPV did induce high levels of circulating IgA in fully OPV-vaccinated\\nsubjects at both the humoral and the mucosal level. When B cell populations were\\nseparated on the basis of the expression of mucosal (a4b7 integrin) or peripheral (L-selectin)\\nhoming receptors, a large percentage (77.3%) of the poliovirus-specific IgA-producing\\ncells in the previously OPV-vaccinated group expressed the a4b7 integrin.\\nIt was concluded that IPV vaccination alone is insufficient to induce a mucosal IgA\\nresponse against poliovirus. Our results did indicate, however, that IPV vaccination\\ncan serve as an excellent stimulator of mucosal immunity in mucosally (OPV) primed\\nindividuals. These observations indicate that the interpretation of findings from\\nchallenge studies using IPV recipients must take into account subjects\\x92 possible\\nprevious contact with live poliovirus. Subjects from endemic regions, for example,\\nmay have had previous exposure to live poliovirus, and this may explain the reported\\ninduction of mucosal IgA by IPV vaccination in the past [2,5,8,10,16,17,19].\\nCases of poliomyelitis in which paralysis occurs are very difficult to distinguish\\nclinically from other cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP). Several new diagnostic\\nmethods have been developed in recent years (in our laboratory and elsewhere) that\\nhave not been evaluated under field conditions [3,4,10,11,15,18]. While the\\nvirological investigation of stool samples is important, it is a laborious procedure [1].\\nThe detection of poliovirus serotype specific-IgM in AFP patients facilitates the\\nlaboratory diagnosis of poliomyelitis and helps to exclude poliovirus as the causative\\nagent (Chapter 6). In fact, virus-specific IgM was detected in the blood for six weeks\\nlonger than virus was able to be isolated from stool samples. Poliovirus-specific IgA?Summary\\n123\\npersisted in many patients for more than eight weeks after infection and may therefore\\nreflect past exposure rather than a recently acquired infection. For this reason,\\npoliovirus-specific IgA is less suitable for the diagnosis of recent infections.\\nReports of AFP cases in The Netherlands often succumb to serious delays. As a result,\\nAFP surveillance (in its present form) is not an adequate tool with which to document\\nthe absence of poliovirus. To make matters worse, only 18.6% of reported AFP cases\\nare virologically examined in The Netherlands (according to WHO guidelines [1,12]).\\nThis implies that poliovirus infection can not be excluded with certainty in 69% of\\nthese cases. The IgM ELISA will be helpful in resolving cases of AFP that cannot be\\nretrospectively classified as poliomyelitis and for which serum samples are available.\\nDespite all of the problems discussed above, we are well on our way to the world-wide\\neradication of poliovirus through the use of the currently available IPV and OPV\\nvaccines. Before vaccination stops, however, we must ensure that all (silent)\\ncirculation of poliovirus within vaccine recipients is terminated. Poliovirus infections\\nin vaccinated recipients are hard to detect, since none of these people will develop any\\nclinical signs. It is for this reason that the absence of clinical cases induced by\\npoliovirus in a vaccinated population can never serve as compelling evidence of\\npoliovirus eradication. More sensitive tools must be developed to ensure that\\npoliovirus transmission is halted in the vaccinated population.\\nWe were able to detect poliovirus-specific IgA in young IPV-vaccinated children,\\nindicating that they have never been in contact with live poliovirus. This is a clear\\nindication that we are on the right track towards the elimination of poliovirus from\\nThe Netherlands. We are only a short time away from a complete absence of\\npoliomyelitis outbreaks.?Summary\\n124\\nReferences\\n1. Conyn-van Spaendonck MAE, Geubbels ELPE, Suijkerbuijk AWM.

       "  'Description': ['Alle organen en weefsels van hogere organismen worden voorzien van voedingsstoffen en zuurstof door middel van het bloedvatstelsel. Het bloedvatstelsel is een uitgebreid systeem van vaten dat ervoor zorgt dat bloed naar alle organen en weefsels stroomt. Bloed bevat rode bloedcellen, witte bloedcellen, bloedplaatjes en plasma. Rode bloedcellen zorgen voor het transport van zuurstof van de longen naar de weefsels en van koolstofdioxide (een afvalprodukt uit de weefsels) van de weefsels naar de longen. Witte bloedcellen zorgen voor de afweer tegen micro-organismen. Plasma is de vloeistof waarin alle andere bestanddelen zijn opgelost en bevat hormonen en talloze eiwitten. Aangezien bloed een belangrijke functie heeft in de regulatie van lichaamstemperatuur, zuurstof voorziening van weefsels en het functioneren van cellen, is het behoud van het bloedvatstelsel van cruciaal belang. Bij verwonding treedt weefselschade op, en overtallig bloedverlies zou het gevolg zijn als er geen natuurlijk mechanisme zou zijn om het bloeden te stoppen. Om bloedingen te voorkomen, zijn er een aantal mechanismen die op gang komen bij weefselschade. Ten eerste trekken de bloedvaten samen op de plaats van beschadiging, waardoor er al minder bloedverlies op kan treden. Ten tweede hechten bloedplaatjes aan de vaatwand en vormen daarmee een plaatjesprop. Ten derde wordt een netwerk van fibrinedraden gevormd die de plaatjesprop verstevigt. De vorming van het fibrine netwerk wordt bloedstolling genoemd. Door verschillende mogelijke oorzaken wordt de bloedstolling soms onnodig op gang gebracht. Als gevolg daarvan vormt zich dan een bloedstolsel in een bloedvat waardoor het erachter liggende weefsel onvoldoende voorzien wordt van bloed: trombose. Trombose kan leiden tot weefselschade of zelfs weefselsterfte. Een verslechterde conditie van de bloedvaten of de aanwezigheid van overgevoelige bloedplaatjes kan leiden tot de vorming van een plaatjesprop doordat bloedplaatjes geactiveerd worden (bijvoorbeeld bij atherosclerose of aderverkalking). Wanneer de activatie van bloedplaatjes en/of bloedstolling achterwege blijft terwijl het juist wel nodig is, treden er bloedingen op. Hetzelfde is het geval als een bloedstolsel te snel wordt afgebroken (fibrinolyse). Het is dus duidelijk dat de bloedstelping (haemostase) heel nauwkeurig gereguleerd dient te worden. Er zijn vele stoornissen in de haemostase die tot trombotische of bloedings complicaties kunnen leiden.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is an autosomal, dominant inherited tumour syndrome. The disease is named after the German ophthalmologist Eugen\\n   von Hippel, who described retinal haemangioblastoma in 1904, and the Swedish pathologist Arvid Lindau who associated\\n   retinal and CNS haemangioblastoma with cysts of the kidneys, pancreas and epididymis in 1926. The estimated prevalence of\\n   the disease varies between 1:31,000 and 1:53,000 persons. Objectives The main objective of this thesis is to identify patients\\n   and families with VHL disease by molecular genetic analysis. Presymptomatic DNA analysis and identification of carriers of\\n   VHL germline mutations in families then permits tumour development to be followed from a relative early age, and optimises the\\n   time at which treatment is carried out. In addition, we collected clinical and genetic data to identify possible\\n   genotype-phenotype correlations and aimed to formulate national guidelines for diagnosis and periodic monitoring of VHL\\n   patients. Results and conclusions In order to prevent both patient and doctor delay in the diagnosis of VHL disease, persons at\\n   risk for the disease as well as doctors should be provided with clear oral and written information about the clinical and genetic\\n   aspects of the disease. In addition, an intercentre co-operation should be established between the medical specialists involved\\n   to prevent unnecessary morbidity and mortality in VHL patients. Multidisciplinary teams following national and international\\n   guidelines should guarantee the best results in the management of VHL patients. We demonstrate genotype-phenotype\\n   correlations for some tumours In VHL disease, but there appears to be no simple relationship between a germline mutation in\\n   the VHL gene and the manifestation of VHL-related tumours. For example, there is intrafamilial variability in the age of onset and\\n   the manifestation of different types of VHL-related tumours. Furthermore, we provide evidence non-penetrance of certain VHL\\n   germline mutations. We estimate that the prevalence of VHL disease in the Netherlands is 1:64,000 and will almost certainly\\n   prove to be higher. We demonstrate that 12% to 21% of the VHL germline mutations occur de novo. In addition, we illustrate\\n   that VHL germline mutations can be identified in sporadic patients with VHL-related tumours who do not meet the current\\n   diagnostic criteria. These findings emphasise the importance of screening sporadic patients with one or more typical\\n   VHL-related tumours for germline mutations in the VHL gene. A principal finding of this study is that the early detection of VHL\\n   families and patients using molecular genetic analysis is effective, assuming that annual monitoring and timely treatment leads\\n   to a better prognosis for VHL patients. However, regarding the early detection of VHL patients, we observe that: (1) there is\\n   insufficient evidence of an improved quality of life or a longer life span; (2) there is no reliable analysis of the\\n   cost-effectiveness; and (3) the psychological consequences have not been studied sufficiently. These three observations\\n   should provide a basis for further clinical investigations. More extensive genetic research is indicated for clinical situations\\n   suggesting the presence of VHL disease, but without a VHL germline mutation.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Aspects of intrathecal morphine for postoperative pain relief in major orthopedic surgery'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['The optimal site to administer opioids e.g. morphine is as close as possible to the opiate receptor site (spinal cord) by the intrathecal route, as it is the place of effectiveness. To improve the clinical effectiveness of intrathecal morphine two strategies\\n   are proposed: 1. to lower the intrathecal dose of morphine and thereby reduce the supraspinal adverse effects while maintaining\\n   the analgesic effects; 2. further research to synthesize highly selective endorphin mimetic drugs with a minimum of side effects.\\n   We hypothesized that low doses of intrathecal morphine might probably result in similar pain relief scores but might minimize\\n   the incidence of adverse effects. The first study was designed to determine the optimal intrathecal dose of morphine in total hip\\n   surgery. The optimal intrathecal dose was defined as the dose, which provides effective analgesia with minimal side effects\\n   during 24 h after total hip surgery. Patients (n=143) scheduled for total hip surgery were randomized to four double-blinded\\n   groups with a standardized bupivacaine dose but different doses of intrathecal morphine: group I, 0.025 mg; group II, 0.05 mg;\\n   group III, 0.1 mg; and, group IV, 0.2 mg. Pain scores, intravenous morphine intake {patient controlled analgesia (PCA)} and\\n   morphine related side effects (respiratory depression, postoperative nausea and vomiting, itching, urinary retention) were\\n   recorded for 24 h after surgery. Excellent postoperative pain relief was present in all groups. The highest pain scores were found\\n   in group I. The mean use of systemic morphine administered by PCA infusion pump was: 23.7 mg, 17.8 mg, 10.9 mg and 9.9 mg,\\n   in group I, II, III, and IV, respectively (p<0.01, group III and IV versus group I). We conclude that 0.1 mg intrathecal morphine is\\n   the optimal dose for pain relief after hip surgery with minimal side effects. A second study evaluated the questions: firstly, to\\n   what extent do spinal opiates contribute to PONV (post operative nausea and vomiting); and, secondly, how effectively can\\n   metoclopramide reduce the incidence of PONV after intrathecal administration of morphine. All patients were scheduled to\\n   undergo major joint surgery of the lower limb. The patients were allocated to three groups. Group I (n=200): intrathecal\\n   anesthesia was induced by administration of 20 mg bupivacaine and 0.2 mg morphine. Group II (n=100): intrathecal anesthesia\\n   was induced using the same dosages and drugs for intrathecal anesthesia, but in addition systemic metoclopramide was\\n   injected in two doses of 20 mg. Finally, for patients in group III (n=100) intrathecal anesthesia was induced by the\\n   administration of 20 mg bupivacaine only. The maximum PONV percentages were 41.1%, 32.7% and 37% in group I, II and III\\n   respectively. The consumption of antiemetics was similar in all groups. The number of patients who needed one or more\\n   additional antiemetics during the first 24 hours after surgery was 112 (56.6%), 57 (58%) and 60 (60%) in group I, II and III,\\n   respectively. Administration of metoclopramide did not reduce the overall incidence of PONV. Our study shows no relationship\\n   between the use of 0.2 mg intrathecal morphine and the incidence of PONV during 24 hours postoperatively. The third study\\n   was designed to determine whether low doses of intrathecal morphine still result in itching and it evaluates the outcome of\\n   using standardized treatment with promethazine and - for intractable itch - naloxon. Patients (n=143) scheduled for total hip\\n   surgery were randomized to four double-blinded groups with a standardized bupivacaine dose but different doses of intrathecal\\n   morphine: group I, 0.025 mg; group II, 0.05 mg; group III, 0.1 mg; and, group IV, 0.2 mg (same patients as Chapter 3). The\\n   presence or absence of itching was noted every three hours for a twenty-four hour period. When requested by the patient, the\\n   standard procedure for treatment was initiated. The incidence of itching was: Group I: 14.3%; Group II: 21.6%; Group III: 48.6%;\\n   and, Group IV: 61.7%. Itch was treated by administering promethazine intramuscularly in 2,9% (Group I); 8,1% (Group II); 10.8%\\n   (Group III); and, 8.9% (Group IV) respectively. Only in group IV there was 1 patient who needed naloxon to treat itching. The\\n   incidence and severity of itching is a dose related side effect in the dose range of 0.025 \\x96 0.2 mg of intrathecal morphine. Itching\\n   even occurs after the low doses of intrathecal morphine, but symptoms vanish after promethazine 25 mg intramuscularly.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The diagnostic difficulties, variability in outcome and the heterogeinity of the problem of orthopaedic infections stimulated the author to a study of the literature, and several clinical and experimental studies. The diagnosis prosthesis-related infection can\\n   only be reached with an acceptable degree of certainty by combination of clinical, laboratory and imaging investigations.\\n   Fourty-seven patients with a prosthetic hip infection treated in our hospital were retrospectively divided into three treatment\\n   groups: I debridement and retention of the original components, II resection arthroplasty and III removal of the prosthesis\\n   followed by immediate or staged reimplantation. Two patiens died because of the infection. The infection was succesfully\\n   eradicated initially in 44%, 73% and 94% of the patients, respectively. Removal of the prosthesis is superior for eradication of\\n   the infection, but the functional outcome of the resection arthroplasty is poor. For better functional results, an exchange of the\\n   prosthesis, when possible, is advised. To emphasise the haematogenous route as an important pathway for orthopaedic\\n   infections, a retrospective analysis of 28 children with an osteomyelitis was performed. The patients were evaluated by chart\\n   review. All children were treated surgically and treated with antibiotics subsequently. In addition to surgical intervention, six\\n   weeks of antibiotic therapy appears to be sufficient to eradicate acute as well as chronic osteomyelitis in children. In a clinical\\n   case report the development and course of a haematogenous hip prosthesis infection after an acute cholecystitis is described.\\n   A Clostridium perfringens was isolated from the infected gallbladder and after several months of the prosthesis. If patiens of a\\n   total joint prosthesis develop bacterial infections at distant sites, they should be treated immediately and aggresively with\\n   antibiotics to prevent haematogenous spread to the prosthetic joint. The so-called \"race for the surface\" theory, as postulated\\n   by Gristina, suggests competition between tissue and bacterial cells for implant material surfaces. If bacteria arrive first at the\\n   surface and colonise the biomaterial, an infection will develop. In an experimental animal study the question whether there is a\\n   difference in infection suspectibility of two common orthopaedic implant surfaces with a different biocompatibility (grit-blasted\\n   Ti6A14V and hydroxyapatite coated Ti6A14V) was addressed. Prior to implantation the left tibia of a rabbit was contaminated\\n   with increasing concentrations of Staphylococcus aureus. After sacrifice, bone adjecent to the implant was harvested for\\n   bacteriological, histological and histomorphometrical examination and quantification. Bacteriology and histology showed more\\n   severe infection for the HA implants as compared to the Ti implants. Histomorphometry confirms a relationship between implant\\n   loosening and infection. The results suggest that the \"race for the surface theory\" should be reconsidered for the more complex\\n   in vivo situation. Also the development of an experimental animal model to study haematogenous infections of cementless\\n   implants is described. A cylindrical Ti6A14V or hydroxyapatite coated Ti6A14V implant was inserted into the right tibia of\\n   rabbits. After at least 4 weeks, the implants were contaminated through selective angiography with varying doses of\\n   Staphylococcus aureus (Wood 46). After sacrifice, at least after 1 week, biopsies of bone were cultured. Injection of 5x10 8\\n   colony forming units caused positive cultures in all cases and minimal systemetic reactions. This model is used for further\\n   studies of haematogenous implant infections.'],\n",

Perhaps this can be attributed to\\r\\nthe fact that, contrary to many other phenomena, X-rays lend themselves naturally\\r\\nfor registration by means of materials and methods widely available at the time of\\r\\ntheir discovery | a fact that gave X-ray based medical imaging an at least 50-year\\r\\nhead start over possible alternatives. Immediately after the preliminary communica-\\r\\ntion on the discovery of the \\\\new light\" by R¨ ontgen [317], late December 1895, the\\r\\npossible applications of X-rays were investigated intensively. In 1896 alone, almost\\r\\none 1,000 articles about the new phenomenon appeared in print (Glasser [119] lists\\r\\nall of them). Although most of the basics of the diagnostic as well as the therapeutic\\r\\nuses of X-rays had been worked out by the end of that year [289], research on im-\\r\\nproved acquisition and reduction of potential risks for humans continued steadily in\\r\\nthe century to follow. The development of improved X-ray tubes, rapid lm changers,\\r\\nimage intensiers, the introduction of television cameras into uoroscopy, and com-\\r\\nputers in digital radiography and computerized tomography, formed a succession of\\r\\nachievements which increased the diagnostic potential of X-ray based imaging.\\r\\nOne of the areas in medical imaging where X-rays have always played an im-\\r\\nportant role is angiography,y which concerns the visualization of blood vessels in the\\r\\nhuman body.

Of special interest in the context of this thesis is\\r\\nthe improvement brought by photographic subtraction, a technique known since the\\r\\nearly 1900s and since then used successfully in e.g. astronomy, but rst introduced\\r\\nin X-ray angiography in 1934, by Ziedses des Plantes [425, 426]. This technique al-\\r\\nlowed for a considerable enhancement of vessel visibility by cancellation of unwanted\\r\\nbackground structures. In the 1960s, the time consuming lm subtraction process\\r\\nwas replaced by analog video subtraction techniques [156, 275] which, with the in-\\r\\ntroduction of digital computers, gave rise to the development of digital subtraction\\r\\nangiography [194] | a technique still considered by many the \\\\gold standard\" for de-\\r\\ntection and quantication of vascular anomalies. Today, research on improved X-ray\\r\\nbased imaging techniques for angiography continues, witness the recent developments\\r\\nin three-dimensional rotational angiography [88, 185, 186, 341,373].\\r\\nThe subject of this thesis is enhancement of digital X-ray angiography images. In\\r\\ncontrast with the previously mentioned developments, the emphasis is not on the\\r\\nfurther improvement of image acquisition techniques, but rather on the development\\r\\nand evaluation of digital image processing techniques for retrospective enhancement\\r\\nof images acquired with existing techniques. In the context of this thesis, the term\\r\\n\\\\enhancement\" must be regarded in a rather broad sense. It does not only refer\\r\\nto improvement of image quality by reduction of disturbing artifacts and noise, but\\r\\nalso to minimization of possible image quality degradation and loss of quantitative\\r\\ninformation, inevitably introduced by required image processing operations. These\\r\\ntwo aspects of image enhancement will be claried further in a brief summary of each\\r\\nof the chapters of this thesis.\\r\\nThe rst three chapters deal with the problem of patient motion artifacts in digital\\r\\nsubtraction angiography (DSA). In DSA imaging, a sequence of 2D digital X-ray\\r\\nprojection images is acquired, at a rate of e.g. two per second, following the injection\\r\\nof contrast material into one of the arteries or veins feeding the part of the vasculature\\r\\nto be diagnosed. Acquisition usually starts about one or two seconds prior to arrival\\r\\nof the contrast bolus in the vessels of interest, so that the rst few images included\\r\\nin the sequence do not show opacied vessels. In a subsequent post-processing step,\\r\\none of these \\\\pre-bolus\" images is then subtracted automatically from each of the\\r\\ncontrast images so as to mask out background structures such as bone and soft-\\r\\ntissue shadows. However, it is clear that in the resulting digital subtraction images,\\r\\nthe unwanted background structures will have been removed completely only when\\r\\nthe patient lied perfectly still during acquisition of the original images. Since most\\r\\npatients show at least some physical reaction to the passage of a contrast medium, this\\r\\nproviso is generally not met. As a result, DSA images frequently show patient-motion\\r\\ninduced artifacts (see e.g. the bottom-left image in Fig. 1.1), which may in uence the\\r\\nsubsequent analysis and diagnosis carried out by radiologists.\\r\\nSince the introduction of DSA, in the early 1980s, many solutions to the problem\\r\\nof patient motion artifacts have been put forward. Chapter 2 presents an overview\\r\\nof the possible types of motion artifacts reported in the literature and the techniques\\r\\nthat have been proposed to avoid them. The main purpose of that chapter is to\\r\\nreview and discuss the techniques proposed over the past two decades to correct for 1 Introduction and Summary 3\\r\\nFigure 1.1. Example of creation and reduction of patient motion artifacts in\\r\\ncerebral DSA imaging. Top left: a \\\\pre-bolus\" or mask image acquired just prior\\r\\nto the arrival of the contrast medium. Top right: one of the contrast or live images\\r\\nshowing opacied vessels. Bottom left: DSA image obtained after subtraction of\\r\\nthe mask from the contrast image, followed by contrast enhancement. Due to patient\\r\\nmotion, the background structures in the mask and contrast image were not perfectly\\r\\naligned, as a result of which the DSA image does not only show blood vessels, but\\r\\nalso additional undesired structures (in this example primarily in the bottom-left\\r\\npart of the image). Bottom right: DSA image resulting from subtraction of the\\r\\nmask and contast image after application of the automatic registration algorithm\\r\\ndescribed in Chapter 3. 4 1 Introduction and Summary\\r\\npatient motion artifacts retrospectively, by means of digital image processing. The\\r\\nchapter addresses fundamental problems, such as whether it is possible to construct\\r\\na 2D geometrical transformation that exactly describes the projective eects of an\\r\\noriginally 3D transformation, as well as practical problems, such as how to retrieve\\r\\nthe correspondence between mask and contrast images by using only the grey-level\\r\\ninformation contained in the images, and how to align the images according to that\\r\\ncorrespondence in a computationally ecient manner.\\r\\nThe review in Chapter 2 reveals that there exists quite some literature on the\\r\\ntopic of (semi-)automatic image alignment, or image registration, for the purpose of\\r\\nmotion artifact reduction in DSA images. However, to the best of our knowledge,\\r\\nresearch in this area has never led to algorithms which are suciently fast and robust\\r\\nto be acceptable for routine use in clinical practice. By drawing upon the suggestions\\r\\nput forward in Chapter 2, a new approach to automatic registration of digital X-ray\\r\\nangiography images is presented in Chapter 3. Apart from describing the functionality\\r\\nof the components of the algorithm, special attention is paid to their computationally\\r\\noptimal implementation. The results of preliminary experiments described in that\\r\\nchapter indicate that the algorithm is eective, very fast, and outperforms alterna-\\r\\ntive approaches, in terms of both image quality and required computation time. It is\\r\\nconcluded that the algorithm is most eective in cerebral and peripheral DSA imag-\\r\\ning. An example of the image quality enhancement obtained after application of the\\r\\nalgorithm in the case of a cerebral DSA image is provided in Fig 1.1.\\r\\nChapter 4 reports on a clinical evaluation of the automatic registration technique.\\r\\nThe evaluation involved 104 cerebral DSA images, which were corrected for patient\\r\\nmotion artifacts by the automatic technique, as well as by pixel shifting | a manual\\r\\ncorrection technique currently used in clinical practice. The quality of the DSA images\\r\\nresulting from the two techniques was assessed by four observers, who compared the\\r\\nimages both mutually and to the corresponding original images. The results of the\\r\\nevaluation presented in Chapter 4 indicate that the dierence in performance between\\r\\nthe two correction techniques is statistically signicant. From the results of the mutual\\r\\ncomparisons it is concluded that, on average, the automatic registration technique\\r\\nperforms either comparably, better than, or even much better than manual pixel\\r\\nshifting in 95% of all cases. In the other 5% of the cases, the remaining artifacts are\\r\\nlocated near the borders of the image, which are generally diagnostically non-relevant.\\r\\nIn addition, the results show that the automatic technique implies a considerable\\r\\nreduction of post-processing time compared to manual pixel shifting (on average, one\\r\\nsecond versus 12 seconds per DSA image).\\r\\nThe last two chapters deal with somewhat dierent topics. Chapter 5 is concerned\\r\\nwith visualization and quantication of vascular anomalies in three-dimensional rota-\\r\\ntional angiography (3DRA). Similar to DSA imaging, 3DRA involves the acquisition\\r\\nof a sequence of 2D digital X-ray projection images, following a single injection of\\r\\ncontrast material. Contrary to DSA, however, this sequence is acquired during a 180\\r\\nrotation of the C-arch on which the X-ray source and detector are mounted antipo-\\r\\ndally, with the object of interest positioned in its iso-center. The rotation is completed\\r\\nin about eight seconds and the resulting image sequence typically contains 100 images,\\r\\nwhich form the input to a ltered back-projection algorithm for 3D reconstruction. In\\r\\ncontrast with most other 3D medical imaging techniques, 3DRA is capable of provid- 1 Introduction and Summary 5\\r\\nFigure 1.2.

The visualizations were obtained by using the exact same settings\\r\\nfor the parameters of the volume rendering algorithm.\\r\\ning high-resolution isotropic datasets. However, due to the relatively high noise level\\r\\nand the presence of other unwanted background variations caused by surrounding\\r\\ntissue, the use of noise reduction techniques is inevitable in order to obtain smooth\\r\\nvisualizations of these datasets (see Fig. 1.2). Chapter 5 presents an inquiry into the\\r\\neects of several linear and nonlinear noise reduction techniques on the visualization\\r\\nand subsequent quantication of vascular anomalies in 3DRA images. The evalua-\\r\\ntion is focussed on frequently occurring anomalies such as a narrowing (or stenosis)\\r\\nof the internal carotid artery or a circumscribed dilation (or aneurysm) of intracra-\\r\\nnial arteries. Experiments on anthropomorphic vascular phantoms indicate that, of\\r\\nthe techniques considered, edge-enhancing anisotropic diusion ltering is most suit-\\r\\nable, although the practical use of this technique may currently be limited due to its\\r\\nmemory and computation-time requirements.\\r\\nFinally, Chapter 6 addresses the problem of interpolation of sampled data, which\\r\\noccurs e.g. when applying geometrical transformations to digital medical images for\\r\\nthe purpose of registration or visualization. In most practical situations, interpola-\\r\\ntion of a sampled image followed by resampling of the resulting continuous image\\r\\non a geometrically transformed grid, inevitably implies loss of grey-level information,\\r\\nand hence image degradation, the amount of which is dependent on image content,\\r\\nbut also on the employed interpolation scheme (see Fig. 1.3). It follows that the\\r\\nchoice for a particular interpolation scheme is important, since it in uences the re-\\r\\nsults of registrations and visualizations, and the outcome of subsequent quantitative\\r\\nanalyses which rely on grey-level information contained in transformed images. Al-\\r\\nthough many interpolation techniques have been developed over the past decades, 6 1 Introduction and Summary\\r\\nFigure 1.3.

Although it is not possible with\\r\\nsuch a comparison to come to conclusions as to which of the two methods yields\\r\\nthe smallest loss of grey-level information, this example clearly illustrates the point\\r\\nthat dierent interpolation methods usually yield dierent results.\\r\\nthorough quantitative evaluations and comparisons of these techniques for medical\\r\\nimage transformation problems are still lacking. Chapter 6 presents such a compar-\\r\\native evaluation. The study is limited to convolution-based interpolation techniques,\\r\\nas these are most frequently used for registration and visualization of medical image\\r\\ndata. Because of the ubiquitousness of interpolation in medical image processing and\\r\\nanalysis, the study is not restricted to XRA and 3DRA images, but also includes\\r\\ndatasets from many other modalities. It is concluded that for all modalities, spline\\r\\ninterpolation constitutes the best trade-o between accuracy and computational cost,\\r\\nand therefore is to be preferred over all other methods.\\r\\nIn summary, this thesis is concerned with the improvement of image quality and the\\r\\nreduction of image quality degradation and loss of quantitative information. The\\r\\nsubsequent chapters describe techniques for reduction of patient motion artifacts in\\r\\nDSA images, noise reduction techniques for improved visualization and quantication\\r\\nof vascular anomalies in 3DRA images, and interpolation techniques for the purpose\\r\\nof accurate geometrical transformation of medical image data. The results and con-\\r\\nclusions of the evaluations described in this thesis provide general guidelines for the\\r\\napplicability and practical use of these techniques.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The series of studies captured in this thesis have one common source, a prospective, open label, follow-up study to evaluate patterns of use, safety and effectiveness of the PPI lansoprazole in 10,008 naturally occurring patients in the Netherlands\\r\\n   (1994-1998). Clinical record forms and medication histories of this cohort have been completed representing in total 35,000\\r\\n   users-months of follow-up. The study was designed and performed according to the SAMM guidelines. Briefly, this means no\\r\\n   additional in- or exclusion criteria with respect to patient enrolment in the study, a modest remuneration for participating\\r\\n   physicians and, most importantly, a separation in time between the moment of prescription of the study drug (i.e. lansoprazole)\\r\\n   and the moment of inclusion of the patient in the study in order to avoid seeding prescriptions. What have we learned from all\\r\\n   this? A primary interest of the study was to evaluate patterns of use of lansoprazole. The drug has been used for a variety of\\r\\n   indications, frequently also beyond the official labelling of peptic ulcer and reflux oesophagitis. The study on the seeding of\\r\\n   prescriptions revealed that in the limited number of cases when seeding was there, this occurred most likely in patients with\\r\\n   relatively minor peptic disorders, including unlicensed indications. One out of five lansoprazole prescriptions was NSAID\\r\\n   related. The use of corticosteroids, anticoagulants, female gender and an age between 45 and 70 years were strongly associated\\r\\n   with NSAIDs induced PPI-use. The medley of prescribed eradication schedules and the large variety in pre- and post-testing of\\r\\n   the existence of H. pylori confirmed the great need of guidelines and protocols to ensure treatment success. It was a peculiar\\r\\n   finding that many patients with H. pylori eradication continued lansoprazole treatment (41.1%). Even one out of three peptic\\r\\n   ulcer patients without GERD and treated with triple or quadruple therapies had continued PPI use after H. pylori eradication\\r\\n   therapy. Regarding safety, we found that 17.4% of all studied patients reported adverse events. No unlabelled events were\\r\\n   detected. The profile and frequency of occurrence were analogous to results of clinical trials and other observational studies.\\r\\n   The reporting rates of adverse effects decreased in time. We found that certain patients had a higher risk to develop adverse\\r\\n   events, namely women, alcohol consumers, OTC-users and patients with co-morbidity. The occurrence of headache was\\r\\n   associated with female gender, a history of analgesics use and the tendency of reporting other adverse events as well. The\\r\\n   onset of diarrhoea during PPI use was related with the reporting of other adverse events, alcohol use and the concomitant use\\r\\n   of antibiotics, an important finding for ensuring treatment compliance with H. pylori eradication schemes including antibiotics.\\r\\n   We found that indication-related complaints disappeared or improved in 90.5% of patients after 8 weeks of lansoprazole use.\\r\\n   The effectiveness was comparable to results found in clinical trials in the registered indications for lansoprazole and high taking\\r\\n   into account the fact that patients were only endoscopically examined in 50.3%, that 29% of the patients had not licensed\\r\\n   indications and that patients with complex morbidity were included. We were able to gain more in depth insight in the patterns\\r\\n   of use of a new drug launched on the Dutch market. Peptic Survey was designed as a field follow-up study bringing data from\\r\\n   various sources together in one research database. This approach is most appealing when prescribing of a new drug is highly\\r\\n   variable at the moment of product launch in the market place and when drug exposure is not covered sufficiently yet by\\r\\n   automated databases. A main concern remains the costs and time burden of building such large cohorts of recipients of a new\\r\\n   drug in the market. Industry will continue to play a major role in funding these studies. A critical appraisal of a possible conflict\\r\\n   of interest remains necessary. The postmarketing project described in this thesis represents certainly no panacea for solving all\\r\\n   problems, but has surely contributed to the knowledge base of conducting sound postmarketing studies of new drugs.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Het humaan immuundeficiëntie virus (HIV) is de veroorzaker van het verworven immuundeficiëntie syndroom (Acquired Immunodeficiency\\r\\nSyndrome, AIDS). Een infectie met HIV leidt tot een afname van het\\r\\naantal CD4 + T cellen. Deze cellen spelen een centrale rol bij de afweer van\\r\\nhet lichaam tegen ziekmakende micro-organismen, zoals gisten,\\r\\nschimmels, bacteriën en virussen. De CD4 + T cellen worden wel de helper\\r\\ncellen van het afweer systeem genoemd. Afname van het aantal helper\\r\\ncellen door een HIV infectie maakt het afweersysteem minder effectief en\\r\\nuiteindelijk ontwikkelt zich bij de meeste HIV geïnfecteerde patiënten\\r\\nAIDS.\\r\\nDe schadelijke werking die HIV uitoefent op het afweersysteem kan\\r\\nafgeremd worden door behandeling met een combinatie van HIV\\r\\nremmers. Deze geneesmiddelen worden ook wel antiretrovirale\\r\\ngeneesmiddelen genoemd. HIV is immers een zogenaamd retrovirus. In de\\r\\nkliniek worden op het ogenblik twee typen antiretrovirale middelen\\r\\ngebruikt, die elk een specifiek enzym van HIV remmen: protease remmers\\r\\nen reverse transcriptase remmers. In dit proefschrift worden onderzoeken\\r\\nbeschreven naar het effect van deze combinaties (\\x93cocktails\\x94) van\\r\\nantiretrovirale geneesmiddelen op de replicatie (vermenigvuldiging) van\\r\\nHIV en het naar het herstel van het afweersysteem tijdens zo\\x92n combinatie\\r\\ntherapie.\\r\\nDe hoofdstukken\\r\\nAls inleiding op dit proefschrift wordt in hoofdstuk 1 een overzicht\\r\\ngegeven van de huidige kennis over de pathogenese van HIV infectie en de\\r\\neffecten van antiretrovirale therapie.\\r\\nHoofdstuk 2 beschrijft de CHEESE studie. CHEESE staat voor\\r\\nComparative trial in HIV infected patients Evaluating Efficacy and Safety\\r\\nof saquinavir Enhanced oral formulation and indinavir given as part of a?triple therapy. In deze studie werd de antiretrovirale effectiviteit en de\\r\\nbijwerkingen van twee combinatie therapieën met elkaar vergeleken, te\\r\\nweten een combinatie van saquinavir soft-gelatin-capsules (SGC) +\\r\\nzidovudine (AZT) + lamivudine (3TC) versus een combinatie van\\r\\nindinavir + AZT + 3TC (de standaard therapie toen de studie werd\\r\\ngestart). Het was de eerste studie waarin twee protease remmers\\r\\n(saquinavir en indinavir) met elkaar vergeleken werden, toegediend in\\r\\ncombinatie met dezelfde reverse transcriptase remmers. Het was een\\r\\ngerandomiseerde, \\x93open label\\x94 studie (dus iedereen wist welke medicatie er\\r\\nna loting aan de patiënten toegediend werd), uitgevoerd in 8 ziekenhuizen\\r\\nin Nederland. In totaal namen er 70 HIV geïnfecteerde (volwassen)\\r\\npatiënten deel aan de studie, 35 in elke arm. De patiënten waren voor het\\r\\nbegin van deze studie nooit behandeld met HIV remmers.\\r\\nDe antiretrovirale effectiviteit van beide therapie armen was niet\\r\\nverschillend na 24 weken en na 48 weken therapie. In beide\\r\\nbehandelarmen van de studie was een snelle afname van het aantal virus\\r\\ndeeltjes in het plasma waarneembaar. Na 24 weken therapie was het\\r\\npercentage patiënten met minder dan 50 kopieën HIV RNA (het\\r\\ngenetisch materiaal van HIV) per milliliter plasma 74.3% in de saquinavir\\r\\ngroep en 71.4% in de indinavir groep. Dit verschil is niet significant. De\\r\\ntoename van het aantal CD4 + T cellen in de eerste 24 weken was hoger in\\r\\nde saquinavir-SGC groep dan in de indinavir groep (162±20 VS. 89±21\\r\\ncellen per mm3). Echter, na 32 weken therapie was geen verschil in het\\r\\nCD4 getal meer aantoonbaar was tussen beide therapie armen.\\r\\nDe soft-gel-capsules van saquinavir zijn ontwikkeld omdat de\\r\\noorspronkelijke toedieningsvorm van saquinavir, de hard-gel-capsules, een\\r\\nlage biologische beschikbaarheid heeft van slechts 4% (het wordt niet goed\\r\\nopgenomen in het lichaam). In hoofdstuk 3 is onderzocht of gebruik van\\r\\nde saquinavir soft-gel-capsules leidt tot hogere saquinavir spiegels in\\r\\nplasma bij patiënten dan bij gebruik van de hard-gel-capsules. Een hogere\\r\\nbiologische beschikbaarheid van de soft-gel-capsules ten opzichte van de\\r\\nhard gel capsules kon niet aangetoond worden. Tevens kon geen relatie\\r\\naangetoond worden tussen de saquinavir spiegels in het plasma van de\\r\\npatiënten en de antiretrovirale repons gedurende 48 weken therapie.\\r\\n205\\r\\nhoofdstuk 11 9/21/00 1:12 PM Pagina 205?In hoofdstuk 4 en hoofdstuk 5 is de relatie onderzocht tussen de leeftijd\\r\\nvan HIV geïnfecteerde patiënten en de regeneratie (de heraanmaak) van\\r\\nnieuwe T cellen gedurende antiretrovirale combinatie therapie. Nieuwe T\\r\\ncellen worden aangemaakt in de thymus (zwezerik). Dit is een orgaan dat\\r\\nvlak bij het hart ligt. Nieuwe T cellen worden ook wel naïeve T cellen\\r\\ngenoemd omdat ze nooit in aanraking zijn geweest met lichaamsvreemd\\r\\nmateriaal (antigeen). Een infectie met HIV leidt tot een afname van het\\r\\naantal naïeve T cellen waardoor de afweer tegen nieuwe infecties\\r\\ngecompromitteerd kan worden. Onze hypothese was dat de snelheid\\r\\nwaarmee het aantal naïeve T cellen toeneemt tijdens antiretrovirale\\r\\ncombinatie therapie afneemt met de leeftijd, omdat de thymus kleiner\\r\\nwordt als iemand ouder wordt. De snelheid van naïeve T-cel aanmaak\\r\\nbleek inderdaad omgekeerd evenredig te zijn met de leeftijd van de\\r\\npatiënten. Dit geldt zowel voor kinderen in de leeftijdscategorie van 0-16\\r\\njaar (hoofdstuk 4) als voor volwassenen van 25 tot 56 jaar (hoofdstuk 5).\\r\\nIn hoofdstuk 6 is onderzocht of de productie van naïeve T cellen door de\\r\\nthymus is verminderd in HIV geïnfecteerde patiënten. Door sommige\\r\\nonderzoekers is gesteld dat De T-cel productie van de thymus bepaald kan\\r\\nworden door het aantal T cellen te meten die recent de thymus verlaten\\r\\nhebben. Deze nieuwe T cellen kan men herkennen aan de aanwezigheid\\r\\nvan een T-cel receptor excisie cirkel (TREC). Deze TRECs zijn\\r\\ncirkelvormige stukjes DNA die ontstaan bij het T-cel rijpingsproces in de\\r\\nthymus, tijdens de vorming van de antigeen receptor van de T cel. Een\\r\\ninfectie met HIV leidt tot een afname van het aantal T cellen dat TRECs\\r\\nbevat. Gebruik makend van een wiskundig model hebben wij aangetoond\\r\\ndat de verlaging van het aantal TREC positieve T cellen tijdens HIV\\r\\ninfectie beter verklaard kan worden door de toename van deling van de\\r\\nnaïeve T cellen dan door een vermindering van de thymus functie.\\r\\nIn hoofdstuk 7 en hoofdstuk 8 is de activatie en deling van T cellen\\r\\nonderzocht in onbehandelde HIV geïnfecteerde patiënten en in patiënten\\r\\ntijdens combinatie therapie. Een infectie met HIV leidt tot een toename in\\r\\nde activatie en deling van T cellen. Deze T-cel hyperactivatie kan verklaard\\r\\nworden met twee modellen. Volgens het eerste model is de hyperactivatie\\r\\nhet gevolg van een gegeneraliseerde immuunactivatie, veroorzaakt door\\r\\nSAMENVATTING IN HET NEDERLANDS 206\\r\\nhoofdstuk 11 9/21/00 1:12 PM Pagina 206?antigenen van HIV zelf, en van andere pathogenen (bijvoorbeeld van\\r\\nopportunistische pathogenen). Volgens het andere model is de toegenomen\\r\\nactivatie en deling van T cellen tijdens HIV infectie het gevolg van een\\r\\nregelmechanisme van het afweersysteem, dat probeert de afname van het\\r\\naantal CD4 + T cellen door HIV te compenseren (een homeostatische\\r\\nrespons). In hoofdstuk 7 en hoofdstuk 8 is geprobeerd uit te maken welk\\r\\nvan deze twee modellen het beste de T cel hyperactivatie verklaart.\\r\\nStimulatie door antigenen lijkt de beste verklaring voor de T-cel\\r\\nhyperactivatie in HIV infecties.\\r\\nBij een meerderheid van de patiënten leidt krachtige antiretrovirale\\r\\ncombinatie therapie tot een zodanige onderdrukking van HIV dat geen\\r\\nHIV RNA kopieën in het plasma meer aantoonbaar is, althans minder dan\\r\\n50 kopieeen per milliliter. Echter, nadat het virus eenmaal ondetecteerbaar\\r\\nis geworden in het plasma tijdens combinatie therapie, vinden bij een\\r\\naanzienlijk deel van de patiënten (tot 40%) kortdurende perioden van HIV\\r\\nviremie plaats. Deze perioden van viremie heten hebben wij \\x93blips\\x94\\r\\ngenoemd. Het doel van de studie in hoofdstuk 9 was om te bepalen of\\r\\ndeze blips geassocieerd zijn met de ontwikkeling van resistentie van HIV\\r\\ntegen combinatie therapie. Bij een meerderheid van de patiënten met een\\r\\nblip was HIV resistentie aantoonbaar op genetisch niveau.\\r\\nHoofdstuk 10 is de algemene discussie.\\r\\n207\\r\\nhoofdstuk 11 9/21/00 1:12 PM Pagina 207?SAMENVATTING IN HET NEDERLANDS 208\\r\\nhoofdstuk 11 9/21/00 1:12 PM Pagina 208'],\n",

All other types of aortic valve substitutes are\\nalso described and their main advantages and disadvantages are mentioned. Finally, the\\naim of the present thesis is defined.\\nChapter 2 studies the durability of bicuspid aortic valve repair for prolapsing leaflet.\\nNinety-four patients were operated over an 8-year period with a mean follow-up of 5 years.\\nSuccessful repair was more difficult to achieve in dilated ventricles. A total of 12 patients\\nunderwent reoperation. In three of them, the aortic valve was re-repairable. The risk of\\nreoperation was highest the first postoperative year and then relatively constant at 2% per\\nyear. The overall freedom from aortic valve reoperation was 84% at 7 years. The repair\\nwas less durable in patients with residual aortic regurgitation after the initial procedure.\\nChapter 3 examines the results of valve repair in tricuspid aortic valves with leaflet\\nprolapse. The repair was attempted in 33 patients but failed immediately in five. During\\na mean follow-up of 4 years, three more patients required aortic valve replacement. The\\nfreedom from aortic valve reoperation after successful initial repair was 83% at 5 years.\\nThe size of the patient group and the number of events were too small to detect risk factors\\nfor repair failure.\\nChapter 4 is an analysis of the results of aortic valve preservation during surgical\\nintervention for acute Type A aortic dissection with involvement of the aortic root. From\\n1976 to 1999, 121 patients were operated with various techniques for aortic root\\nreconstruction and followed for a mean of almost 4 years. Ten percent of the patient\\npopulation underwent aortic valve replacement during follow-up but only one was due to\\nintrinsic aortic valve pathology. Nine reoperations were due to aortic root dilatation. The\\nuse of fibrinous glue for aortic root reconstruction and the presence of an aortic valve\\nannulus > 27mm were associated with a statistically significant higher incidence of aortic\\nroot reoperation. There was a trend towards better durability using GRF-glue® over\\nTeflon® felt for aortic root reconstruction.\\nChapter 5 describes the initial St. Antonius Hospital experience with the aortic valve\\nreimplantation technique as published by David. The technique replaces the aortic root\\nwith the exception of the aortic valve. Indications include aneurismal disease of the aortic\\nroot or ascending aorta but also aortic wall destruction due to aortic dissection, all\\ncomplicated by (severe) aortic regurgitation.

       "  'Description': ['The general aim of this thesis was to investigate the value and the shortcomings\\nof the becquerel-per-gram method for radioiodine therapy in various benign\\nthyroid disorders. The history of this treatment form, which goes back to the\\nlate 1940s, is described in Chapter 1. Almost fifty years after the discovery of\\nradioactivity, the first clinical experiences with 131 I-treatment were reported in\\nthe United States. A simple and effective treatment form had emerged as an\\nalternative to surgery and antithyroid drug (ATD) therapy in Graves\\x92 disease.\\nThe efficacy of radioiodine was initially tested \\x96 and demonstrated \\x96 in patients\\nwho could not be cured with ATD medication. With increasing experience in the\\nmanagement of Graves\\x92 disease, it became apparent that the outcome of radio-iodine\\ntreatment was difficult to predict. No more than half of all patients treated\\nbecame euthyroid with one 131 I administration. Higher or lower dosage protocols\\nmade the difference for the outcome in the other 50%. In other words, there\\nwas the choice between a greater risk of early hypothyroidism or persistent hyper-thyroidism.\\nThe development of different schools with regard to the desired\\ntherapy outcome (i.e., rapid cure of hyperthyroidism, or restoring euthyroidism)\\ndid not hamper the furthering of radioiodine therapy. By the late 1980s,\\nradioiodine had replaced surgery as the first choice for the curation of Graves\\x92\\nhyperthyroidism, toxic adenoma and toxic multinodular goiter.\\nAfter this introduction, a number of items relevant to radioiodine treat-ment\\nare reviewed: the physical and radiobiologic properties of iodine-131; pros\\nand cons of different therapeutic aims; and factors influencing the outcome of\\nradioiodine therapy. A statement of the aims of this thesis concludes Chapter 1.\\nIn Chapter 2, we present the clinical follow-up results of radioiodine treatment\\nin patients with toxic adenoma and in patients with toxic multinodular goiter.\\nThe prevalence of both these disorders is relatively low in comparison with dif-fuse\\ntoxic goiter (Graves\\x92 disease), and consequently the number of cases in-cluded\\nin this investigation is limited. Because of their similar histopathologic\\nand clinical profiles, they have been studied as one group. A standardized dos-age\\nof 3.7 MBq per gram thyroid tissue was applied in patients with multinodu-lar\\ngoiter, and a dosage of 7.4 MBq per gram adenomatous tissue was used in\\npatients with toxic adenoma. With a single radioiodine treatment good clinical\\nresults were obtained in patients with toxic adenoma (75% euthyroidism, 11%\\nhypothyroidism, 14% relapse) over a follow-up period varying between one and\\neight years. In patients with toxic multinodular goiter, 70% became euthyroid, 22% suffered a relapse of thyrotoxicosis and 8% became hypothyroid. Repeat\\nradioiodine therapy (3 for TA, 11 for TMNG) was successful in all patients with a\\nrelapse. Most other researchers have found somewhat fewer relapses and higher\\nhypothyroidism rates for toxic multinodular goiter; the recurrence rate for TMNG\\nvaried between 2% and 52%. The lowest failure rate was obtained with a fixed\\ndosage of 740 MBq (20 mCi). It seems contradictory that with that regimen also\\nthe hypothyroidism rate (6%) was slightly lower than what we found. At this\\nstage, a fixed dosage regimen seems preferable over the more laborious indi-vidualized\\nregimen. The underperformance of the individualized protocol could\\npossibly be explained by inaccurate volume measurements, especially in toxic\\nadenoma. Further optimization of the standardized regimen for these disorders\\nmay be expected from T3 suppression medication and from lithium co-medica-tion.\\nBoth may have the ability to increase the effect of a given amount of 131 I,\\nalthough the mechanisms of action are entirely different.\\nThe aim of radioiodine therapy in patients with nontoxic goiter is the reduction\\nof goiter size, while simultaneously preserving the normal thyroid function.\\nThis item is dealt with in Chapter 3. In 27 patients with sporadic nontoxic goiter,\\na therapeutic dose of 3.7 MBq per gram functioning thyroid tissue led to sub-stantial\\nobjective reduction of the goiter mass (by 34% on average). The subjec-tive\\nresults were more than adequate: 85% of all patients reported substantial\\nimprovement or complete relief of their complaints. Hypothyroidism resulted\\nin 3/27 (11%) of the patients. Thyroid volume measurements with 99m Tc-pertech-netate\\nscintigraphy were carried out for therapy dosage calculations as well as\\nfor follow-up measurements. For an objective assessment of the goiter reduc-tion,\\nCT-scanning was used as the gold standard. It was concluded that the accu-racy\\nof planar scintigraphic volume determinations in nontoxic goiter is suffi-cient\\nfor dosage calculation purposes if the thyroid volume does not exceed 200\\nml. However, as the therapy results were no less in patients with thyroid vol-umes\\nover 200 ml than in patients with smaller goiters, the accuracy of these\\nmeasurements does not seem to carry much weight. Recently, other researchers\\nhave reported equally satisfying results in the reduction of goiter size. It seems\\nthat the indication for radioiodine therapy in patients with nontoxic goiter may\\nbe broader than has thus far been assumed.\\nIn Chapter 4, a summary is given of the radioiodine therapy results using a\\nstandardized megabecquerel-per-gram dosage protocol in patients with Graves\\x92\\ndisease. The overall results are in compliance with the results of other research groups. We found a cure rate of 70% (including 39% hypothyroidism), and re-current\\nhyperthyroidism in 30%. The thyroid\\x92s radioiodine uptake capacity and\\nthe thyroid\\x92s mass appeared to be important factors with regard to the progno-sis\\nof the therapy outcome. Patients with thyroid weights > 60 g more often\\nsuffered a recurrence of hyperthyroidism, whereas those with thyroid weights\\n< 60 g appeared to be prone to a hypothyroid therapy outcome. Likewise, pa-tients\\nwith radioiodine uptake values < 60% had a higher risk of becoming hy-pothyroid\\nthan those with uptake values > 80%.\\nFrom the preceding four chapters we may conclude that the standard therapy\\ndosage formula D = W ´ (100%/U) ´ 3.7 MBq (where D is the therapy dosage in\\nMBq, W is the thyroid weight in grams, and U is the 24-h radioiodine uptake\\npercentage) is adequate for radioiodine therapy in all thyroid conditions under\\nconsideration, except in Graves\\x92 disease. It remained unclear what particular\\ndynamics of Graves\\x92 disease make the prediction of the therapy outcome so\\nmuch more difficult than in other thyroid disorders. We have looked into the\\ntechnical, biologic and logistic aspects of the two cornerstones of the radioiodine\\ndosage calculation, viz. the iodine uptake measurement and the scintigraphic\\nthyroid volume measurement. Chapter 5 sets off with a survey of the clinical\\npractice in The Netherlands, of radioiodine uptake measurements that are used\\nfor therapeutic 131 I dosage calculations in patients with Graves\\x92 hyperthyroidism.\\nFrom the response to a nation-wide questionnaire it was concluded that at most\\ndepartments the radioiodine uptake was measured (and the therapy dosage was\\ncomputed) several days or even weeks before the actual therapy date. Large dif-ferences\\nprevailed between institutions. This survey is followed by an analysis\\nof the clinical consequences of said practice. Variations in radioiodine uptake of\\nover 10% occurred \\x96 within a short time \\x96 in more than half the patient popula-tion\\n(62% of all patients with regard to the 5-hr 131 I uptake and 51% with regard\\nto the 24-hr uptake). The radioiodine turnover rate, too, was recognized as a\\nrelevant parameter for the dosage calculation. The incidence of increased radio-iodine\\nturnover as earlier reported in the literature (about 16%) was confirmed\\nin our study, but in 14% of all patients the turnover rate had changed from\\nnormal to increased or vice versa during an interval of 6 weeks on average.\\nThe results of radioiodine treatment in patients with Graves\\x92 hyperthyroidism\\nwere again reviewed; in comparison with the methods as used in Chapter 4 only\\none variable was altered, viz. the time-point of the 131 I uptake measurements. In\\nthe repeat study, described in Chapter 6, the uptake was measured on the day before therapy. The results differed significantly from those in the historic con-trols.\\nA significant shift occurred from hypothyroidism to persisting hyper-thyroidism.\\nThe outstanding significance of the radioiodine turnover rate as a\\npredictor of the clinical outcome was also recognized in this investigation. For\\npatients who had become euthyroid after radioiodine therapy, the radioiodine\\nturnover rates (i.e., 5/24-h 131 I uptake ratios) were 0.76-0.84 (95% confidence\\ninterval, C.I.), whereas in patients with persisting hyperthyroidism the turn-over\\nrates were 0.84-0.92 (95% C.I.). There was some overlap between patients\\nwith euthyroid and hypothyroid outcomes (rates 0.69-0.79, 95% C.I.), but the\\ndifferences were still highly significant. It seems that the radioiodine turnover\\nrate has great predictive potential with regard to the therapy outcome. On the\\nbasis of the present data, proper quantitative dosage corrections can not yet be\\nperformed, but indicatively 131 I therapy dosage adaptations may be realized.\\nThe second cornerstone of \\x91classic\\x92 131 I therapy dosage calculations, the thyroid\\nvolume, forms the center of interest in Chapters 7 and 8. Based on our earlier\\nexperience with CT-scanning in patients with nontoxic goiter, this modality\\nwas also chosen as the gold standard in a pilot study of 5 patients with Graves\\x92\\ndisease (Chapter 7). However, adequate manual segmentation was not feasible\\nwith native CT in 4 out of 5 patient studies. As CT with contrast enhancement is\\ncontra-indicated when radioiodine treatment is scheduled, it was concluded\\nthat CT is not suited for thyroid volume measurements under these conditions.\\nIt was argued that the discrepancies between the results in patients with non-toxic\\ngoiter and in patients with Graves\\x92 disease may be caused by the relatively\\nsmall thyroidal iodine pool in the latter. The lower iodine content would cause\\na lower signal intensity on CT, and less contrast between the thyroid gland and\\nthe surrounding tissues.\\nIn 25 patients with Graves\\x92 disease, a direct comparison was made between pla-nar\\nscintigraphy, ultrasound (US), and SPECT (with attenuation correction and\\nscatter correction, using standard commercial hardware and software), while\\nMRI was used as the gold standard. In this investigation (Chapter 8), it was con-cluded\\nthat MRI, SPECT, or US may be pursued for thyroid volume measurements.\\nPlanar scintigraphy is very inaccurate, and should be discarded as a means of\\npretherapeutic thyroid volume measurements. SPECT can be used as an alterna-tive\\nto planar scintigraphy for the qualitative functional diagnosis; MRI or US\\nshould only be used as an \\x91add-on\\x92 to scintigraphy. A general discussion of radioiodine therapy for benign thyroid disorders is pre-sented\\nin Chapter 9. In view of the good results in all nodular thyroid disorders\\nunder study, it was concluded that adjustments to the standard dosage formula\\nare not indicated. In patients with Graves\\x92 disease, it is much harder to make an\\naccurate prognosis of the therapy outcome. It is argued that attempts to pre-serve\\nnormal endogenous thyroid function through a \\x91patient-tailored\\x92 model\\nis to be preferred over the quick induction of hypothyroidism and subsequent\\nlevothyroxine substitution. Generalized proposals are made for adjustments to\\nthe standard radioiodine therapy dosage formula, making use of all optimiza-tion\\nfactors that were found in the investigations described in Chapters 2-7.\\nThis chapter is concluded by proposals for future research, primarily aimed\\nat optimization of radioiodine dosage calculations in patients with Graves\\x92 dis-ease.\\nDosimetric models and computer algorithms are needed to adjust for vari-ations\\nin thyroid volume, 131 I uptake and radioiodine turnover rate. SPECT meas-urements\\nof the 131 I concentration within the thyroid gland, instead of the thy-roid\\nvolume and the absolute amount of 131 I in the thyroid gland, deserve fur-ther\\ninvestigation. Because of the clinical implications, we also propose a study\\nof very-short-term variations in radioiodine uptake. The influence of antithy-roid\\ndrugs on the radioiodine turnover rate warrants further study, as well as a\\nquantification of the dose-effect relationship of lithium co-medication in pro-longing\\nthe retention of radioiodine in the thyroid. Other proposed medication\\nstudies include the investigation of the clinical value of triiodothyronine (T 3 )\\nsuppression therapy in autonomous thyroid disease, and of the clinical value of\\nlow-dose recombinant human thyrotropin (rhTSH) in patients with nontoxic\\ngoiter. Finally, it seems worthwhile from an endocrinologic viewpoint to do an\\nopen-label study of the merits of combined T 3 /T 4 medication versus T 4 alone in\\npatients who have become hypothyroid after radioiodine therapy.'],\n",

The\\n   thesis is divided in two main parts devoted to model linear vessel segments and the left ventricle of the heart,\\n   respectively. Chapters 2 to 4 present different aspects of a model-based technique for semi-automated\\n   quantification of linear vessel segments from 3-D Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA). Chapter 2 is\\n   concerned with a multiscale filter for the enhancement of vessels in 2-D and 3-D angiograms. Chapter 3 applies\\n   the filter developed in Chapter 2 to determine the central vessel axis in 3-D MRA images. This procedure is\\n   initialized using an efficient user interaction technique that naturally incorporates the knowledge of the operator\\n   about the vessel of interest. Also in this chapter, a linear vessel model is used to recover the position of the vessel\\n   wall in order to carry out an accurate quantitative analysis of vascular morphology. Prior knowledge is provided\\n   in two main forms: a cylindrical model introduces a shape prior while prior knowledge on the image acquisition\\n   (type of MRA technique) is used to define an appropriate vessel boundary criterion. In Chapter 4 an extensive in\\n   vitro and in vivo evaluation of the algorithm introduced in Chapter 3 is described. Chapters 5 to 7 change the\\n   focus to 3D cardiac image analysis from Magnetic Resonance Imaging. Chapter 5 presents an extensive survey,\\n   a categorization and a critical review of the field of cardiac modeling. Chapter 6 and Chapter 7 present\\n   successive refinements of a method for building statistical models of shape variability with particular emphasis on\\n   cardiac modeling. The method is based on an elastic registration method using hierarchical free-form\\n   deformations. A 3D shape model of the left and right ventricles of the heart was constructed. This model\\n   contains both the average shape of these organs as well as their shape variability. The methodology presented in\\n   the last two chapters could also be applied to other anatomical structures.

       "  'Description': ['Liver metastases frequently occur during the progression of various solid tumours, especially colorectal cancers, and are the cause of 25-50% of all cancer deaths [1-3]. In particular in patients with colorectal cancer the liver is the main metastatic site. Median survival of patients with liver metastases is approximately 6-12 months, and in the presence of extensive hepatic metastases survival is reported to be less than 6 months with no 5-year survivors [1,4,5]. Systemic chemotherapy results in only limited increase in life span with a median survival of around 1 year. In addition to systemic chemotherapy, local hepatic arterial chemotherapy, chemo-occlusion or combination therapies have resulted in some extension of life span of approximately 12-24 months [5-7]. Although loco-regional chemotherapy showed good palliative properties, a number of side effects such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea has been reported. In addition, hepatic toxicity associated with these therapies is often observed [5,8]. Surgery is still the only accepted treatment with curative intention, but only a minority of the patients can be subjected to this treatment [9,10]. Other newly developed surgical modalities like cryo-ablation and radiofrequency ablation have resulted in refinement of the surgical techniques which can be applied to a greater number of patients. Nevertheless, surgical therapies are only possible in approximately 10% of the patients [11,12].\\r\\n\\r\\nExternal beam radiotherapy in the treatment of hepatic malignancies is limited by the radiosensitivity of normal liver tissue, which can tolerate doses of only up to 30 Gy for whole liver irradiation [3,13,14]. Therefore, investigators have searched for ways to utilise the arterial vascularization of hepatic metastases in order to inject local radioactive deposits. Yttrium-90 ( 90 Y) labelled microspheres which can be administered intra-arterially, became available in the late 1980s and resulted in the start of a new safe therapy for treatment of liver cancer [2,15]. Livers of patients can receive up to 150 Gy without developing radiation hepatitis; a safety limit of 80 to 100 Gy is used in most studies [16,17]. The median survival in a study of 17 patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer treated with 90 Y microspheres was 14 months and there were 3 long-term survivors of 4 years [18]. As important as longevity, the treatment has very little morbidity [8].\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough studies with 90 Y labelled microspheres, either based on glass or resin, showed promising results, their high density (3.3 g/ml for glass and 1.6 g/ml for resin), apparent non-emission of 90 Y (Emax=2.28 MeV, t1/2=64.1h) for imaging can be considered as disadvantages. Therefore, Mumper et al. [19] proposed the use of poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) microspheres loaded with the ß -emitter holmium-166 ( 166 Ho) as alternative for the glass or resin based systems. 166 Ho-loaded microspheres have favourable characteristics above the 90 Y glass and resin based systems because of their relatively low density and biodegradability. Moreover, 166 Ho also emits ? -photons, which makes image-guided radionuclide therapy possible. However, because of the relatively low contents of holmium, 10% (w/w), Mumper et al. were not able to produce a patient dose with sufficient activity.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['This thesis started with testing the psychometric qualities of the Dutch version of the Urogenital Distress\\n   Inventory (UDI) and the Incontinence Impact Questionnaire (IIQ). Our analysis of the UDI showed that it\\n   consists of five domains that are clinically sound and reliable. Factor analysis of the IIQ showed that, in addition\\n   to the original four domains, a fifth factor with four items about embarrassment was extracted. Since women with\\n   urinary incontinence often report that they are embarrassed by their incontinence, the inclusion of such a domain\\n   in a disease-specific Quality of Life (QoL) questionnaire on urogenital symptoms is essential.\\n   With the UDI we found that one out of four women reported symptoms of overactive bladder and that these\\n   symptoms had the same negative consequences on QoL as urge incontinence. The prevalence of stress\\n   incontinence was as high as 40% but this symptom did not seem to bother women.\\n   Besides urinary symptoms we studied the prevalence of flatus and faecal incontinence in a community-based\\n   cross-sectional cohort study. We aimed at identifying whether childbirth is a risk factor for flatus and faecal\\n   incontinence as is commonly stated in literature. Our results, the first in its kind, show that there is no evidence\\n   for a general causal relationship between childbirth and faecal incontinence.\\n   Another common life event in women is a hysterectomy. We studied the consequences of hysterectomy on\\n   urinary continence. We compared the prevalence and severity of stress- and urge urinary incontinence in women\\n   scheduled for hysterectomy with women from a random community sample who were not scheduled for\\n   hysterectomy . We did not demonstrate a difference in prevalence between these two groups. However, if\\n   urinary incontinence is present, women scheduled for hysterectomy are significantly more bothered by it as\\n   compared to women from the community sample. We also studied the long-term consequences of hysterectomy\\n   on urge and stress urinary incontinence and found that hysterectomy increases the risk for urge incontinence but\\n   not for stress incontinence. Especially since urge incontinence negatively affects QoL, we recommend that\\n   women should be informed about this long-term consequence of hysterectomy.\\n   Finally we studied the effect of different coping strategies on QoL in women with symptoms of pelvic floor\\n   dysfunction. We showed that, at the same level of symptom severity, women who more frequently used\\n   emotion-oriented and passive coping strategies reported a significantly worse QoL as compared to women who\\n   applied more problemoriented, active coping strategies. These coping strategies were also of importance in\\n   relation to help-seeking behaviour in women with symptoms of pelvic floor dysfunction. First, we analysed\\n   differences between clinical cases and community cases with mild symptoms of pelvic floor dysfunction and\\n   found that clinical cases expressed more passive coping strategies as compared to community cases. Secondly,\\n   we analysed differences between clinical cases and community cases with severe symptoms of pelvic floor\\n   dysfunction and found that clinical cases expressed more problem-oriented, active coping strategies as\\n   compared to community cases.\\n   In addition, we found that lower educated women significantly more often presented themselves with mild\\n   symptoms at our clinic as compared to higher educated women. This implicates that these women have an\\n   increased risk of undergoing diagnostic and therapeutic procedures at low symptom severity levels.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Image guided, minimally invasive adenomectomy for solitary gland disease in primary hyperparathyroidism'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Introduction:\\nSince the introduction in the 1970s of the unilateral approach in surgery for primary hyperparathyroidism by Wang, authors have increasingly been recommending limited forms of parathyroid surgery. Although unilateral explorations reduce operation time and admission days, decrease operative risk and give better cosmetic results, the debate about the best surgical treatment for primary hyperparathyroidism has never been settled. \\x91Bilateralists\\x92 oppose less invasive approaches because they estimate the incidence of multiple gland disease to be as high as 30%. However, in spite of a systematic bilateral exploration of the neck in search of the diseased parathyroid gland, with identification and estimation of the size of all parathyroid tissue, in only 44% of cases are four glands identified, in 37% three, and in 19% less than three.\\nIn chapter 1 we reported an exceptional case of persistent hyperparathyroidism (due to a non-descended inferior parathyroid) after extensive bilateral exploration, illustrating a clinical dilemma that can be encountered in parathyroid surgery. Imaging carried out prior to re-exploration and including, among other methods, ultrasonography and computed tomography, revealed a parathyroid adenoma at the level of the mandibular angle and the hyoid bone. Guided by the imaging results the adenoma was successfully resected by a local direct procedure taking less than 10 minutes.\\nIn general, the main reason an adenoma is not found during exploration is the variability in location, rather than variety in the number of glands. It is therefore of pivotal importance to understand not only the anatomy, but also the embryology of the parathyroid glands. As radiologist John Doppman succinctly stated, \\x91If you are an experienced parathyroid surgeon and not able to find a tumor, you cannot have looked high enough.\\nSince primary hyperparathyroidism can be diagnosed with nearly 100% accuracy and successfully treated in more than 95% of cases, surgery is the treatment of choice. The gold standard in parathyroid surgery has been conventional neck exploration (CNE), and with success rates exceeding 95% and virtually no complications nothing more seemed left to be desired. However, it cannot be denied that there is a discrepancy between the extent of the operation and the size of the offending gland in the majority of patients. Encouraged by the pace of development in methods of imaging (resulting in increased accuracy), combined with the knowledge that primary hyperparathyroidism is caused by a solitary adenoma in at least 85% of cases, and our experience of the relatively simple and quick MIA procedure (chapter 1) we wondered whether such a direct, minimally invasive strategy could be utilized for the more common cases of primary hyperparathyroidism as well.\\nFor this purpose we formulated the following hypothesis (chapter 3): \\x91A substantial group of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism can be successfully treated by limited access surgery after preoperative localization studies and may thus be spared unnecessary extensive dissection (conventional neck exploration).\\n\\nMinimally invasive adenomectomy:\\nWe prospectively tested this minimally invasive approach as an alternative to CNE. In chapter 4 we described the results of 110 consecutive patients who underwent parathyroidectomy, 84 of whom were selected for minimally invasive adenomectomy (MIA) and 26 for CNE. Operating time was 20 minutes in the MIA group and 80 minutes in the CNE group (p<0.05), and admission days were reduced to 1.7 days (MIA group) from 3.0 (CNE group) (p<0.05). MIA was shown to be a safe and effective technique with a success rate of 96%, capable of replacing conventional neck exploration in approximately 75% of patients, with virtually no complications. Several other investigators have proposed less invasive strategies as alternatives for CNE, most of which have focused on unilateral neck exploration. True minimally invasive techniques were reported to be feasible, guided by preoperative ultrasonography, in about 40% of cases, while others have reported excellent results using intraoperative sestamibi-technetium99m scintigraphy (Sestamibi) parathyroid scanning with a hand-held gamma probe. Though attractive when the neck has to be reoperated on due to failure of an initial exploration, in our opinion the costs associated with the Sestamibi scanning preclude its routine use, as discussed below. Alternatively, some surgeons have advocated endoscopy to achieve minimally invasive adenomectomy in selected patients. Although conceptually elegant, this technique appears difficult to learn and certainly requires more operating time than the direct approach described in this thesis.\\n\\nAsymptomatic and mildly symptomatic patients:\\nThe 1990 National Institute of Health (NIH) Consensus Development Conference arrived at a consensus on the indications for surgical intervention in asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism 10. Among their findings, the panel concluded that the diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism does not mandate referral for operative intervention in all cases. Conscientious surveillance was thought to be justified in asymptomatic patients whose calcium levels are only mildly elevated (to < 3.0 mmol/L; normal 2.20-2.60), and whose renal and bone status are close to normal (creatinine clearance reduced not more than 30% and bone mass not more than two standard deviations below those of controls matched for age, sex, and ethnic origin.\\nNevertheless, patients with primary hyperparathyroidism have significant functional health status impairment independent of the level of serum calcium 11. In addition, our experience with MIA has provided us with new arguments for making it the surgical option of choice in asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic patients. In chapter 5 we advised the following strategy for the asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patient. When a patient has biochemically proven hypercalcemia with inappropriate levels of parathormone (PTH), localization of the adenoma has to be attempted by Doppler-ultrasonography and computed tomography. When test results unequivocally indicate a solitary adenoma the patient is advised to undergo a minimally invasive procedure. However, if the test results are equivocal or indicate the possibility of multiglandular involvement a conservative policy is advocated. If the disease advances, major symptoms develop and/or the patient fulfills the NIH-guidelines, parathyroid imaging should be repeated before whichever form of operation is indicated.\\n\\nImaging:\\nBefore the introduction of imaging-guided, minimally invasive parathyroid surgery, the general opinion about preoperative localizing studies was that imaging before initial surgery was not worthwhile. This objection to the routine use of localizing tests was based on 1) inferior sensitivity rates in localizing studies (reaching 85% maximum) when compared with success rates in conventional neck exploration (over 95%); 2) the reduced accuracy of localizing studies in multiglandular disease; 3) an unjustified economic burden because of lack of evidence for the cost effectiveness of imaging studies; and 4) the possibillity of misleading less experienced surgeons. Now, a decade after the NIH meeting, some of these arguments may be viewed critically.\\nFirstly, most of these studies were carried out retrospectively and none followed a strict protocol. Modern, state-of-the-art imaging modalities and prospective adherence to a strict protocol gives, in our experience, good results. Furthermore, a team approach with a dedicated radiologist and an experienced endocrine surgeon has contributed considerably to the success of direct adenomectomy. In our series ultrasonography gave a sensitivity of 78%, a specificity of 78% and a positive predictive value of 96% (chapter 6). Despite the fact that the combined results of ultrasonography and computed tomography moderately improved the sensitivity to 84% (chapter 4), the diagnostic use of spiral computed tomography was advised with caution, because of the associated costs and risks of radiation (chapter 6). Nevertheless, the routine employment of both techniques can be justified because 1) computed tomography produces an operator-independent roadmap, and 2) with the use of \\x91cine-loop\\x92 reconstruction at the computer work-station, additional information and an essential three-dimensional view are available, helping the surgeon in planning the operation.\\nSecondly, imaging (in our series ultrasonography combined with computed tomography) was shown to be beneficial in preoperative planning for the treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism since, with its aid, we were able to select approximately 75% of patients for minimally invasive adenomectomy. Thirdly, economic evaluations were limited in number and, if available, mostly based on bilateral explorations.\\nOn the basis of our personal favorable results we adhered strictly to the use of ultrasonography combined with computed tomography. However, this does not preclude the use of other modalities in the treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism. Parathyroid scanning using radioisotopes has evolved over the years and is able to localize adenomas in approximately 90% of cases. The use of a hand-held gamma probe (Sestamibi) to guide the surgeon to the parathyroid adenoma has been advocated as being useful in reoperations on the neck. Moreover, excellent cure rates have also been reported with the use of a gamma probe in initial surgery, imultaneously decreasing operating time and hospital stay, resulting in significant cost reduction without compromising patient safety. Conventional scintigraphy (thallium201-technetium-Tc99m pertechnetate scanning) is, in our opinion, not suitable for selecting patients for MIA because of the relatively poor image resolution and anatomical information obtained. Sestamibi, has been reported to give sensitivity rates up to 100% in solitary disease 14, but, in our opinion, it should be restricted to a selected group of patients because of its high costs (+/- Euro 680). The modest increase in accuracy using Sestamibi does not justify the disproportionate rise in cost. Other imaging modalities consist of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and selective venous catheterization for measurement of PTH levels. Although MRI (sensitiv-ity 57-90%) is only marginally more accurate than computed tomography (sensitivity 41-86%) 13 19, MRI avoids the need for use of contrast medium and shoulder artifacts are circumvented, we prefer computed tomography for reasons of availability and cost. Finally, since selective PTH sampling requires an expert radiologist, is invasive and associated with high costs, its use should be restricted to reoperations.\\n\\nParathormone assay:\\nThe clinical utility of rapid PTH measurement in parathyroid surgery was first reported in 1988, using a modified intact PTH immunoradiometric assay. The authors concluded that intraoperative measurement of PTH would be helpful to the surgeon. The combination of more accurate preoperative localization studies and the ability to predict the postoperative serum calcium would facilitate limited explorations. The use of non-radioactive kits transportable on a trolley has allowed the rapid assay to be performed in or adjacent to the operating theatre. These commercially available portable kits measure PTH within 15 minutes with sensitivity rates reaching 96%, specificity of 100% and overall accuracy of 97%. Although it cannot be denied that these tests are highly effective providing true intraoperative results, the preliminary procedures (e.g. instrument performance check, generating calibration curves and assay quality control prior to surgery), and their substantial cost preclude their widespread introduction. In a search for a less costly alternative rapid PTH assay, we studied the reliability and applicability of a non-portable rapid PTH assay to predict successful surgical treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism (chapter 7). In that chapter we described the results of the first 35 patients measured with a rapid PTH assay (modified Immulite Regular assay) providing results within 70 minutes. Once the results were shown to agree fully with both conventional PTH measurements and postoperative serum calcium levels, we included the Immulite Regular assay in our protocol. We also tested three other non-portable PTH assays (Immulite Turbo, Advantage Regular and Advantage Turbo assays), which are described in chapter 8. All these methods were concluded to be useful to ascertain the success of an exploration. The Immulite Regular and Immulite Turbo assays, however, were believed to be more accurate than the Advantage Regular and Advantage Turbo assays when used according to our protocol (a decline in PTH of >50%, measured 8 minutes after resection, predicting normocalcemia).\\n\\nCosts:\\nMinimally invasive adenomectomy has definitely entered the therapeutic regimens for primary hyperparathyroidism, and therefore it is important to study the economic burden. We cost-analyzed a prospective series of 164 patients to obtain information on the relative costs of MIA and CNE (chapter 9). To observe the effect of changing appreciable variables, multiple sensitivity analyses were carried out. The mean cost of MIA was calculated as . 1,288 and that of CNE . 2,106 (p<0.0005). The reason MIA is so much cheaper than CNE is the differences in operating time (median 20 minutes in MIA versus 75 minutes in CNE) and admission days (2 days in MIA versus 3 days in CNE). Sensitivity analyses showed that an increase in total average costs of 63%, an increase in operating time to 272 minutes, prolongation of admission from 2 to 4.5 days, or an initial operation failure rate of 54% in the MIA group would result in MIA costs equaling those for CNE. Such extreme examples are clearly unrealistic, but admission time remains a variable that is highly dependent on \\x91local\\x92 logistics, and may be amenable to reduction. In particular, day care surgery will shortly become possible for MIA, provided a safe protocol for the management of postoperative hypocalcemia can be designed (and adhered to).\\n\\nThe future:\\nThe ongoing technical developments of imaging modalities presage an increase in discriminating capacity and increasing accuracy of various techniques, making MIA possible for even more patients. The possibility of day-care MIA, using intravenous sedation combined with local anesthesia, will further liberalize the indications for this method.\\n\\nConclusion:\\nIn conclusion, minimally invasive adenomectomy is a safe and effective alternative to conventional neck exploration, able to replace it in approximately 75% of cases. It is not only associated with a very low complication rate, comparable to that of conventional neck exploration, but is also cheaper than conventional exploration. In the future, additional savings may be anticipated when day-care MIA becomes possible.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is the most frequent cause of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) during infancy. During the winter season RSV bronchiolitis is one the most common causes of hospitalization as well as mechanical ventilation (MV). Following RSV bronchiolitis 30-70% infants develop recurrent episodes of wheezing. The aim of this thesis was to study clinical and immunological predictors of short-term and long-term airway morbidity. New predictors will be useful in the clinical setting as well as understanding mechanisms underlying RSV bronchiolitis and the development of subsequent airway morbidity.\\r\\nPost-conceptional age in mechanically ventilated infants - New strategies have become available to prevent severe RSV infection in prematurely born infants, including palivizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody. It is not known for how long prevention of RSV infection in preterm infants should be considered. It was shown that preterm infants, without chronic lung disease have increased risk for severe RSV infection until post-conceptional age reaches 44 weeks. \\r\\nCell-mediated immunity to RSV - We compared the immune response in the blood and nasopharyngeal aspirates between RSV-infected infants with and without the requirement of MV. In vivo IFN-? levels in the nasopharynx were lower in RSV-infected infants requiring MV. In addition, we have shown that monocyte interleukin (IL)-12 production was inversely related to duration of MV. Taken together, these data suggest that severe RSV LRTI is associated with decreased level of CMI and that initiation of CMI is required for the convalescence of MV during RSV LRTI.\\r\\nPrediction of long-term airway morbidity - Studies in the past have shown that clinical parameters, such as sex, age at onset of RSV LRTI and disease severity during RSV LRTI are not related to long term airway morbidity. We demonstrate that airflow limitation during RSV LRTI is the first useful clinical predictor for subsequent recurrent wheezing.\\r\\nMonocyte IL-10 production and long-term airway morbidity \\x96 We have shown that monocyte IL-10 production in the blood during the convalescent phase of RSV LRTI predicts subsequent recurrent wheezing. This is one of the major findings presented in this thesis. \\r\\nConclusion This thesis has provided new determinants of short-term and long-term airway morbidity associated with RSV LRTI. Findings lead to the conclusion that antigen-presenting cells (APC) could play an orchestrating role in the immune response during RSV bronchiolitis. Therefore, we conclude that future research should focus on the role of APC, including dendritic cells, in the pathogenesis in RSV LRTI.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The research described in the thesis had two major aims: to find methods for objective measurement of motion in the orbit, and to determine the clinical use of these methods in patients with orbital disorders. This implied that a number of research questions had to be answered in the fields of both image science and of ophthalmology and orbitology.\\r\\nThe results have established that measurement of the two- and three-dimensional motion of tissues in the orbit is feasible in humans. It can be imaged in 2-D and 3-D with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) sequences. It can be calculated objectively from these sequences using optical flow methods. First order techniques were found to be superior for this purpose as they are less sensitive to noise, partial volume effects and aliasing. A new first-order 3-D optical flow algorithm was developed for robust and computationally efficient three-dimensional optical flow estimation. A number of techniques were developed to visualize 2- and 3-D motion combined with the anatomy in 3-D space, using color-coding. \\r\\nThe results of two clinical studies have established the clinical use of objective measurement of motion in the orbit in a number of orbital and motion disorders. The studies have resulted in an explanation for the persistent pain that may occur after enucleation of the globe, based on motion measurements in patients after enucleation. They have also shown that orbital tumors can be differentiated using motion studies.\\r\\nThe results have also shown that the position of the rectus muscle pulleys is the same in patients with Graves  disease and in normals. After surgical decompression of the orbit, the muscles and their pulleys are usually not displaced, except in cases where specific muscle paths and pulleys are displaced in specific patterns, resulting in specific motility disturbances. Thus, a new explanation has been found for the motility disturbances that may occur in some patients after decompression surgery for Graves  orbitopathy.\\r\\nThese last findings have led to the notion central to this thesis, namely that the orbital tissues are an organ in their own right, the organ of gaze, and do not need their bony orbit to function normally.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Alzheimer\\x92s disease (AD) is the most common cause of progressive dementia and a neurodegenerative disorder, which despite scientific progress in recent years is still a disease of unknown etiology. One pathological hallmark of AD is the presence of neuritic plaques in the cortical gray matter. These extracellular depositions are mainly composed of aggregated amyloid-beta (A?) peptides and are surrounded by dystrophic neurites and glial cells. The A? peptide is derived through changes in the processing of the amyloid-beta precursor protein and according to the \\x91amyloid cascade hypothesis\\x92 these changes are central to the disease process. A? is a 4 kDa peptide of 39-43 amino acids and studies with synthetic A? show that it can act as a potent and direct neurotoxic agent. There is however an increasing amount of evidence that A? can be indirect neurotoxic by activating surrounding glial cells. Neuritic plaques, but not diffuse plaques, are reported to be surrounded by microglia. Since microglia are able to produce cytokines as well as chemotactic and neurotoxic factors a lot of research has focused on the ability of A? to induce these events in microglia. The scope of this thesis is to question the role of these surrounding glial cells, microglia and astrocytes, in the inflammatory process and the continuation of this process.\\nThe results presented in chapter 2 show the effect of A?(25-35) on the binding of A?(1-42) to macrophages and the consequent superoxide anion production. A?(25-35) markedly enhanced the effect of A?(1-42). Chapter 3 shows that both ERK 1/2 and p38 MAPK signal transduction pathways as well as PKC are involved in the amyloid-?-stimulated superoxide anion production in macrophages. In contrast, only ERK 1/2 MAPK seems to be involved in TNF-? production, questioning the connection between PKC and ERK 1/2 activation. Chapter 4 shows that A? is able to induce TNF-? and superoxide anion production in macrophages and that astrocytes do not produce these inflammatory mediators. In cocultures however a decreased production of these putative neurotoxins was seen, probably due to the binding of A? to the astrocytes. A? is able to induce NF-?B activation in astrocytes. However, due to the already high NF-?B activity in macrophages, an additional effect of A? could not be detected. Chapter 5 shows the ability of A?(1-42) to stimulate the production, and expression of MIP-1? and MIP-1? in macrophages and MCP-1 in astrocytes and in cocultures their of. In chapter 6 the effectiveness of these CC-chemokines to attract monocytes was investigated. Using neutralizing antibodies it was shown that A?-stimulated macrophages produce MIP-1?, MIP-1? and MCP-1 in such amounts that they attract monocytes.'],\n",

From this distribution, functional information can be obtained (e.g. perfusion and metabolic processes). To assess the viability of myocardial tissue using SPECT, one perfusion measurement is acquired with the patient in rest and one measurement after exercise. In dual-isotope SPECT, Tl-201 can be used for the rest acquisition and Tc-99m for the stress acquisition. Both acquisitions take about 20 minutes each.\\nIn simultaneous dual-isotope SPECT, the rest and stress image are measured in one single acquisition of 20 minutes. This has the advantage of strongly reduced study time which reduces patient discomfort and increases patient throughput and very important, enables perfect registration between rest and stress image. However, simultaneous dual-isotope SPECT is hampered by photon down-scatter; the Tc-99m photons used for the stress image can be detected into the rest Tl-201 image, degrading the quality of the rest image. Accurate correction for photon down-scatter is therefore mandatory.  Correction can be achieved by calculating the spatial distribution of down-scattered photons.\\nMonte Carlo simulation is often regarded as a very accurate method to calculate photon scatter,  however it is computational very demanding (slow) and therefore unsuited for clinical use.  In this thesis methods are proposed to accelerate Monte Carlo simulation of down-scatter by combining Monte Carlo calculations with analytical simulation methods, resulting in acceleration factors of more than one-thousand. Application of the accelerated Monte Carlo method on clinical acquired SPECT data proved excellent down-scatter correction in acceptable computation times. \\nIn conclusion, the achieved acceleration of Monte Carlo now makes accurate correction for down-scatter possible, which realizes the use of the simultaneous dual-isotope SPECT protocol with the many advantages this protocol has to offer.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Symphathetic nerve activity in patients with renal desease : physiological and pharmacological modulation'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Hypertension is common in chronic renal failure (CRF). It is an important cardiovascular risk factor and therefor it is important to establish factors contributing to the pathophysiology of this hypertension. Apart from volume overload and activation of the renin-angiotensin system numerous (minor) mechanisms have been found to contribute to the pathophysiology. There is now increasing evidence, that sympathetic overactivity may be crucial in the pathogenesis. In the present thesis we studied sympathetic nerve activity and the pharmacological and physiological modulation of this activity in various forms of hypertensive renal disease. Furthermore we analyzed the effects on sympathetic activity of cyclosporine and tacrolimus, to elucidate the role of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) in transplantation-associated hypertension.\\nIn this theses we use muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) to assess sympathetic activity. MSNA is a reproducible direct online registration of post-synaptic nerve activity to resistance vessels and there is a direct correlation with MSNA and systemic vascular resistance. \\nMSNA is measured in hypertensive renal disease patients. It has been established that plasma renin activity (PRA) is inappropriately increased in relation to the fluid status in these patients. High levels of PRA reflect high angiotensin II (AngII) levels. AngII can increase sympathetic activity. PRA and MSNA are related to the volume status in a large group of patients. We established that as with PRA MSNA is inappropriately increased with respect to volume status in CRF patients. \\nReducing the effects of AngII through ACE-inhibition could reduce sympathetic hyperactivity. We compared the effects of an ACE-inhibitor with those of a calcium-channel blocker, amlodipine, which is a drug not affecting the renin system. ACE-inhibition reduced while amlodipine increased the already augmented sympathetic activity. Furthermore the blood pressure lowering effect of a central sympatholytic drug, clonidine, was augmented in CRF compared to healthy controls, underscoring the importance of the effects of sympathetic hyperactivity on hypertension in CRF.\\nAngII receptor blockers may provide a more complete blockade of the renin cascade than ACE-inhibition. This may also result in more pronounced inhibition of the sympathetic activity. We addressed this hypothesis by comparing these two types of drugs with respect to their effect on blood pressure and sympathetic activity. We could not find a clinical relevant difference between the effects of these two agents. \\nCould sympathetic nerve activity already be increased when renal function is still normal? Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) patients are often identified as \\x93renal patient\\x94 when kidney function is still normal. PKD patients with normal renal function and normal renal function are not different from controls whereas PKD patients with normal renal function but with hypertension already show an increased blood pressure. Thus already in an early stage of a renal disease sympathetic nerve activity is increased.\\nThe last two studies in this thesis address the cause of cyclosporine-associated hypertension and renal dysfunction. The pathogenesis of this type of hypertension is probably multifactorial. It is likely that increased sympathetic nerve activity is one of these factors. There are however contrasting findings both in animals and in humans, which may be explained by differences in dosage and duration of treatment. Tacrolimus (TAC) is a newer immunosuppressive agent, which is believed to cause less hypertension. We addressed the question whether cyclosporine (CsA) after single and sustained administration has any effect on MSNA and whether TAC acts differently in this respect in healthy humans. Acute administration of CsA resulted in a dose dependent increase in MSNA while sustained administration reduced MSNA. In contrast acute TAC had no effects on MSNA while it had comparable effects during sustained use.\\nRenal vasoconstriction and subsequent salt retention could be a factor contributing to the pathogenesis of cyclosporine-associated hypertension. Some but not all studies have indicated that TAC may cause less renal vasoconstriction. To clarify this matter, we studied in healthy subjects the effects of both agents on renal hemodynamics. We found a difference between CsA and TAC: CsA caused renal vasoconstriction while TAC did not. Maybe these findings could be beneficial during long-term use in transplant patients\\nIn conclusion this theses elucidates the role of sympathetic hyperactivity in the pathogenesis of hypertension in CRF and the effects of important antihypertensive agents with respect to this patient category. While it also establishes the crude effects of CsA and TAC on sympathetic activity in healthy controls.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['In Chapter 1 the theoretical concept of childhood disablement is explained. In addition, a brief introduction is presented, regarding pediatric functional status measurement, and more specifically the subject of this thesis: the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory. The aims and outline of the thesis are formulated.\\r\\nIn Chapter 2 the applicability of the PEDI in the Netherlands is studied involving a sample of 20 Dutch children without disabilities. Their functional status outcome is compared to American peers; the Rasch statistical model was used to analyze the Dutch data. Score profiles were found not to be compatible with the score profiles of American children. More specifically, the data suggested inter-cultural differences. Based on this study, it is argued that cross-cultural validation of the PEDI was necessary before using it in the Netherlands.\\r\\nThe translation and adaptation procedure in developing a Dutch version of the PEDI was based on current scientific guidelines in cross-cultural research as outlined in Chapter 3. A content validity study of the Dutch PEDI was subsequently performed and is also presented in this chapter. In this study, 31 allied health professionals completed a validity questionnaire. They confirmed the functional content and feasibility of the Dutch PEDI for pediatric functional status measurement. Both the adaptation process and content validity study generated the addition of eight new questions into the Dutch PEDI. Four of them are linked to an essential daily childhood activity in the Netherlands: \\x91bicycling\\x92.\\r\\nIn Chapter 4 the reliability of the Dutch PEDI is examined. Therefore, parents of 64 children without disabilities and parents of 31 children with disabilities were interviewed. Inter-interviewer reliability was studied afterscoring audio-taped interviews by a second researcher. For intra-respondent reliability the same parent was interviewed twice within two weeks; for inter-respondent reliability both parents of a child were interviewed independently within a few days. The proportion of matching scores varied from 118 good to excellent in inter-interviewer reliability and inter-respondent reliability, and from moderate to excellent in intra-respondent reliability. Intraclass correlation coefficients were all excellent. Cronbach\\x92s alpha (internal consistency) was calculated on a sample of 63 healthy children aged two years, and varied from excellent in the self-care and social function domain, to moderate in the mobility domain. Although some adaptations have to be made, good psychometric properties of the Dutch PEDI have been established.\\r\\nIn Chapter 5 the discriminative validity of the Dutch PEDI is examined in 62 children without disabilities and in 197 children with disabilities (Infantile Encephalopathy, N= 40; Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis, N= 20; Neurometabolic conditions, N=36; Neuromuscular Disorders, N= 9; Skeletal Disorders, N= 28; Spina Bifida, N= 41; Traumatic Injury, N= 23). Discriminant analysis revealed an excellent degree of sensitivity and specificity of the Dutch PEDI in identifying childhood disablement (non-disabled vs. disabled). The results also suggest the identification of subsets within the clinical samples: functional status linked to CNS involvement and musculo-skeletal involvement indicating potentials of the Dutch PEDI to discriminate within specific clinical groups. \\r\\nIn Chapter 6 the responsiveness of the Dutch PEDI was examined. In contrast to traditional approaches, the responsiveness was measured at individual level. Children with Traumatic Injury (TI), Neuromuscular Diseases (NMD), and Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) (N=85) were measured three times. A Global Rating Scale (GRS) was used as an external standard of change; analyses were done at an individual level. Internal and external responsiveness were tested using \\x91order restricted statistical inference\\x92. The internal responsiveness of the PEDI varied from moderate to excellent. The external responsiveness varied from moderate to good. The study results support the author\\x92s opinion that the Dutch PEDI is able to measure meaningful individual changes in functional status over time'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['European legislation brings about a new responsibility for occupational medicine. However, with the commercial approach and the focus on sickness absence management the attention for detection and prevention of work-related health effects has been shifted away. \\nIn the last decade, the association between industrial dust exposure and COPD, and exposure to respiratory allergens and (respiratory) allergic diseases has been clearly demonstrated. Many different high-molecular weight (HMW) aeroallergens from different occupations (bakers, laboratory animal workers, and hospital workers) have been identified as inducing occupational asthma. \\nFor exposure to aeroallergens no save health-based exposure standards have been identified. This leaves workers inadequately protected from developing respiratory disease. Early detection of workers developing COPD as well as allergic diseases is therefore needed. However, validated methods for early diagnosis of workers at risk are sparsely developed. \\nWith the use of statistical methods a diagnostic process can be imitated. Prediction rules reflect the sequential diagnostic process and evaluate which of the findings contribute to the estimation of the diagnostic probability. The rules either estimate the probability of a diagnostic outcome or link personal characteristics and objective factors for prognostic purposes. \\nThis thesis is directed towards the question how all putative diagnostic data collected in occupational health practice can be used to formulate which combination of findings may contribute to the prediction of the likelihood of presence of an occupational (allergic) respiratory disease. Probability estimation can be assessed using questionnaires, data from medical tests, and results from exposure measurements. Using diagnostic and prognostic rules, the probability of the presence or occurrence of an occupational (respiratory or allergic) disease can be predicted in an individual worker and can be used to identify worker groups at different risk levels. \\nA diagnostic study demonstrated that, early detection of workers with COPD can be based on predictors derived from a standard questionnaire.  Stratification into risk groups showed a valid and cost reducing method to be used in occupational health practice.\\nFor the detection of workers sensitized to high-molecular weight allergens stratifying workers into a group with a high and a group with a low sensitization rate, is the most appropriate first step. Medical examination and occupational hygiene interventions can be based on this stratification. In workers with a high sensitization rate, medical examination can concentrate on occupational allergic diseases responsible for absenteeism and doctors visit. The individual medical investigation can focus on allergic rhinitis, conjunctivitis, contact urticaria, asthma, and lung functiom. In workers with a low sensitization rate at baseline, the probability of future sensitization can be estimated by a two-step prognostic rule based on questionnaire items and IgE serology (indicating atopy). By applying the rule, workers at high, medium and low risk of becoming sensitized can be detected and preselected for health surveillance objectives. \\nImplementation of these rules in workers exposed to other HMW allergens (latex, flour) needs specific validation. However, these rules may initially be applied in conditions of exposure to HMW allergens of unknown origin (biotechnology).  \\nThe described algorithms  may contribute to convincing decisions by occupational physicians.'],\n",

Of all patients presenting with dyspepsia, only a minority has organic disease. Roughly 25% of the dyspeptic patients presenting in primary care is referred for endoscopy. At endoscopy, relevant organic disease is found in 30-45% of the patients (5-15% peptic ulcer disease and 25-30% gastro-oesophageal disease). Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) infection is accepted as the most common cause of gastritis, and is aetiologically involved in gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer and primary gastric B-cell lymphoma. For this reason, the role of H pylori diagnosis and treatment in the management of peptic ulcer disease (PUD) has been a topic of interest in research. Ideally, patients suspected of PUD should be tested for H pylori infection without undergoing endoscopy. H pylori eradication is effective PUD treatment and prevents relapses. Therefore, the diagnostic value of non-invasive H pylori tests (i.e. tests not requiring an endoscopy) in PUD diagnosis should be evaluated. In addition, the additional diagnostic value of H pylori tests in patients at risk for PUD have to be determined. Finally, a guideline based on the established diagnostic value of H pylori testing in dyspeptic patients in primary care needs to be developed and introduced effectively in medical practice.\\n\\nThe research questions answered in this thesis are:\\n* To what extent is H pylori diagnosis and treatment currently incorporated in dyspepsia management in primary care in the Netherlands?\\n* What is the value of H pylori testing in addition to history taking in diagnosing peptic ulcer disease in primary care?\\n* What is the optimal non-invasive H pylori test for diagnosis in primary care?\\n*  What is the diagnostic performance of a new immunoassay for the detection of H pylori infection in primary care?\\n*  Is compliance with a new dyspepsia guideline increased after introduction by an educational or financial stimulus for GPs?'],\n",

This thesis aims at describing the risk of complications and benefits of vaccination.   \\r\\nIn chapter 2 we determine prognostic factors for influenza-associated hospitalization or death during the 1996/97 influenza A epidemic in a case-control study among adult patients with high-risk medical conditions. The presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure, previous hospitalization, high GP visiting rate and poly-pharmacy were prognostic factors for influenza, bronchitis, pneumonia, diabetes, heart failure or myocardial infarction, particularly in patients of working-age.\\r\\nIn chapter 3 we describe the development and validation of a clinical prediction rule for the need for hospitalization for influenza or pneumonia, or death using databases covering over 120,000 non-institutionalized US senior citizens. The accuracy of the rule in the derivation cohort was high when a cut-off sum-score ?50 points is chosen (sensitivity:89%, specificity:51%) while only 50% of seniors would have to be selected for vaccination. \\r\\nIn chapter 4 we describe several design and analytical methods aimed at limiting or preventing  confounding by indication  in non-experimental safety and effectiveness studies. \\r\\nIn chapter 5 we describe a two-season retrospective cohort study covering the 1995/96 and 1996/97 influenza outbreaks among 349 asthmatics aged 0?12 years. A statistically higher pooled vaccine protectiveness of 55% (95% CI 20?75%) was observed among preschool children with asthma compared with those aged 6?12 years: -5% (-81?39%). \\r\\nIn chapter 6 we assessed the cost-effectiveness of influenza vaccination among 1,696 adult patients with chronic lung disease followed up during the 1995/96 influenza A epidemic. The incidence of low respiratory tract infection, acute cardiac disease or all-cause death was 15%. No benefits were observed among patients of working-age. Among elderly vaccinees, the occurrence of any complication was reduced by 50% (95% CI 17?70%). The economical benefit was estimated at £50 per elderly vaccinee. \\r\\nIn chapter 7 we present a prospective nested case-control study in 41 (1998/99 influenza B epidemic) and 52 (1999/2000 influenza A epidemic) primary care centers We studied 4241 patients with asthma or COPD of working-age in season one and 5966 in season two. After adjustments, vaccination was not associated with reductions in exacerbations of lung disease, pneumonia, heart failure, or myocardial infarction (pooled odds ratio: 1.07; 95% CI 0.63-?1.80). \\r\\nIn chapter 8 we assess the risk for hospitalization or death and the effectiveness of influenza vaccination among subgroups of over 120,000 elderly persons. 55?118 high-risk persons and 264?290 healthy persons needed to be vaccinated to prevent one hospitalization or death. \\r\\nIn the last part we assessed the effectiveness of a nationwide multi-faceted prevention program involving general practitioners (GP) on influenza immunization practice using a before-and-after study design. During the period 1995?1997, a variety of behavioral methods was implemented to enhance physician adoption of the immunization guideline. In 988 practices all influenza vaccination characteristics markedly improv-e-d from 1995 to 1997.

       "  'Description': ['Much knowledge concerning the mechanisms and nature of the postinfarction arrhythmogenic substrate has been gathered in the past decades. The ever-expanding therapeutic options require more insight in the selection of postinfarction patients at risk for developing life-threatening arrhythmias as well as a better understanding of which therapy should be selected for an individual patient. Ideally, methods should be developed that 1) are non-invasive in nature 2) allow mapping during sinus rhythm 3) allow ablation during sinus rhythm.\\nAim of this thesis was to gain more knowledge on the genesis of postinfarction arrhythmias by utilizing combined electrophysiologic and computational techniques that allow visualization and functional characterization of the mechanisms underlying postinfarction ventricular arrhythmias. In chapter 2 the clinical value of body surface mapping to guide antiarrhythmic surgery is investigated. In chapter 3 the electrophysiological basis for failure of body surface mapping to identify the correct site of origin of postinfarction VT was analyzed by means of simultaneous multi-lead endocardial and body surface mapping of VT. In chapter 4 new ways are explored that allow mapping of the postinfarction arrhythmogenic substrate during sinus rhythm. In chapter 5 the use of signal averaged electrocardiography for detection of late potentials is extended to electrocardiographic monitoring of the entire body surface area. The purpose was twofold: 1) to investigate whether the sensitivity of signal averaged electrocardiography for detection of patients at risk can be increased and 2) to analyze the potential of spatially distributed late potentials at the body surface to anatomically delineate areas of slow conduction within the left ventricle. In chapter 6 disparity in repolarization is investigated. Invasively obtained, spatially dense endocardial electrophysiologic repolarization measurements are compared with non-invasive ECG and body surface map parameters that are believed to estimate disparity in repolarization. In chapter 7 the physical principles that form the basis of the computational techniques used for analysis of the postinfarction arrhythmogenic substrate in this thesis are explained. Finally, in chapter 8 clinical implications of the currently presented work are discussed and future directives for arrhythmia research are suggested.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Eosinophils play an important role in allergic inflammatory diseases such as allergic asthma. Infiltrates of these cells are present in the interstitium and the lumen of the bronchi of asthmatic patients. Eosinophils must pass the endothelium to enter this site of inflammation. A widely accepted paradigm for leukocyte extravasation is\\r\\nthe multistep model. In this model selectins mediate rolling interactions between leukocytes and endothelium and subsequently, activated integrins facilitate firm adhesion and extravasation of the cells. The interactions between eosinophils and activated endothelial cells have been studied under flow conditions. This has been done in a flow chamber model in which a blood vessel is simulated.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn chapter 1 (general introduction) the multistep model of extravasation is explained. Furthermore, eosinophils function and their role in allergic asthma has been described.  \\r\\nIn chapter 2 data are presented on the function of alpha 4 integrins and E-selectin in the initial attachment of eosinophils to TNF-? activated endothelial cells. \\r\\nIn chapter 3 data are presented on the differences in adhesion behavior between eosinophils of healthy blood donors and of allergic asthmatic patients on activated endothelial cells under flow conditions. Remarkably, eosinophils of allergic asthmatic patients bound platelets in contrast to cells of healthy controls. The platelet-eosinophil interactions resulted in increased adhesion to activated endothelial cells via a process that is called \\x93 secondary tethering\\x94.\\r\\nIn chapter 4 data are presented on the role of IL-8 on eosinophil arrest. IL-8 is a typical neutrophil activator but is not known to be a eosinophil activator. We showed that IL-8 can induce 1) an alpha 4- and beta 2-integrin dependent arrest of rolling eosinophils on activated endothelial cells and 2) an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration of eosinophils binding to fibronectin and activated endothelial cells.  Thus, IL-8 is not only a neutrophil activator but also an eosinophil activator.\\r\\nIn chapter 5 data are presented on the role of phospholipase C (PLC) in the chemokine-induced integrin activation of eosinophils. Three chemokines, IL-8, eotaxin and C5a were tested on their ability to induce a PLC dependent arrest of eosinophils. Eotaxin mediated a totally PLC-dependent arrest whereas IL-8 and C5a only induced a partial PLC-dependent arrest. In resting eosinophils PLC is also important because inhibition of PLC decreased the functionality of alpha 4 integrins. \\r\\nIn chapter 6 data are presented on the migration behavior of eosinophils. Migrating cells display a typical tear-drop shape while migrating. The front is a broad protrusion (lamellipodium) whereas the back of the cell is a small point-like structure (uropod). The small GTP-ase RhoA was found to play an important role in the regulation of the movement of the uropod. \\r\\nIn chapter 7 (general discussion) the data of chapter 2-6 are discussed. Special emphasis was give to the validation of the model, the possible working mechanisms of PLC in integrin regulation, the role of platelets in the binding of eosinophils of allergic asthmatic patients to activated endothelial cells and possible target molecules for therapy.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Traumatic joint damage, articular cartilage and the research into methods of restoring the articulation are not new topics of interest. For centuries, clinicians have recognized the importance of cartilage damage and sought ways of learning about the normal form and function of hyaline cartilage as well as the process of degradation and restoration. Unfortunately, only some of the real problems have been solved partially, while a lot of basic knowledge has been available for centuries. More recently, tissue engineering was introduced as a method of restoring tissue or organ function, and has already been applied to cartilage repair. The possibility of modulating cells and tissues and applying this novel capability towards the restoration of musculoskeletal function provides great promise and opportunity for progress in orthopedics and traumatology. Currently, various strategies have been introduced for tissue engineering in cartilage repair, but so far no solid foundation for full clinical implementation has been established. Therefore, the general aim of this thesis is to investigate influences on cartilage tissue engineering and to identify areas where the outcome can be improved.\\r\\nGiven the history of the field of musculoskeletal research, it is important to realize the relativity of individual contributions and the constraints on  real progress  of scientific knowledge in time. No clearer can this be illustrated than by offering the reader insight in the historically available knowledge. As early as in old Egyptian civilization, descriptions of cartilage as a tissue and the relevance of articular degradation as a disease have been found. Scholars such as Aristoteles, Hippocrates and Leonardo da Vinci already contributed to these investigations, but were also the first to suggest that  If one way be better than another, that you may be sure is Nature s way  (Aristotle, 4th century B.C.) and  Human ingenuity makes inventions but none as beautiful, simple or to more purpose than Nature  (Leonardo da Vinci, 15th century). One of the first literature contributions on cartilage biology by the British surgeon William Hunter is a historic hallmark paper, which demonstrates the value and bright practical insight of (almost) forgotten knowledge, and provides the reader of this thesis with a solid grasp of what is important to orthopedic surgeons who perform their research in the field of cartilage repair and surgical intervention. Hunter s description of cartilage biology, though not as detailed as our current knowledge, is accurate, relevant and clear. The clinical problem colorfully described by Hunter remains largely unsolved, although we have fortunately progressed beyond the point at which our patients  submit unhappily to extirpation, a doubtful remedy, or wear out a painful though probably short life .'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['In preoperative risk management the anesthesiologist uses diagnostic information to estimate the probability of outcomes and to decide on the anesthetic strategy in a particular patient. The aim of this thesis was explore to what extent simple patient characteristics, particularly obtained from preoperative patient history and physical examination, could contribute to preoperative risk management. Furthermore, the implementation of outpatient preoperative evaluation (OPE) clinics in the Netherlands as well as the effects of OPE in a particular hospital were quantified.\\r\\nPreferably, during OPE, \\x91healthy\\x92 patients are easily distinguished from the remainder using a minimal but optimal set of diagnostic tests. Currently, the literature shows no evidence about the optimal contents of preoperative evaluation. To determine the optimal set of diagnostic tests to appropriately detect existing co-morbidity would require an empirical diagnostic study. In such a study the contribution of each diagnostic test is related to the diagnostic outcome, i.e. \\x91presence or absence of significant co-morbidity\\x92. To demonstrate how diagnostic research might be used in the clinical setting of an OPE clinic, we studied the diagnostic value of cardiac auscultation to detect VHD. Diagnostic research will decrease redundant information, but requires the a priori definition of what constitutes significant co-morbidity. \\r\\nThe anesthesiologist should also have evidence-based knowledge about the probability of perioperative complications and to what extent the anesthetic strategy may alter the complication rate. Prognostic prediction studies aim to estimate the probability of future occurrence of a particular outcome in a particular patient and are also suitable to estimate to what extent the individual risk of a patient can be modified using pre-emptive strategies, such as administering erythropoietin before surgery. Before a prediction model can be implemented in practice, its generalizability (the application to patients from a different but related population) should be estimated. To obtain an estimate of the generalizability, we applied two prediction models on perioperative blood transfusion to a patient population from another hospital. Both models stayed robust and we concluded that they could be implemented in practice. In this context, there will be an important role for information technology: a complication registration system could provide the necessary data for continuous prognostic prediction research, which in turn will provide risk stratification systems for (long-term) morbidity and mortality to be built-in in electronic patient record software used at the OPE clinic. \\r\\nThere are several potential benefits of OPE. For example, OPE allows for comprehensive assessment and optimization of the patient\\x92s health condition without delaying surgery. However, to extract the maximal benefits from OPE the incentives for all those concerned in preoperative patient care, such as anesthesiologists and surgical specialists, must be clear to change existing practice patterns, such as routine admission of patients to the ward the day before surgery. Because widespread implementation of OPE will require an increase in the number of anesthesiologists, the questions arises whether a specially trained anesthetic nurse can screen patients adequately. The partial substitution of the anesthesiologist by a specially trained nurse in a \\x91mixed-provider model OPE clinic\\x92 could have several benefits and might increase the quality and cost-effectiveness of OPE.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Dendritic cells (DCs) are widely recognized as professional antigen presenting cells (APCs) that play a pivotal role in directing the immune response. DCs are a heterogeneous cell population that continuously derive from bone marrow cells and reside as sentinels in an immature stage in the periphery. Upon encounter of an antigen, immature DCs migrate to the lymphoid organs. During this migration, DCs process the antigens they captured and express costimulatory molecules. Mature DCs present antigens captured in the periphery to T cells, inducing an adaptive immune response.\\r\\nThe subject of the research described in this thesis is the identification of human antibodies that bind to human DCs, the use of such antibodies for further examination of DC subsets and the evaluation of their potential as targeting vehicles for the delivery of tumor antigens to DCs for use in DC-based cancer vaccination strategies. The importance of DCs in generating an immune response has stimulated the exploration of these cells in cancer vaccines. Current DC-based vaccine approaches mostly rely on the ex vivo generation of DCs from precursor cells, which are subsequently loaded with tumor antigens and re-infused into patients to evoke an anti-tumor response. An alternative approach is provided by human antibodies as vectors for in vivo targeted delivery of tumor antigens to DCs.\\r\\nIn the search for suitable cell surface molecules expressed by DCs in peripheral blood and tonsil, we employed a phage antibody display approach to generate phage antibodies binding to cell surface molecules on DCs found in human peripheral blood and human tonsil. We obtained several phage antibodies with desirable characteristics, recognizing both DCs and their precursors the monocytes, which have been used as tools in further delineation of DC subsets.\\r\\nThese phage antibodies were converted to fully human monoclonal antibodies (huMabs) of the IgG4 isotype. Different DC subsets have been described based on phenotype, function and anatomical localization. The diversity of DC subsets and their potential role in polarization of the immune response, prompted us to determine in detail the reactivity patterns of our huMabs on in vivo DC subsets found at different anatomical localizations and in vitro generated DCs . In light of the potential application of our huMabs as tools to target antigens to DCs, we analyzed whether engagement of the molecules recognized by the huMabs exerted functional effects.\\r\\nIn a first step toward in vivo targeting of DCs in cancer immunotherapy, we explored whether antibody-mediated targeting of tumor antigens to DCs using a huMab as vector could provide a novel antigen delivery strategy. This strategy involves the construction of a eukaryotic expression vector encoding a huMab, genetically fused to a tumor antigen. We established proof of principle of this approach in an in vitro setting. The phage antibodies were also converted to lipid-tagged scFv antibody fragments. In a cell-based approach to cancer vaccination, we explored whether these lipid-tagged scFvs incorporated in tumor cells could induce receptor-mediated endocytosis by monocytes.\\r\\nIn conclusion, phage display antibody technology was successfully used to isolate four novel huMabs directed against DCs. In addition, a first step was made to evaluate the potential of modified forms of these huMabs as targeting vehicles for the delivery of tumor antigens. Targeting the antibody-tumor antigen fusion protein to DCs resulted in the induction of strong T helper and CTL responses. Future research on these huMabs in in vitro and in vivo models could open new and exciting avenues for cancer vaccination.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['This thesis addresses several problems related to sprained ankle syndrome. The purpose of this thesis is to evaluate the imaging features of sprained ankles, found on  new radiological modalities, and to assess the additional diagnostic understanding and treatment planning of helical CT as well as MR imaging compared with conventional radiographic imaging in patients with ankle and hindfoot problems. In addition recommendations for prudent / optimal use of both new modalities are proposed. \\r\\nThe objectives of this thesis are: (1.) Review and evaluation of the use of the Brodén view in subtalar joint instability; (2.) Study of MR images after ankle sprains, focused on osteochondral lesions in talar dome and tibia plafond; (3.) To report some MR imaging characteristics in detecting talocalcaneal coalitions; (4.) To investigate the accuracy of dynamic gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging in determining the viability of osteochondral lesions in the talar dome after inversion injury; (5) 5. To give an overview of some common sports-related injuries. The outline of the thesis is given hereunder:\\r\\nChapters 1-4 are introductory; Chapter 1 represents a general introduction. In Chapter 2 a review is given of clinical symptomatology, developmental embryology and anatomy, instability, ligaments, osteochondral plate and articular cartilage. Chapter 3 describes the classification systems of osteochondral lesions with conventional radiography, helical CT and MR imaging. Osteochondral lesions in relation with the talar dome and tibia plafond. The complex vascularisation of the talar dome is described and the nutrition of the articular cartilage. Etiology of bone edema in relation with (repetitive)trauma is reported. Chapter 4 discusses the imaging techniques used after ankle spraining. Conventional radiography, tomography, stress radiology, ultrasound, bone scintigraphy and arthrography. The imaging protocols of helical CT and MR imaging in specific ankle and hindfoot problems are evaluated.\\r\\nChapters 5-11 pertain to the performed scientific studies.\\r\\nChapter 5 reports a study of stress radiography and stress examination of the talocrural and subtalar joint on helical CT in 15 patients with unilateral instability. With stress radiography a variable amount of subtalar tilt was demonstrated in all feet. Chapter 6 evaluates the use of the Brodén view in subtalar joint instability. Helical CT didn t show tilting in the subtalar joint, except in the subluxated posteromedial part. Chapter 7 includes the results of posttraumatic osteochondral fractures of the talotibial joint in the relation with the tibia plafond. The high occurrence of  kissing  contusions is described. Chapter 8 viability of osteochondral fragments is an important parameter for healing. In this study dynamic gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging is compared with dynamic bone scintigraphy in OD lesions of the talar dome for evaluating the viability of the OD fragment. Chapter 9 concerns the MR imaging findings around the subtalar joint in 10 patients with talocalcaneal coalitions. A typical pattern of bone marrow hyperintensities in T2-weighted and STIR images is described. Chapter 10 discusses some common traumatic and overuse syndromes of the foot and ankle seen with MR imaging.\\r\\nChapter 11 contains a general discussion on helical CT as well as MR imaging in patients with ankle and hindfoot problems.\\r\\nConclusion of the thesis and general directions for proper use of both techniques are given.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Prediction of Spontaneous Preterm Birth'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Preterm birth is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. It is a major goal in obstetrics to lower the incidence of spontaneous preterm birth (SPB) and related neonatal morbidity and mortality. One of the principal objectives is to discover early markers that would allow us to identify subgroups of patients at high risk of SPB and, secondly, to manage those patients with an appropriate and effective strategy. \\n\\nThe purpose of this thesis was to provide data on prediction of spontaneous preterm birth. The studies described in this thesis aim to evaluate (1) which predictive tests are appropriate to use to identify women at risk for SPB; (2) what factors influence the predictive value of a diagnostic test in general and of cervical length assessment in particular; and (3) what strategies are used regarding threatened SPB in the specific Dutch obstetric care. \\n\\nIn chapter 2 we described the mechanisms contributing to SPB, which - mainly - have been identified during the past decade. SPB may result from one of the four primary pathogenic mechanisms, or from a combination: (1) activation of the maternal or fetal HPA axis; (2) inflammation (of ascending genital tract, systemic or chorion/decidual); (3) decidual hemorrhage and (4) pathologic distention of the uterus. The review in the second part of chapter 2 describes the usefulness of new biochemical fluid markers to identify women at risk for SPB. There are no current data to support the use of salivary estriol, home uterine monitoring and for other biochemical markers (e.g., corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), maternal serum ?-fetoprotein (MSAFP), interleukine-6 (Il-6) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)) larger studies are needed. In the general population no other risk factors than the obstetric history has proven to be effective. In the population at risk transvaginal ultrasonography to determine cervical length and fetal fibronectin testing, or a combination of both is likely to be useful in determining women at high risk for preterm labor. However, their clinical usefulness may rest primarily with their high negative predictive value, thereby avoiding unnecessary intervention. Only treatment with oral antibiotics of women with BV who are at risk for SPB has resulted in a reduction of SPB. Prophylactic treatment in women at risk for SPB, but without BV is not indicated.\\n\\nIn chapter 3 we described a study regarding the usefulness of possible novel markers matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 and MMP-9 in the prediction of SPB. MMP-1 levels in cervicovaginal secretions were low and did not change during either preterm or term labor. MMP-9 levels increased during term and preterm labor, with highest values in laboring patients with ruptured membranes, MMP-9 is not a useful predictor of preterm birth, but does play an important role in membrane rupture.\\n\\nIn chapter 4 and 5 we described the association of socio-demographic factors on the change of cervical length All women had a slight decrease of cervical length across gestation. Women who were African-American, under stress, or working as skilled manual laborers demonstrated significant shortening of the cervix during gestation. African-Americans delivered on average earlier (38.4 weeks) than the other race groups. All pregnancies displayed progressive cervical shortening except Asians. African-American women had shorter cervices across all 3 gestational age intervals even after controlling for preterm delivery. It suggests that shortening of the cervix is particularly a risk indicator for preterm birth in African-American women, since they already have shorter cervices to begin with. Measuring cervical length before 25 weeks gestation might not be of substantial contribution to the prediction of preterm birth in other ethnical groups. \\n\\nIn chapter 6 we evaluated the role of transvaginal ultrasonographic cervical length measurements for women with cervical incompetence. We determined that there was an increase in cervical length after cerclage. However, the degree of lengthening after cerclage was not predictive of term delivery.We alsoshowed that serial cervical length measurement in the late second or early third trimester predicted preterm birth. \\n\\nSince we were interested how predictors of SPB are implemented in the Dutch obstetric care. We developed a questionnaire to study opinions and management regarding threatened preterm birth, mutual co-operation and the \\x91VIL\\x92 between first line obstetrical practitioners (midwives and general practitioners practicing obstetrics) and gynecologists (Chapter 7). There appeared to be consensus among the three professional groups about the way that risk selection takes place. In chapter 8 we assessed the use of \\x91modern\\x92 diagnostic methods such as transvaginal sonographic measurements of cervical length, examination of bacterial vaginosis (BV) and fetal fibronectin (FFN) by Dutch gynecologists. Cervical length measurements are used by most of the Dutch gynecologists, even as testing and treating for BV. Fetal fibronectin testing - according to literature the best marker available now - is seldomly been used. Gynecologists in general hospitals without residency programs prescribe tocolytics and repeat corticosteroid treatment more often compared to the gynecologists in hospitals with residency programs. They prescribe less antibiotics for women with threatened preterm birth. Apparently 40% of Dutch gynecologists \\x91treat\\x92 preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) with tocolytics while there are no contractions.On some points the disciplines involved in obstetric care should adopt their guidelines to use the evidence from the literature. Use of FFN in the Dutch setting should be evaluated in the future.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['The Ubiquitin-Proteasome Pathway and the Regulation of Growth Hormone Receptor Availability'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Growth hormone (GH) promotes postnatal longitudinal growth in children and is active throughout an individual\\x92s live in protein, fat and carbohydrate metabolism. GH is an anabolic hormone, inducing a positive nitrogen balance and protein synthesis in muscle. The multiple actions of GH start when GH binds to the growth hormone receptor (GHR). The effectiveness of the peptide hormone depends on its presence in the circulation as well as the availability of receptors at the plasma membrane of target cells. The GHR is synthesized in most cells of the human body with high expression levels in liver and adipose tissue. Because of the rapid turnover of the GHR and the pulsatile secretion of GH into the circulation, controlling the number of GHR per cell is a crucial factor in the potential of the system. In this thesis we show that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway regulates the cell surface expression of the GHR, and thus the availability of the GHR for signalling. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe ubiquitin-proteasome pathway has been implicated in many cellular processes. Ubiquitination is a post-translational modification that can regulate protein levels, protein localization and receptor signalling. GHR ubiquitination occurs at the cell surface and coincides with receptor recruitment to clathrin-coated membrane domains, indicating that the ubiquitin-conjugation system and the classical endocytic machinery may cooperate to regulate the time-span of the GHR at the cell surface. The number of GHR at the cell surface is regulated by endocytosis and by shedding. GHR internalisation requires proteasome action in addition to an active ubiquitin-conjugation system. In the presence of specific proteasome inhibitors, GHR endocytosis and lysosomal degradation are inhibited. By comparing internalisation of the receptor with shedding of the GH-binding protein, we show that ubiquitin system-dependent internalisation followed by lysosomal degradation is the major pathway for receptor degradation. \\r\\n\\r\\nPlasma membrane proteins are essential for cells to communicate with the outside world, as well as to sense signals and changing conditions. The activity of plasma membrane proteins can be regulated by their number at the cell surface. In this thesis we established a role for the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in regulating the number of GHR at the cell surface. Nutritional state profoundly affects all levels of the GH/Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) axis. Changes due to fasting represents a condition known as GH resistance. High GH and low IGF-1 levels are characteristic for GH resistance, indicating reduced signalling via the GHR. Malnutrition and other catabolic states that have been associated with acquired GH insensitivity are accompanied by reduced GH-binding protein concentrations, increased protein turnover, and a negative nitrogen balance. Protein degradation exceeds synthesis in catabolic diseases and muscle atrophy will occur as seen in starvation, cancer cachexia, sepsis, renal failure, burns and AIDS. The enhanced proteolysis in these various pathological states is primarily due to activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. From our results it is expected that the upregulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway results in the downregulation of the GHR at the surface of target cells, thereby providing a possible explanation for the decreased protein synthesis in these patients'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Structural and functional studies on the pituitary-specific transcription factor Pit-1'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Pit-1 is a pituitary specific transcription factor that plays a central role in the development and maintenance of a number of cell lineages in the anterior pituitary gland. In these cell lineages, Pit-1 is required for the selective expression of the growth hormone (GH), prolactin (PRL) and the b-subunit of the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSHb). Pit-1 contains a POU DNA-binding domain, which consist of two independent DNA-binding modules (the POU-specific domain (POUs) and the POU-homeodomain (POUhd)), separated by a flexible linker. Loss of Pit-1 function leads to combined pituitary hormone deficiency (CPHD) syndrome, the main feature of which is dwarfism.\\r\\nChapter II of this thesis describes a clinical case study of a CPHD patient carrying two novel mutations (each on a different allele) in both the POUs and the POUhd. One of these mutations, located in the POUs, substitutes one of the hydrophobic core residues with a charged residue, which leads to a misfolded POUs domain that is unable to bind DNA. The other mutation leads to the deletion of the entire DNA-recognition helix from the POUhd. In the context of the full-length POU-domain, neither of these mutants was capable of high-affinity DNA-binding in vitro or stimulation of the Pit-1 target promoters in vivo. \\r\\nThe expression of GH, PRL and TSHb is highly restricted to their respective cell lineage, while Pit-1 is present in all three cell lineages. Therefore, Pit-1 needs to cooperate with other transcription regulators in order to silence or activate its target promoters. The interaction of Pit-1 with two such factors, Ets-1 and GATA-2, is studied in chapter III. Ras-responsive Ets-1 cooperates with Pit-1 to synergistically activate the PRL promoter, which contains composite Ets-1 / Pit-1 recognition sites. However, both proteins can also associate in solution, in absence of DNA. This physical interaction involves the POUhd of Pit-1 and a part of the region III activation domain of Ets-1. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) monitored protein-protein titrations, we were able to study which residues on the POUhd are likely contacted by the minimal interacting region of Ets-1. The NMR data suggests that Ets-1 binds the POUhd through multiple interacting regions. Interestingly, the affinity of two of these regions on the POUhd may be influenced by post-translational modifications (phosphorylation and possibly acetylation). \\r\\nSince the interaction interface on the POUhd for both DNA and Ets-1 binding overlap to a large extent, it would not be surprising if the DNA binding affinity of the POUhd were somehow affected by Ets-1. However, the study described in chapter IV shows that, at least for the minimal interaction domain of Ets-1, this is not the case. \\r\\nFinally, chapter V investigates the functional relevance of a novel interaction of the conserved region 3 (CR-3) of the 13S splice variant of the adenovirus immediate early gene product (E1A 13S) with the N-terminal activation domain of Pit-1. Transient co-transfection of Pit-1 with E1A 13S showed an inhibitory effect of E1A 13S on Pit-1 mediated stimulation of the GH and PRL promoters.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Struggles in prescribing : determinants of psychotropic drug use in multiple clinical settings'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['The main objectives of this thesis were to establish the prevalence of psychotropic drug use as well as possible determinants associated with its use in multiple clinical settings: psychiatric admission wards, an intensive care unit and two settings for the intellectually disabled. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn this thesis, we evaluated the question which class of antipsychotics is prescribed preferentially in newly admitted patients on psychiatric admission wards and the determinants affecting this decision. We found that the most frequently prescribed oral antipsychotic drugs were classical agents. Initial choice for short-acting parenteral classical antipsychotics was significantly associated with follow-up prescriptions of oral classical antipsychotics. We predict that upcoming introductions of short-acting parenteral formulations of atypical agents are likely to have a large impact on the subsequent oral antipsychotic treatment. In another study on psychiatric admission wards, we looked at the temporal relationship between the use of antipsychotics and seclusion. Antipsychotic treatment in patients with psychotic disorders was significantly associated with a delay of seclusion and, although not statistically significant, with a lower risk of seclusion. Furthermore, in a substantial proportion of the patients, antipsychotic therapy was only initiated during or directly following seclusion with a relative risk of 2.0 (95% confidence interval: 1.2-3.4). Our findings suggest that, in patients with psychotic disorders, not using antipsychotics is associated with aggression or violence for which seclusion is needed. Pharmacological treatment seems inevitable for a substantial proportion of secluded psychotic patients.\\r\\n\\r\\nFurthermore, we studied determinants of psychotropic drug use in a general intensive care unit (ICU). The prevalence of psychotropic drug use was 42.3%. Benzodiazepines were used in 35.8% of the patients, frequently at a high dosage. Antipsychotics were prescribed in 17.5% of all patients, typically in low dosages. The association of severe disease, a long ICU stay and an admission for non-surgical reasons with psychotropic drug use may be an indication that severely ill patients are likely to suffer from a delirium. In this study, patients who used psychotropic drugs (cases) acted as their own controls because days of drug exposure were compared to those of non-exposure and no corrections were made with the fact that observations were correlated. We compared this design with a logistical binomial model to adjust for correlated measures, or cluster effects through repeated measures and found that, although adjustment did not result in major changes in the odds ratios found, adjustment has greater effect with more observations per cluster. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn a study in group homes for intellectually disabled residents, the point prevalence of psychotropic drug use in a problem behaviour group (PBG) was compared to a random group (RG) of residents and possible determinants of group membership were studied. Psychotropics were used by 52.6% of the problem behaviour group and by 22.8% of the random group. Young age, psychotic, anxiety and aggression symptoms were significantly associated with the PBG. Remarkably, a low prevalence of antidepressants, mood stabilisers, antipsychotics and anxiolytics in patients with the corresponding symptoms was found. This suggests that a considerable number of residents remain undertreated. In addition, we examined the prevalence and possible determinants of multiple psychotropic drug use in intellectually disabled patients with mild intellectual disabilities admitted to a specialised closed psychiatric ward for prolonged treatment and rehabilitation. Multiple drug use was found in half of the patients. Psychotropics were used in high dosages and there was a tendency to prescribe multiple drugs for patients with duration of stay longer than a year. Furthermore, psychotic disorder, aggressive, bizarre, attention seeking behaviour and involuntary measures were associated with multiple psychotropic drug use. It is likely that these findings, especially the association with aggressive and attention seeking behaviour, indicate difficulties in the management of patients with socially disruptive behaviour.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Prospective research supports the therapeutic effect of sex reassignment (SR) for adolescent and adult transsexuals. Data were used from 345 patients who applied for SR. Of these applicants, 232 started hormone treatment, 113 did not. The group who completed SR consisted of 196 transsexuals. Follow-up data were gathered one to five years after SR.\\n \\nThe results of 171 treated adult transsexuals showed improvement in many areas of functioning after SR. The main symptom for which the patients had requested treatment, gender dysphoria, had disappeared after treatment, which is the primary goal of SR. Improvement was also found in satisfaction of the patients with their sex characteristics. In addition, according to observers, the appearance of the transsexuals better matched that of the desired new gender after treatment. Psychological functioning of the group had also improved after SR. Most of the transsexuals also functioned well socially, sexually, and in the new gender role. Above all, the vast majority of the group expressed no feelings of regret about their SR. However, a few individuals expressed reservations about the beneficial effects of treatment at follow-up. In particular, one male-to-female expressed strong regret and another some feelings of regret, during and after treatment. Both assigned these feelings to the adverse reactions from society.\\n\\nBy far the least explored and most controversial domain with respect to SR is early (hormone) treatment with adolescent transsexuals. Results of the present study support the decision to refer well-functioning adolescents for early (between 16 to 18 years) hormone treatment, considering the positive outcomes of SR on several areas of postoperative functioning of this group. Within the treated adolescent group the gender dysphoria was absent after SR. The adolescents also appeared to function quite well socially and psychologically, and they were more satisfied with their sex characteristics as well after SR. Not a single adolescent expressed feelings of regret concerning the decision to undergo SR.\\n\\nOther findings from this thesis led us to conclude that the distinction between subtypes of transsexuals is theoretically and clinically meaningful. The differences that were found between homosexual and nonhomosexual transsexuals suggest different developmental routes for each of these subtypes. The road along which the nonhomosexual subtype evolves the gender identity conflict is most likely to be accompanied with more obstacles. Taking into account that the nonhomosexuals were found to be psychologically more vulnerable than the homosexuals, especially before treatment, they may require additional guidance during treatment.\\n\\nFinally, we investigated which factors at assessment could predict the course and outcomes of SR. Eligibility for SR was largely based upon the factors gender dysphoria, psychological stability, and physical appearance. Transsexuals with a nonhomosexual preference, psychological instability, and strong dissatisfaction about their appearance, at assessment, are more at risk for worse postoperative functioning and more dissatisfaction after treatment.\\n\\nTo conclude, the current study substantiates findings from previous, mainly retrospective, studies, that SR is indeed effective. However, alleviation of the gender identity problem is not equivalent with an easy life. Yet, for most of the transsexuals who participated in this study, the strict eligibility criteria and the standard professional guidance as currently provided, appears to be sufficient to help resolve their gender identity conflict.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['* Background and Purpose:\\r\\nCarotid endarterectomy has been shown to be beneficial in symptomatic patients with a severe stenosis (70-99%) of the internal carotid artery (ICA). Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is the standard of reference in the diagnosis of carotid artery stenosis, but has a relatively high complication rate. In this thesis in a diagnostic study and a cost-effectiveness analysis we investigated whether DSA could be replaced by non-invasive testing.  \\r\\n* Methods:\\r\\nIn a prospective diagnostic study we performed duplex ultrasound (DUS), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), and DSA on 350 consecutive symptomatic patients. Stenoses were measured with the observers blinded for clinical information and other test results. Separate and combined test results of DUS and MRA were compared with DSA. Only the stenosis measurements of the arteries on the symptomatic side were included in the analyses. A cost-effectiveness analysis, integrating diagnostic accuracy, acute complications, long term outcomes, costs and quality of life was performed by means of a diagnostic and prognostic model.  Additionally, in this thesis further test specific characteristics of MRA were studied and patients  preferences for DSA, MRA, and DUS were investigated. \\r\\n*Results:\\r\\nDUS analysed with previously defined criteria resulted in a sensitivity of 87.5% (95%CI, 82.1%-92.9%) and a specificity of 75.7% (95%CI, 69.3%-82.2%) in identifying severe ICA stenosis (70-99%). Stenosis measurements on MRA yielded a sensitivity of 92.2% (95%CI, 86.2%-96.2%) and a specificity of 75.7% (95%CI, 68.6%-82.5%). Combining MRA and DUS results, agreement between these two modalities (84% of patients) gave a sensitivity of 96.3% (95%CI, 90.8%-99.0%) and a specificity of 80.2% (95%CI, 73.1%-87.3%) for identifying severe stenosis. The use of DUS, MRA, and the combination of DUS and MRA resulted in comparable outcomes in terms of QALYs and total lifetime costs, whereas DSA resulted in QALY loss and higher costs.\\r\\n* Conclusions:\\r\\nBoth DUS and MRA are accurate diagnostic tests to detect carotid artery stenosis. Particularly if DUS and MRA are in agreement, the combined test result has a high sensitivity and specificity, making DSA redundant for the decision whether carotid endarterectomy should be performed. In the event of disagreement DSA may be considered. In the majority of patients it is more effective and less expensive to replace DSA by the combination of DUS and MRA.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['This thesis shows the results and patient characteristics of three studies. One study was part of the Dutch Mite Avoidance Study (DUMAS): Effectiveness and effect modification of encasings in house dust mite allergy. The two other studies were two different studies with asthmatic patients recruited from and performed at the asthma centre Heideheuvel. Patient recruitment of the Heideheuvel study took place in the same geographical region in the period 1995-1997; the DUMAS study in 1997 and 1998. \\n\\nIn the DUMAS study patients were selected by using questionnaires where particular atopical core questions were addressed, together with a positive intradermal test or skin prick test for house dust mite. Patients were diagnosed as having reported AR, AA and/or AD on basis of this questionnaire. Then patients were randomised and stratified by age and recruiting centre. After randomisation patients were tested for AA with lung function tests (methacholine, adenosine, histamine); for AR, using nasal provocation tests with HDM and the nasal-score2; and for AD, using the LSS for symptom grading and disease extent together with tests for allergen load and immunological and quality of life (QoL) variables. A difference in diagnoses was made by using questionnaires solely (reported diagnoses) and using questionnaires in combinations with clinical tests (clinical diagnoses). A difference between reported and clinical diagnoses was found in 84 out of 325 patients (25.8 %)(Chapter 2). There was a reported atopical comorbidity of 235 out of 325 patients (72.3 %) and a clinical atopical comorbidity of 177 in 325 patients (54.4 %). \\n\\nChapters 3, 4 and 5 show the effects of encasings on clinical, immunological and QoL variables. There was a lack of improvement of AD and AA in the active treatment groups  despite a significant decrease in Der p1 and Der p1 + f1 exposure.\\n\\nQoL becomes an important issue in evaluating effects of treatment in patients with chronic diseases. Several disease specific and generic questionnaires have been developed. Disease specific questionnaires assess the severity of particular disease specific (AA and AD) symptoms on patient\\x92s life while generic questionnaires addresses the general \\x93well being\\x94. Looking at the prevalence of atopic comorbidity within the selected populations, usage of both kinds of questionnaires is recommended (Chapter 6)\\nLack of clinical effect of encasings on AA and AD resulted in a lack in improvement of QoL between the placebo and active treatment groups as measured with disease specific and generic questionnaires in both study populations (Chapter 5, 6, 7, 8). Interestingly, within the AD population the disease specific QCSD and the generic SF-36 questionnaire revealed body-site specific effects of trunk and arms on QoL (Chapter 7, 8)'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Human granulocytes play an important role in host defense by mediating inflammatory responses to invading microorganisms. Defects in granulocyte differentiation or improper functioning of these cells can lead to disease pathogenesis. Granulocyte maturation, priming and activation are under the control of cytokines and chemoattractants. This study focuses on the intracellular signaling mechanism regulating granulocyte differentiation and functioning. To address this, several points of research or questions were investigated.\\n1) What are the roles of intracellular pathways in the cytokine induced maturation of hematopoietic progenitors towards granulocytes ? \\nTo address this question, an in ex-vivo differentiation model was developed, in which isolated umbilical cord blood CD34+ progenitors were differentiated towards neutrophils. In Chapter 2 we have investigated the differences in the maturation program induced by G-CSF or a combination of IL-3 and G-CSF. By using pharmacological inhibitors we demonstrate the importance of PI3K and MEK in the maturation process of hematopoietic progenitors towards neutrophils. \\n2) Identification of novel kinases present in human granulocytes.\\nSince granulocytes have specific effector functions we hypothesized that specific signaling molecules could be present in these cell. To this purpose we describe in Chapter 3 polymerase chain reaction analysis using degenerate primers against conserved regions of kinases, leading to the identification of CKLiK. We characterize CKLiK as a Ca2+ and calmodulin dependent kinase, whose expression is restricted to granulocytes. For analysis of the role of CKLiK in granulocyte functioning, we describe in Chapter 4 the role of Ca2+ and calmodulin regulated pathways by using a Ca2+ ionophore and a calmodulin antagonist. In Chapter 5 we describe the regulation and functional characterization of CKLiK in human granulocytes, by using an antibody against CKLiK and an cell permeable inhibitory peptide. \\n3) What genes are regulated by cytokines in human granulocytes?\\nExposure of inflammatory mediators, such as GM-CSF, to mature granulocytes leads to a pre-activated or primed phenotype. In Chapter 6 we identified GM-CSF regulated genes, by a differential display technology, in which the gene encoding 5-lipoxygenase activating protein was identified as a cytokine regulated gene in vitro as well as in vivo (Chapter 6). \\nTaken together this thesis provides novel insights into granulocyte signal transduction pathways and identifies new signals that can control granulocyte maturation, priming, activation and functioning.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a common disease of men beyond middle age. In a lot of these men, BPH is associated with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Depending on the degree of bothersomeness of these LUTS, the patient will seek medical treatment. As BPH progresses, the hyperplastic tissue may obstruct the urinary flow during voiding. The lifetime probability of surgical treatment of men for BPH is about 30%.\\nAccurate diagnosis of BPH and patient classification should result in improvements in treatment for this disease. The aims of this thesis were to evaluate different diagnostic methods and their associations in well-defined groups of men with LUTS suggestive of BPH.  Besides, we estimated the prevalence and bothersomeness of LUTS and their impact on well being, and quantified the diagnostic value and overlap of the different diagnostic investigation methods and combination of methods.\\nWe evaluated 565 patients with LUTS suggestive of BPH who visited the outpatient clinic of Urology in the period 1993 until 2000. Also 14 healthy volunteers without LUTS and 17 volunteers with LUTS were involved in the study. The following evaluations were performed: medical history, physical examination including digital rectal examination, urinalysis and renal function assessment, uroflowmetry and residual urine estimation, quantification of symptoms, bothersome and quality of life with questionnaires, determination of the prostate size by transrectal ultrasound, and urodynamic investigations (filling cystometry and pressure-flow studies). Besides, patients were asked to complete voiding diaries for (at least) three 24-hour periods.\\nReporting correctly on frequency-volume charts during just 24 hour is sufficient to gain insight into the voiding habits of a patient with LUTS suggestive of BPH. Symptoms and their bothersomeness and urodynamic evaluations show different aspects of BPH and complement each other. Usual urodynamic findings in patients with LUTS were also found in healthy volunteers without LUTS.\\nWe excluded men with severe and prolonged obstruction, because of resulting (starting) decompensation of the bladder. In de included patients we found a decreasing bladder capacity and an increasing residual volume at increasing obstruction grade. As a result the effective bladder capacity decreased remarkably. The \"shrinking bladder\" plays a prominent role in the bothersomeness of men with (starting) BPH. \\nUrodynamic investigations improve diagnosis. Because urodynamic investigations are in the urologic world not always performed in men with LUTS suggestive of BPH, a \"Bladder Outlet Obstruction Number\" (BOON) was introduced, based on three easily available, non-invasive, parameters. BOON can be used to predict the possibility of the presence or absence of infravesical obstruction.'],\n",

Although majority of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) are commensals that generally do not cause severe clinical problems, some, including Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus, may cause clinically relevant infections and bactereamia related to indwelling devices. In addition, one third of healthy humans carry Staphylococcus aureus, which may cause severe invasive disease. S. aureus accounts for the majority of nosocomial infections around the world, causing high mortality when untreated. Several types of antibiotics, directed to different targets in bacterial metabolism, were employed to fight infections caused by S. aureus. However, S. aureus has acquired resistance to most extant antibiotics, including vancomycin, and evolved to be one of the most difficult-to-treat pathogens in hospitals. This thesis describes the essential role of horizontal gene transfer between the chromosomes of different staphylococci in the dissemination of resistance genes.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['This thesis deals about mechanical support in en-stage heart failure. The introduction provides an overview of some clinical aspects of heart failure and the pathofysiology, focussing on remodeling. Chapter 2 reports the results of 38 patients undergoing implantation of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) as a bridge to heart transplantation. 87 % survived the first postoperative month, and 76 % of the patients were successfully transplanted after a mean duration of support of 206±129 days. In chapter 3 exercise performance of patients supported by a LVAD is reported.  Twelve weeks after LVAD implantation peak VO2 is comparable to that at 12 weeks and one year after heart transplantation (peak VO2: 22.8±5.3, 24.6±3.3 and 26.2±3.8 ml/kg/min, respectively). Therefore, with regard to exercise capacity an LVAD is fully compatible with activities of normal daily life. Chapter 4 describes the histologic features of cardiomyocytes, with emphasis on the contractile proteins. At the time of LVAD implantation widespread distortion of the staining pattern of the thin contractile proteins and titin was seen. In contrast, myosin staining pattern was preserved. After LVAD support, during a period of 213±135 days, the thin contractile proteins and titin showed improvement, but no normalization. Cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area decreased 36% after LVAD support, but also did not normalize. The persistence of severe structural myocyte damage in this study group does not support complete recovery of myocyte histologic features after a period of unloading of the heart by LVAD support. Chapter 5  focuses on cardiomyocyte cell death in patients with end-stage heart failure, before and after LVAD support. Before LVAD support apoptosis incidence was low (0.8% of cardiomyocytes), further decreasing after support (0.1% of cardiomyocytes). The apoptosis inducing mediators and their receptors were all present before and after LVAD support. The apoptosis inhibitory protein FLIP was widely expressed in cardiomyocytes before and after LVAD support, with m-RNA levels comparable to that in normal controls. This may suggest that FLIP is an important factor in the prevention of cardiomyocyte apoptosis.\\nChapter 6 reports the comparison of the morphology of the contractile proteins in biopsies of the left- and right ventricle and the interventricular septum to investigate if right ventricular biopsies might be used to monitor reverse remodeling in the left ventricle. The staining pattern of all these biopsies was identical. Furthermore, small biopsies taken with a diagnostic bioptome were representative for the histologic findings of the myofilaments in larger biopsies. With regard to the morphology of the contractile proteins, prospective biopsies of the right ventricle may be a way of monitoring reverse remodeling of the left ventricle during LVAD support.\\nChapter 7 is a general discussion of the results of the investigations included in this thesis. Probably, mechanical circulatory support can be used in the near future as an alternative to heart transplantation. The use of mechanical support as a bridge to recovery of cardiac function in end-stage heart failure is presently highly experimental and unpredictable.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Surgical aspects of pediatric urinary incontinence'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['This thesis tries to bridge between functional and structural non-neuro- genic incontinence and to give insight in the surgical options. Children with anatomically based bladder neck and urethral insufficiency often present with the same symptoms as children with genuine non-neurogenic functional incontinence. Bladder neck insufficiency causes urine to leak into the proximal urethra and urine in the proximal urethra is one of the triggers of the micturition reflex with detrusor contraction and sphinc- teric relaxation as a result. Children with an insufficient bladder neck are constantly counteracting this micturition reflex by pelvic floor contraction and can present with typical symptoms of true dysfunctional voiding. Constant awareness of these facts is mandatory for all the members of the team. The urologist should be very meticulous in the endoscopic and ultrasound judgement of the anatomy of the bladder, the bladder neck and the urethra. Video-urodynamic studies must be interpreted with the assumption that  derailment of the Wolffian duct can be a cause of the incontinence. The urotherapist must know that some children  cannot be cured by biofeedback treatment and eventually will need an operation to get rid of the urinary incontinence. The physical therapist is the only per- son that can specifically teach the child to use the puborectalis muscle instead of all the muscles around. This is an underestimated task because many  physical  therapists  do  not  realise  that  this  result  can  only  be obtained by invasive treatment with rectal examination and biofeedback training by anal balloon expulsion. Meanwhile, the physical therapist must be aware of the rare neurogenic anomalies that sometimes can be over- looked by urodynamic studies. The psychologists and all the members of the team should realise the psychological impact of incontinence, some- times  combined  with  malformations  of the  external  genitalia, on  the behaviour of a child. Any child with a handicap copes with the disability by eleminating the concerning part of the body from the self-image. The resulting ignoring behaviour of the child that should be interpreted as a natural defence mechanism to cope with the disability is  commonly mis- interpreted as a behavioural disorder by parents and therapists. Finally one must realise that also children with structural anatomically based inconti- nence  as  in  bladder  extrophy  and  epispadias  as  well  as  children  with ambiguous genitalia often need to be treated by the team of urotherapists and physical therapists to accomodate the function of the restored anato- my to the daily life situation.. Moreover, in many cases these children need specific guidance for gender identity and psychosexual development by a team that is specialised in dealing with ambiguous genitalia in childhood. The chapters in this thesis describe functional incontinence and many aspects of structural incontinence in childhood. The main objective in the treatment of the different patient groups has been  to minimise morbidity and health care consumption in patient groups that historically present with chronic lower urinary tract problems. Our approach to ectopic urete- roceles, in our opinion, reduces the morbidity as much as possible. More research in this field by other groups will be neccessary to prove this fact. The Otis-urethrotomy victims, when untreated, are bound to life-long uri- nary incontinence with many frustrating events by failing therapies. Our approach for girls with ambiguous genitalia has been able to reduce the work-load of the urotherapists in this group of patients to zero, in con- trast to their work load in the relatively large group of patients that has been  treated  by  historic  schedules  resulting  in  non-neurogenic bladder/sphincter  dysfunction  and/or  urinary  tract  infections  in  the majority of the patients. The treatment of female epispadias as presented in this thesis appears to reduce the morbidity and the number of surgical procedures for the patients. Further an extensive overview of the treatment of extrophia vesicae (open bladder) and of epispadias is presented.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['For 50 years, glucocorticoids (GC) are used for symptomatic treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In the last decade, results from clinical studies of treatment with GC as additional therapy to long-acting antirheumatic drugs in patients with early RA suggested also disease-modifying properties of GC in RA.\\nThe aim of this thesis was to investigate disease-modifying properties and side effects of low-dose GC as monotherapy of patients with previously untreated early active RA in relation to clinical efficacy, general wellbeing and glucocorticoid receptors.\\nAll 81 consecutive outpatients who participated in the clinical 2-year study had recently been diagnosed as having early RA (disease duration less than a year). According to randomization 41 patients were allocated to 10 mg prednisone orally daily and 40 to placebo. Additional therapies like analgesics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), physiotherapy were allowed in both groups and recorded. After 6 months sulphasalazine 2 gram daily could be prescribed as rescue medication only if clinically necessary. According to the study protocol clinical, biochemical and radiologic parameters were assessed. Furthermore, health assessment questionnaires for disability and general wellbeing were performed regularly and side effects documented.\\nIn general, patients in the prednisone group experienced significant but transient clinical improvement in the first months compared to those in the placebo group. However, patients in the placebo group used twice as much additional therapies compared to those in the prednisone group. To put it the other way around, prednisone had a sparing effect on the use of NSAIDs and other additional therapies. \\nFrom 12 months on, radiological scores showed significantly less progression of joint damage (erosions and joint space narrowing) in the prednisone group compared to the placebo group.\\nNo clinically relevant side effects were observed, except for a higher incidence of new osteoporotic vertebral fractures in the prednisone group. At the time of the design of the study, back in 1989, it was considered ethical to study RA patients with an active drug against placebo; nowadays such a study design would be unethical because we know that joint damage is an early feature of the disease and early and aggressive therapy is now advocated. Moreover, suppletion with only 500 mg calcium daily was prescribed; nowadays potent anti-osteoporotic treatment with biphosphonates inhibits the negative effects of prednisone on bone and reduce fracture rate. In our study, a non-significant reduction of bone mineral density (BMD) was observed in the prednisone group as opposed to a higher vertebral fracture rate: changes in bone structure and strength rather than diminished BMD could explain, at least partially, the higher incidence of fractures.\\nFrom our results, no significant changes were observed in the GR-expression (number and affinity) and serum cortisol levels in both groups. So, it seems unlikely that GR-expression plays a major role in the aethiopatogenesis of RA. Also, no predictive values could be found for the response on GC treatment. No correlations between GR-number, radiological scores and BMD was found.\\nWe were able to study a unique group of early DMARD-naïve patients with RA, treated with a low-dose prednisone without bias, an opportunity not likely to recur. We demonstrated a powerful disease-modifying effect of prednisone in the early phase of RA. This is in concordance with results of other recent studies in early RA. There seems to be a ´window of opportunity´ in the first 2 years of the disease in which aggressive therapy limits joint destruction over time. In this treatment we advocate a low dose prednisone, in combination with other DMARDs. Future studies should concentrate on the lowest possible effective dose in combination therapy'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Cryptococcosis is the leading cause of life-threatening mycological disease of the central nervous system, with a high worldwide mortality and morbidity in immunocompromised patients.In the Netherlands from 1996 on incidence numbers are declining, in parallel with incidence numbers in the rest of the Western world. This decline is due to the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). In countries that can not afford costs of HAART, like for example in Sub Saharan Africa and India, cryptococcal related infection are an enormous problem. \\nC. neoformans enters the body by inhalation of poorly encapsulated yeast cells. In the lungs innate immune responses like phagocytosis of C. neoformans by resident macrophages (alveolar macrophages) take place. We developed a new, rapid and objective method to measure interaction between the yeast C. neoformans and adherent phagocytic cells. This method was used to investigate if surfactant proteins like surfactant protein A and D play a role in innate host defense against cryptococci.In contrast to many other micro-organisms like E. coli, M. tuberculosis and influenza A virus, pulmonary surfactant proteins do not support phagocytosis of C. neoformans. \\n Cytokines that are present during the initiation ofresponse will determine whether CMI or B-cell development will take place. The time kinetics of cytokine release in PBMC of healthy donors stimulated with cryptococcal capsular polysaccharides indicate an autocrine-paracrine network regulation of the cytokines. Proinflammatory cytokines like TNF-aDPAF, IL-8 and fMLP. Another capsular component of C. neoformans Mannoprotein 4 (MP4) was found to potent inhibitor of PMN migration. \\nNeutrophil infiltration into the central nervous system is a dual-edged sword in that it protects the tissue from infection and injury but can also be detrimental to the host. In diseases such as bacterial meningitis or cerebrovascular ischemia there is evidence that a high influx of PMN plays an adverse role in the pathogenesis of neurological damage Accordingly, it is now assumed that adjunctive therapeutic strategies with anti- inflammatory agents may favor neurological recovery. Therefore we will investigate the possibilities to use GXM and MP4 therapeutically.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['5-HT1B receptors and serotonin function : microdialysis studies in rats and knockout mice'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['The serotonergic system is an important target in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely used in the treatment of depression and anxiety disorders, but a clinical problem is the delayed therapeutic effect. This delayed onset of action suggests that adaptive changes may occur. Previous pre-clinical studies have indicated a role of 5-HT autoreceptors in the effects of SSRIs. Moreover, dysfunction of 5-HT1B receptors has been associated with aggression, impulsivity, alcoholism and drug abuse. More insight in the functional role of 5-HT1B receptors contributes to our understanding of this receptor in psychiatric disorders. \\nThe studies described in this thesis investigated the role of 5-HT1B receptors in serotonin (5-HT) function in rats and in genetically modified mice lacking 5-HT1B receptors. The central serotonergic system is complex as 5-HT exerts its function through fourteen different receptor subtypes. In the mammalian brain, 5-HT1B receptors are expressed either as inhibitory 5-HT autoreceptors or as 5-HT1B heteroreceptors. The 5-HT1B autoreceptors are localized on serotonergic nerve terminals controlling 5-HT release. The 5-HT1B heteroreceptors are present on non-serotonergic neurons, suggesting that these receptors modulate other neurotransmitters and are involved in a variety of functions. \\nA limitation in research on 5-HT1B receptors has been the relative restricted selectivity of 5-HT1B receptor antagonists. Therefore, the generation of 5-HT1B knockout (KO) mice has provided an interesting model to study 5-HT1B receptors. Activation of 5-HT1B autoreceptors reduces the release of 5-HT. Thus in the absence of 5-HT1B autoreceptors, increased extracellular 5-HT levels and an increased response to SSRIs may be expected. In the hippocampus of 5-HT1B KO mice an increased 5-HT response after systemic administration of the SSRI paroxetine was found. To further examine the contribution of terminal autoreceptors on 5-HT levels, and to circumvent possible effects of raphe 5-HT autoreceptors, a SSRI was locally administered into the brain structures of interest by reversed microdialysis. Augmented 5-HT levels following local SSRI administration were found in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, but not in the striatum of mice lacking 5-HT1B receptors. In wildtype mice, stimulation of 5-HT1B receptors with CP-93,129, a 5-HT1B receptor agonist, reduced 5-HT output, also in the striatum, indicating that these autoreceptors are functionally present in this genotype. \\nNAS-181, a new rodent 5-HT1B receptor antagonist, was used to block 5-HT1B receptors. NAS-181 was found to be a potent 5-HT1B receptor antagonist in rat frontal cortex. The effects of a SSRI on extracellular 5-HT in the prefrontal cortex in mice and rats were augmented by 5-HT1B receptor blockade with NAS-181. The studies in mice and rats described in this thesis clearly show that 5-HT1B autoreceptors limit the acute effects of local administration of a SSRI in the hippocampus and frontal cortex. The results obtained in mice indicate some evidence for compensatory changes in 5-HT1B KO mice, supporting the importance of 5-HT1B receptors in 5-HT neurotransmission. The main advantage of a knockout model is its selectivity. In addition, the 5-HT1B receptor antagonist NAS-181 can be a valuable pharmacological tool to study 5-HT1B receptors in rodents. \\nThe role of 5-HT1B heteroreceptors in dopamine release was studied in mice dorsal striatum. Local administration of the 5-HT1B receptor agonist CP-93,129 increased DA outflow in 5-HT1B KO mice to the same extent as wildtype mice, indicating that the DA effect this compound can not be attributed to stimulation of 5-HT1B receptors. The previous reported role of 5-HT1B heteroreceptors in striatal dopamine release could not be confirmed in mice lacking 5-HT1B receptors.\\nConcluding, 5-HT1B autoreceptors limit the acute effects of 5-HT reuptake inhibition in hippocampus and frontal cortex, but not in the striatum. These findings support the idea that blockade of 5-HT1B autoreceptors may be a potential interesting augmentation strategy for treatment with SSRIs. In contrast to the well-established role of 5-HT1B autoreceptors, relative little is known about 5-HT1B heteroreceptors. Our study could not confirm a role 5-HT1B heteroreceptors in striatal dopamine release. The 5-HT1B KO mice may be an interesting to further study the functional role of 5-HT1B heteroreceptors.'],\n",

The primary objective of the Octopus Study was to compare cognitive outcome between patients randomized to off-pump or on-pump CABG. \\nIn chapter 2, the literature suggesting that CABG may impair cognitive function is systematically reviewed and chapter 3 describes in detail the rationale and design of the Octopus Study.\\nIn chapter 4, the cerebral outcome and quality of life after off-pump and on-pump CABG are presented. From March 1998 through August 2000, 281 patients were enrolled. At 3 and 12 months after surgery, there was no difference in quality of life between the two groups. At 3 months, cognitive decline (or stroke) occurred in 21% in the off-pump group and 29% in the on-pump group (relative risk 0.65; 95% CI 0.36-1.16; p=0.15).

Completeness of revascularization was similar in both groups. Blood products were needed during 3% of the off-pump procedures and 13% of the on-pump procedures (p<0.01). Release of creatine kinase muscle-brain isoenzyme was 41% less in the off-pump group (p<0.01). Off-pump patients were discharged 1 day earlier. At 1 month, operative mortality was zero in both groups, and quality of life had improved similarly. \\nIn chapter 7, a comparison of cardiac outcome and cost-effectiveness one year after off-pump and on-pump CABG is reported. One year survival free from stroke, myocardial infarction and coronary re-intervention was 88.0% after off-pump surgery and 90.6% after on-pump surgery (p=0.48). Survival free from angina was 89.3% vs 89.0% (p=0.93). Graft patency, determined in a randomized subset of patients, was 91% after off-pump and 93% after on-pump surgery (p=0.65). Off-pump surgery reduced costs by $2,329 (13.1%) per patient ($ 15,479 vs $ 17,808 p<0.01). Quality adjusted life years (0.82 vs 0.83; p=0.74) and event free survival years (1.02 vs 1.03; p=0.23) did not differ.\\nFinally, Chapter 8 comprises a general discussion of the Octopus Study. It is concluded that in selected patients, off-pump CABG is safe and yields a cardiac outcome that is comparable to that of on-pump CABG. Avoiding CPB is cost-effective and slightly decreases the need for blood transfusion, but other clinically relevant benefits of off-pump CABG are not established yet. Patients undergoing off-pump CABG have better cognitive outcome at 3 months after surgery, but the effect is of limited size.'],\n",

       "  'Description': [\"Some life-saving surgeries result in the necessity to establish permanent intestinal stomas; this outcome has an undeniable physical and emotional effect on the patient's life. Although patients with permanent stomas reasonably adjust, complications that include peristomal skin irritation, pouching system dysfunction, social inhibition, depression, and sexual dysfunction also have been reported. \\r\\nThe quest for intestinal stomal continence has resulted in numerous non-surgical and surgical continent diversion techniques. The use of dynamic myoplasty is one of them. Dynamic myoplasty is a term given to the use of electrical stimulation devices to stimulate surgically elevated muscle flaps. It has been used to treat fecal and urinary incontinence using a gracilis muscle flap neo-sphincter. Another clinical example is use of the lattissimus dorsi muscle to augment the pump function of the heart in patients with chronic heart failure. \\r\\nNone of the attempted techniques to maintain stomal continence have enjoyed widespread use because of associated complications or because these techniques were not able to provide complete continence. However, the use of dynamic myoplasty to achieve stomal continence has also met with limited success. Denervation atrophy caused by flap elevation to construct the sphincter and early muscle fatigue caused by continuous electrical stimulation were responsible for these disappointing results. \\r\\nIt was our goal to see if we could make an abdominal stoma continent using dynamic myoplasty. A multiphase project was undertaken that was designed to solve the critical issues of denervation atrophy and early muscle fatigue. To solve the problem of denervation atrophy an anatomic feasibility study was undertaken in fresh human cadavers. This first study was designed to determine which local muscle could serve as an innervated and well-perfused muscle flap. The rectus abdominis muscle (RAM) was found to be ideal. Of the two RAM stoma sphincter designs the island flap was found to be superior to the peninsula flap design. The next phase of the study was to identify an animal suitable for the development of a model for stoma sphincter design. In an acute canine study, it was determined that the RAM island flap sphincter design used in human cadavers could be applied to the dog. Using an electrical stimulation device, the muscle was able to be stimulated and to generate peak pressures well above 60 mm Hg (pressure needed to maintain fecal continence in humans). Muscle fatigue was found to be directly proportional to the stimulation frequency and continence was provided at all the tested bowel pressures (30, 65 and 100 mm Hg). These promising acute functional study results paved the way for the initiation of chronic trials incorporating survival operations in dogs. In the first chronic study, it was revealed that the sphincter design was fatigue-resistant for 4 hours up to three months post-op with one of the two training protocols tested. In addition, a second chronic study was undertaken to test whether direct nerve stimulation, as opposed to intramuscular stimulation, would render more favorable results. Although the numbers were too small there was a tendency that the sphincter could be trained faster with direct nerve stimulation. However, electrode failure (displacement and lead fracture) led to a non-functioning sphincter in 63% of the cases when using direct nerve stimulation.\"],\n",

       "  'Description': ['A surgeon faced with a patient presenting with an open tibial/fibular fracture in combination with severe damage of the surrounding soft tissues, has to make the difficult decision whether to attempt salvage or to perform an immediate amputation of the leg.\\n\\nUntil late in the nineteenth century the mortality from open fractures was high - mainly due to sepsis after infection. Theodor Billroth, the famous surgeon, reported in 1881 that 46 of 93 patients with an open fracture of the lower leg whom he treated in Zurich, died. Gunshot wounds were particularly notorious and though generally treated with immediate amputation, most of these victims did not survive. It is recorded that in the American Civil War (1861-1865), the overall mortality rate after nearly 30.000 amputations was in the order of 30%, for above-knee amputations it reached 54%. In the Franco-Prussian War (1870-1871), the death rate from open fractures was 41%, while for open fractures of the knee this rate was even 77%. With the growing understanding of bacterial contamination and cross infection, the introduction of antisepsis and aseptic surgery, the advances in operative fracture stabilisation and, more recently, the various options for bone and soft-tissue reconstruction, the problems from open fractures have been greatly reduced. The emphasis came from life saving via limb salvage on restoration of limb function and preservation of quality of life.\\n\\nAt the present time, the majority of open tibial fractures are caused by traffic accidents. In the Netherlands, approximately 5.000 patients annually are admitted to hospital with a lower leg fracture - both as an isolated injury and as part of \\x93polytrauma\\x94. It is estimated that open fractures account for 10% of this total. The improvements in treatment of mangled lower legs have opened the door to therapeutical options, previously unavailable to the surgeon. Nowadays, attempt at salvage is frequently chosen, because due to modern reconstructive techniques this is successful in the majority of cases. However, in some patients - for example due to persisting ischemia of the lower leg or to concomitant life-threatening injuries - it is obvious that immediate (primary) amputation is the option of choice.  Unfortunately, in some of these cases nevertheless salvage is attempted - mainly due to a combination of wrong clinical judgement and optimistically thinking of the surgeon.  Although these attempts seem successful eventually, after a long period of untreatable infections and other complications (secondary) amputation has to be performed as yet. These patients generally undergo more and more complex operations, and suffer more from complications than patients with a primary amputation. It is clear that it should be avoided that a patient will end up in such a situation. \\n\\nIn this thesis, we tried to clarify several aspects of this difficult clinical problem by answering the following questions:\\n1. Is it possible to predict outcome in individual patients with a mangled lower leg?\\n2. What are the short-term consequences of the chosen treatment?\\n3. How is the long-term outcome of successful salvage and amputation?\\n4.What are the influences of smoking on the healing of open tibial fractures?\\n5. How are the results of treatment of infected segmental defect pseudarthrosis of the tibia?'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The aim of this thesis is to provide a practical framework for dose escalation in the prostate using intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and to find out if marker based on-line position verification is clinically feasible and effective.\\r\\nWe present a class solution for dose escalation in the prostate in which the issue of dose escalation is dealt with separately from the choice of the margins and the nominal rectum dose. In our partial boost approach the dose escalation is mainly restricted to the prostate, while outside the prostate the dose distribution of our conventional conformal treatment is mimicked. Both the margin size and the maximum rectum dose can be chosen independently from the level of dose escalation. The framework for prostate dose escalation put forward in this thesis allows practical introduction of IMRT in routine clinical practice using current standards of GTV imaging and position verification.\\r\\nImplantation of gold markers in the prostate facilitates the visualization of the prostate during treatment. This allows verification and correction of the prostate position according to the position of the prostate during CT scanning for treatment planning. This procedure removes both random and systematic errors due patient setup and organ motion. To perform such position verification in an automated way several requirements should be met.  The size of the markers should not be too small, since the markers should still be discernible from the noise. They should also not be too large, as large markers are more invasive and generate a higher risk of toxicity. For acquisition of portal images that are used for verification a very low amount of exposure should be used (1-2 monitor units). The time needed for detecting the markers within the portal images should be very short. The detection process should be accurate and should have a high success rate. Marker migration and prostate volume alteration during treatment will deteriorate the accuracy of the verification process, so both effects should be small. Finally no major toxicity following the implantation of small markers should be present.\\r\\nThe research presented in this thesis proves that all requirements can be met. Thanks to the use of an a-Si flat-panel imager and a dedicated software algorithm markers of 1 mm diameter and 5 mm length can detected automatically (success rate > 90 %), fast (within 1 s) and accurate (better than 0.3 mm). Marker migration appears to be present, but remains very small (standard deviation 0.5 mm). The effect of prostate volume alteration during treatment appears to be smaller than the inaccuracy that is present due to volume delineation. For 10 patients that were treated in a feasibility study no major toxicity related to marker implantation was noticed. In a group of 23 patients off-line marker based position verification was proved to reduce the standard deviations of the systematic error to below 1 mm. Intratreatment prostate motions could be visualized as well and appeared to be very small on average (standard deviation < 1 mm).\\r\\nWe conclude that marker based position verification provides a reliable method for decreasing the geometrical deviations during prostate irradiation. On-line marker based position verification will even entirely remove prostate position variability during treatment.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Periodic fever and mevalonate kinase deficiency'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Mevalonate kinase (MK) deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder, caused by mutations in the MVK-gene on chromosome 12q24. The affected enzyme catalyzes an early step in isoprenoid biosynthesis, the pathway that produces cholesterol and several non-sterol isoprenoids. The clinical spectrum includes hyper IgD and periodic fever syndrome (HIDS) and mevalonic aciduria. Both phenotypes are characterized by recurrent generalized inflammation and fever attacks from infancy,. accompanied by malaise, headache, diarrhea, abdominal pain, vomiting, skin rashes, arthralgias, arthritis, tender lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and oral and genital ulcers. In addition, the mevalonic aciduria phenotype is characterized by mental retardation and facial malformation. The severe phenotype reflects a more profound enzyme deficiency due to distinct mutations in the MVK gene. Urinary excretion of the accumulating substrate of MK, mevalonic acid is about a thousand fold higher in MA than in HIDS. By definition, serum IgD is elevated in HIDS. However, 20% of clinically diagnosed HIDS patients have normal MK activity and IgD may be normal in MK deficiency.\\r\\nEx vivo, mononuclear cells from MK deficiency patients secrete more IL-1beta. We could demonstrate that this was due to decreased generation of isoprenoid products and not to accumulation of the substrate of MK, mevalonate, linking the metabolic defect directly to inflammation. The enzyme activity in HIDS proved to be discontinuous, dropping with increasing temperature, both in vitro and in vivo. This finding provides a possible explanation for he episodic nature of inflammation in HIDS. Despite the raised serum IgD, the affected leukocyte populations were not lymphocytes, but phagocytes, as judged by the surface expression of cellular activation markers. .This was further supported by the increased urinary excretion of leukotriene E4, a product of activated monocytes and macrophages, during febrile crises. \\r\\nIn summary, distinct mutations in MVK, lead to varying degrees of MK deficiency. This is reflected in a variable phenotype of episodic generalized inflammation with (MA) or without (HIDS) neurological and facial abnormalities. Due to the shortage of an as yet unidentified isoprenoid product, activated mononuclear phagocytes secrete more IL-1beta, a potent primary pro-inflammatory cytokine, giving rise to realized inflammation. Thisinflammation is episodic due to the increased temperature sensitivity of mutant MK.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Recombinant coagulation factor VIIa (rFVIIa) has recently become available for treatment of patients with\\ninhibitor-complicated haemophilia. It has been postulated that rFVIIa could become a universal haemostatic\\nagent. Case reports and small studies confirm efficacy and safety of rFVIIa in a variety of haemostatic disorders\\nincluding liver disease, platelet-related bleeding disorders, and in patients without prior coagulopathy who are\\nbleeding excessively due to trauma or surgery.\\nAlthough clinical evidence for efficacy and safety of rFVIIa in its various applications is rapidly accumulating,\\nvery little is know about the molecular mechanisms by which rFVIIa induces haemostasis.\\nIn this thesis, novel hypotheses on the mechanism of action of rFVIIa in different haemostatic disorders are\\ndescribed. In the major part of this thesis, the focus is on the involvement of thrombin activatable fibrinolysis\\ninhibitor (TAFI)-mediated down-regulation of fibrinolysis in in vitro systems representing various haemostatic\\ndisorders, and the effect of rFVIIa.\\nIn chapter 2, it has been described that rFVIIa, next to its procoagulant properties, possesses antifibrinolyic\\nproperties in plasma from patients with severe haemophilia A. This antifibrinolytic effect was due to enhanced\\nactivation of TAFI.\\nChapter 3 describes the complex haemostatic disorder induced by liver disease, and in chapter 4 the role of\\nTAFI-mediated downregulation of fibrinolysis in liver disease was investigated. In contrast to earlier reports, we\\ndid not find evidence of hyperfibrinolysis in liver disease, and also TAFI activation appeared normal, despite\\ndecreased plasma levels of TAFI antigen. In chapter 5, the effect of rFVIIa on coagulation and fibrinolysis in\\nplasma from patients with liver disease are described. In contrast to the situation in haemophilia, rFVIIa did not\\ndisplay an antifibrinolytic effect in plasma from patients with liver disease. In contrast to the haemophilia\\nsituation, TAFI activation is already optimal in plasma from these patients.\\nIn chapter 6, the effect of anticoagulants targeting different steps in the coagulation cascade on coagulation and\\nfibrinolysis were examined. It was found that anticoagulant drugs targeting factor Xa, but not those inhibiting\\nthrombin or tissue factor accelerated fibrinolysis in vitro. In chapter 6, the effects of rFVIIa on coagulation and\\nfibrinolysis of plasma anticoagulated with fondaparinux (a novel anticoagulant, specifically directed against\\nfactor Xa) were investigated. rFVIIa was able to completely reverse the effects of fondaparinux on coagulation,\\nand was partially able to reverse the induction of hyperfibrinolysis by the drug.\\nIn chapter 8, the focus was on the effects of rFVIIa on platelet adhesion under flow conditions. More\\nspecifically, a model for the mechanism of action of rFVIIa in patients with Glanzmann\\x92s thrombasthenia, and\\npatients treated with anti-aIIbB3 drugs is proposed based on results of in vitro perfusion studies. It was shown that\\ntissue factor-indepdent thrombin generation via rFVIIa restored the defective platelet deposition induced by\\naIIbB3-deficiency.\\nIn chapter 9, the results presented in the previous chapters are discussed in a broader context. The advances in\\nthe understanding of the mechanism of action of rFVIIa in its different applications are discussed.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The central question in this thesis is whether microvascular endothelial cells (MVEC) from subcutaneous fat tissue are suitable for the seeding of prosthetic vascular grafts and deendothelialized surfaces. The aim of the application of endothelial cells (EC) is the inhibition of thrombogenicity and intimal hyperplasia.\\r\\n* Seeding of MVEC from fat tissue onto prosthetic vascular grafts results in a confluent EC layer on top of a multiplayer of (myo)fibroblasts. Contaminating cells from the transplant contribute to this intimal hyperplasia. \\r\\n* The seeding of blood vessels after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) with MVEC from fat tissue results in an increased intimal hyperplasia of the vessel wall. Again contaminants from the transplant seem to contribute to this intimal hyperplasia. \\r\\n* Cells isolated from fat tissue consist of 40% EC, and 60% contaminating cells ((myo)fibroblasts and macrophages). A combination of magnetic spheres coated with cell-specific antibodies can be used to remove the contaminants. The purity is increased from 40 to more than 90%. \\r\\n* Laboratory experiments show that thrombogenicity and intimal hyperplasia decrease significantly after seeding of purified cells compared to nonpurified ones.\\r\\n* In a laboratory model blood vessels were purfused continuously with cell culture medium. \\r\\nThe seeding of purified cells resulted in a reduced intimal hyperplasia compared to the seeding of nonpurified cells.\\r\\n* One of the two antibodies necessary to remove contaminating cells is not suitable for clinical application. The CD34-selection method from Nexell selects the EC instead of the contaminating cells. The necessary products are approved for clinical grade application. The purity obtained is the same, however the yield is lower.  \\r\\n* Definitive evidence for the suitability of purified MVEC cell seeding purposes is a clinical study. The ideal scenario is to utilize a graft for which thrombus formation and intimal hyperplasia are frequently events. In addition, the risk to the patient in case the procedure fails must be as low as possible. For this reason, we chose prosthetic arteriovenous (AV) grafts instead of lower extremity bypass grafts, for which the cell seeding procedure was originally developed. In ten patients, an AV graft will be implanted that is seeded with purified autologous fat derived MVEC. This is the ECLIPSE-studie (endothelial cell lining on prosthetic shunts evaluation). In case the pilot-study shows that the seeding of purified MVEC from fat tissue is safe, feasible, and effective, a randomised study will be performed.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The heterogeneous nature of the basal cerebral arteries is well illustrated by the differences in the extent of innervation as found in different species as well as the variation in the degree of innervation during ageing and disease. To explain these differences, we postulated a coupling between variation in metabolic demand and corresponding flow fluctuations in the afferent arteries leading to adaptation of the nerve fibers in these arteries. This hypothesis was tested by inducing an experimental olfactory deficit or anosmia through intranasal application of zinc sulfate. It was shown that anosmia leads to a decrease in cholinergic- and nitrergic nerve fibers in the anterior cerebral artery, which coincides with a decreased metabolic activity in the olfactory bulb. Also, flow measurements revealed no changes in flow in the olfactory bulb after presenting a mixture of odorants into the nasal cavity in the anosmic rat. These facts support the above-mentioned postulation. The question remains how signaling from flow changes to the vessel wall and as a consequence alterations in nerve fiber densities take place. We propose a role for the parasympathetic neurotrophic factor neurturin in adaptation of the cholinergic- and nitrergic nerve fiber density in the anterior cerebral artery in the anosmic rat. Neurturin was infused during 14 days into the lateral ventricles, by using osmotic minipumps. Subsequently, immunohistochemical techniques were used to localize the parasympathetic nerves containing vesicular acetylcholine transporter and nitric oxide synthase in the basal cerebral arteries and the nerve fiber densities were quantified by image analysis. This analysis showed that neurturin infusion is able to prevent the decrease of nitrergic nerve fibers but not cholinergic nerve fibers in the anosmic rat. It is speculated that cholinergic fibers are supported by a different growth factor. It may be summarized that according to the results presented in the thesis, the following factors may cohere in determining local patterns of nerve fiber densities in the cerebral arteries: (1) metabolic demand, (2) flow changes, (3) availability of neurotrophic factors.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Whooping cough or pertussis is a highly contagious disease of the respiratory tract, caused by Bordetella pertussis. In The Netherlands mass vaccination against B. pertussis was introduced in 1953 and was very effective in reducing the pertussis incidence and mortality. Although vaccination was initially very effective, the pertussis incidence increased remarkably after 1996 in The Netherlands. Epidemics have been reported in 1996, 1999 and 2001, while in the intermittent years the incidence did not return to levels observed previous to 1996. The goal of this thesis was to find an explanation for the re-emergence of B. pertussis in countries with highly vaccinated populations, in particular The Netherlands.\\nThe re-emergence of pertussis might be explained by changes in surveillance and diagnostic criteria, changes in vaccine quality or a decrease in vaccine coverage. However, for The Netherlands these possibilities have been excluded. Waning vaccine-induced immunity and strain adaptations are other possible explanations. Indeed, we observed that the introduction of vaccination affected the B. pertussis population significantly. Notable changes were observed in the population structure of Dutch B. pertussis strains in 2 periods: the 1960s, a decade after the introduction of vaccination and in the 1990s, the period, when pertussis re-emerged in The Netherlands. IS1002-based fingerprint typing showed a change in fingerprint types a decade after the introduction of vaccination. Fingerprint types from the prevaccination period disappeared, while novel fingerprint types emerged. \\nWe hypothesized that antigenic divergence between vaccine strains and circulating strains may be the underlying cause of the changes observed with IS1002 fingerprint typing. To address this hypothesis, we studied polymorphism in genes coding for surface proteins. In the 1960s the only mismatch we detected between the vaccine strains and circulating strains was with respect to pertussis toxin subunit 1 (PtxS1). Although we observed divergence between vaccine strains and clinical isolates, suggesting that vaccination selected for strains that were less affected by vaccine-induced immunity, vaccination remained very effective, since mortality decreased 114-fold in the late 1960s compared to the prevaccination period.\\nThe second period showing changes in the population structure was observed in the 1990s. In this period we observed divergence between vaccine strains and clinical isolates in the surface associated proteins pertactin (Prn) and tracheal colonization factor (TcfA). Polymorphism was not restricted to genes coding for surface proteins, but was also observed in regulatory genes, such as the promoter region for pertussis toxin, ptxP. The alleles of Prn, TcfA and ptxP, found in the vaccine strains, were replaced by novel variants in the 1990s. Further, animal studies indicate that vaccination has shifted the competitive balance between strains, resulting in expansion of strains that are less affected by vaccine-induced immunity.\\nThe data presented in this thesis provide an explanation for the re-emergence of pertussis and a better understanding of how pathogens evolve after the introduction of vaccines.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Little is known about the nature of genetic variation underlying complex diseases in humans. The recognition that susceptibility to type 2 diabetes mellitus has a strong inherited component provides a mechanism for developing the molecular understanding of the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus through various genetic approaches. The main aim of the Breda study described in this thesis was to identify genetic factors involved in type 2 diabetes mellitus in a defined Dutch population. This thesis gives gives an overview of the approaches that can be used to identify genetic factors in type 2 diabetes mellitus and, in particular, the role of candidate gene analysis and genome-wide scanning is emphasised. \\n\\nThis thesis also describes the results of a genome-wide scan performed for type 2 diabetes mellitus in a defined Dutch population. The genome-wide scan was carried out using identity-by-descent analysis in affected sibpairs. Since obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus are inter-related, the data set was stratified for the sub-phenotype body mass index (BMI), corrected for age and gender. This resulted in a suggestive maximum multi-point LOD score of 2.3 (p-value 9.7 x 10-4] for the most obese 20% pedigrees of the data set in the region flanked by marker loci D18S471 and D18S843 (chromosome region 18p11). We hereby confirmed the presence of a susceptibility locus on chromosome 18, reported earlier from a Finnish/Swedish population. This finding provided solid and independent evidence that the chromosome 18p11 locus is of definite interest for type 2 diabetes mellitus in connection with obesity in the Breda study cohort. In addition, we demonstrated that in the lowest 80% obese pedigrees (\"lean\" type 2 diabetes mellitus) two interesting loci on chromosomes 2 and 19 were found with LODs of 1.5 and 1.3, respectively (p-values 7.5 x 10-3 and 11.2 x 10-3]. \\nFurther more this thesis describes the analysis for linkage to loci influencing BMI (using quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping) in 420 type 2 diabetes mellitus patients from the Breda cohort for which BMI values where available. Subsequently, the genotype data from the 20% most obese type 2 diabetes mellitus pedigrees (\"obese\" type 2 diabetes mellitus) was also analysed for linkage to type 2 diabetes mellitus using the ASP analysis. The QTL results support previous findings of a susceptibility locus (QTL) influencing BMI in type 2 diabetes mellitus residing on chromosome region 11q. In addition, suggestive evidence was found and previous findings confirmed for linkage with type 2 diabetes mellitus on chromosome regions 1q, 11p, and 12q. In general, it appears that the linkage found for type 2 diabetes mellitus in the present cohort is strongly influenced by obesity. This supports the notion that a genetic predisposition to obesity is closely intertwined with one predisposition to type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, our study fails to determine to what extent obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus are genetically unique entities in their own right. \\nComplementary to these approaches described above also candidate gene association studies were performed with the sulphonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) gene and type 2 diabetes mellitus, and with the beta-adrenergic receptor-2 (B2ADR) gene and obesity in type 2 diabetes mellitus subjects from the Breda study cohort. In our cohort, no significant association was found with the SNP16 variant of the SUR1 gene in type 2 diabetes patients compared to controls. The genotypes of SNP27 variant in the B2ADR gene were matched to the BMI values of 542 patients in our cohort and were compared using ANOVA with age and gender as covariates. No statistically significant difference was observed between the various groups, implying that, in our cohort, this polymorphism has no important effect on body mass index. Also no effect was found for this polymorphism on either the age of diagnosis of diabetes or on plasma lipids levels. \\nThe results of this thesis will, together with previously reported results, help accelerate the efforts to identify susceptibility genes for type 2 diabetes mellitus located in the regions described above. Combined with new developments in the fields of bioinformatics, genomics and proteomics, this will lead to a greater understanding of the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Identifying new pathways involved in the disease aetiology may help identify new therapeutic goals, and direct efforts to target therapies to relevant tissues. By improving the classification of type 2 diabetes, together with new insights in pharmacogenetics, this genetic information may form the basis for the development of new drug therapies and hopefully, in the future, will lead to the prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Hyperthermia is an adjuvant treatment modality to radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy, with the aim of increasing the tumour killing effect of the treatment. It involves the elevation of the tumour temperature to ~ 42oC. Radiofrequent heating is a practical method for hyperthermia: a number of externally positioned antennas radiate waves that penetrate the body and cause a local temperature increase. Frequencies from 70 MHz to 110 MHz are used for regional hyperthermia, that is applied to tumours in the pelvic region, like cervical, bladder, prostate and rectal tumours. During hyperthermia a number of treatment limiting effects occur, like local pain and general discomfort, that limit the total applied power. Due to this limitation the required tumour temperature can not be obtained. The recent advent of numerical models for simulation of electromagnetic waves in heterogeneous patient models and calculation of the temperature distribution in perfused tissues, enables accurate hyperthermia treatment planning. This thesis addresses the use of electromagnetic and thermal models for the improvement of hyperthermia applicators and treatment techniques.The use of absorbing blocks for the local reduction of hot spots is described. Rectangular absorbing blocks, consisting of agar boundsaline water, create a local attenuation of absorption maxima, but also cause a negative edge effect. This can be reduced by tapering of the edges, introduction of a waterlayer and by variation of the salinity of the block along its length. Regional hyperthermia treatment can be significantly improved by application of an annular, multi-ring, multi-antenna array, operating at 150 MHz. In this array applicator the power distribution can be controlled by phase-amplitude steering. Comparison with existing radiative and capacitive hyperthermia applicators shows that local pain can be reduced by phase-amplitude control and that a better temperature distribution in the tumour can be obtained.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Over the years there has been steadfast increase in the quantity of patients with a prenatally detected structural congenital heart disease. Despite efforts to achieve the contrary, some of these pregnancies will end in intra-uterine death. In these patients the sole advantage of the prenatal diagnosis is the facilitation of thorough parental counseling concerning future pregnancies; additionally it might help parents better to cope with the loss of their child. \\nThe primary goal of prenatal detection of cardiac defects, however, is the enabling of better care in the immediate postnatal period and the most convincing justification for the efforts taken, would be to demonstrate that prenatally diagnosed patients have a better chance on a good outcome as a result of early initiation of therapy. \\nThis thesis shows that prenatal diagnosis of heart disease, both morphological and functional, may influence management of pregnancy and outcome for affected fetuses. It is the most important positive effect of prenatal diagnosis that the sequence of planned delivery in a center, equipped to treat this type of patients, and the immediate installment of appropriate therapy can lead to an improved long-term outcome. Lactate levels reflecting the overall oxygen deficiency experienced seem to be a good indicator to measure this possible positive effect. Planned delivery and immediate therapy may keep lactate levels of affected fetuses below 6.1 mmol/l, providing a safe starting point for surgical intervention with better chances of a normal neurophysiological development.\\nThe two extreme sides of the spectrum of prenatally encountered congenital heart disease described in this thesis, the hypoplastic left heart syndrome and Ebstein\\x92s malformation, indicate that in these cases morphology dominates outcome in a negative manner. This implies that even the best managed pregnancies, deliveries and immediate care of these patients do not assure a favourable long-term outcome.\\nFinally data concerning the well-controlled diabetic pregnancies show that this maternal disease infringes on both the fetal cardiac anatomy and circulation. The higher incidence of congenital heart disease is predominantly located in the cono-truncal region. The circulatory changes encountered in the structurally normal heart occur later in gestation and suggest to be adaptive to ensure an increased cardiac output.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['There is a growing interest in the physical training possibilities of children with juvenile arthritis. In the first Chapter a brief introduction on physical fitness and physical training is given including an overview of the existing studies in juvenile arthritis patients. In Chapter 2, we described the findings of our pilot study with 10 JIA patients. We developed our aquatic fitness training program using the experiences of this pilot study. During this pilot study found a high willingness of parents and JIA patients to participate in a training study. Chapter 3 deals with the reliability of the assessment of the maximum oxygen uptake (VO2peak; the gold standard for physical fitness) and gives a description of our experiences of exercise testing in this patient group. We found an impaired VO2peak especially in the more severe diseased patents. The comparison of the exercise capacity of JIA patients with healthy peers is systematically reviewed in Chapter 4. A meta-analysis showed that the VO2peak of JIA patients was 21.8 % lower (95 % confidence interval: 13.7 %, 29.9 %) compared to healthy controls (p < 0.0001). \\r\\nThe relationship between functional ability and different indices of both aerobic and anaerobic physical fitness is described in Chapter 5. A low relationship between aerobic fitness and functional ability was found (r = 0.0 to 0.4, p > 0.05, except for eating r = 0.46, p<0.05). The correlations between anaerobic physical fitness and functional ability in JIA patients were strong (r = 0.5 to 0.75, p<0.05). This is indicated a good relationship between anaerobic fitness and functional ability.\\r\\nThe association between physical activity and physical fitness are described in Chapter 6. Partial correlation coefficients (to control for age) between physical activity and indices of health related physical fitness showed significant relationships between CaltracTM motion counts and absolute VO2peak (r=0.31) and relative VO2peak (r=0.34), but not with the indices of body composition. There was also a significant correlation between PAL and relative VO2peak (r=0.33). Physical activity was significantly related to cardio-respiratory fitness but not with body composition in children with JIA. \\r\\nThe effects of our physical training study provided in Chapter 7. Fifty-four patients with JIA (age 5 to13 years) participated in this study and were randomised into an experimental (N = 27) and a control (N = 27) group. The children in the experimental group received a training program consisting of a 1 hour a week supervised training program in a local pool of approximately 20 sessions. Effects were analysed on the following domains: functional ability, health-related quality of life, Joint status and physical fitness. Although all measures improved more in the experimental group compared to the control group, none of the differences became statistically significant. The current research found no significant effect of an aquatic fitness-training program in children with JIA. Since there were no signs for worsening in health status, one can conclude that this was a safe exercise program.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['B2-glycoprotein I : Its role in the antiphospholipid syndrome'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['The association between the development of thrombosis in patients and the persistent presence of antiphospholipid antibodies in their plasma is called the antiphospholipid syndrome. These antiphospholipid antibodies are not directed against phospholipids directly, but against phospholipid-bound proteins. One of the most important proteins against which these antibodies are directed is B2-glycoproteine I (B2GPI). The antibodies can form a complex with B2GPI by two mechanisms: (1) one antibody binds one molecule of B2GPI, resulting in a conformational change in B2GPI and (2) one antibody binds two molecules of B2GPI, resulting in the formation of a bivalent complex. Both mechanisms result in an enormously increased affinity of B2GPI for negatively charged phospholipids. This is used for the detection of these antibodies: by the enormous increase in affinity for negatively charged phospholipids, the B2GPI-antibody complex competes with clotting factors to bind to these phospholipids in a coagulation assay. Therefore, the phospholipids, needed for coagulation, are not available. This results in a prolongation of the clotting time, which is named lupus anticoagulant (LAC) activity. \\r\\nIn this study, fusion proteins between B2GPI and the dimerisation domain of factor XI were made. This dimeric B2GPI, which mimics the formation of a bivalent complex, binds with an enormously increased affinity to negatively charged phospholipids and possesses LAC activity. Thus, the contructs made mimic the in vitro effects of B2GPI-antibody complexes.\\r\\nThe association between the thrombosis in patients and the LAC activity in vitro is paradoxal. Therefore, the effects of dimeric B2GPI on platelet adhesion in an in vitro thrombosis model were investigated. In this model, blood flows with a defined over a thrombogenic surface (e.g. collagen), resulting in the adhesion of platelets to the surface. This surface coverage is analysed afterwards. In this study, the flow rate of the blood resembles the flow rate in arteries. With this model, it was shown that in the presence of dimeric B2GPI or anti-B2GPI  antibodies platelet deposition increased. Furthermore, it was shown that the increased adhesion disappeared in the presence of inhibitors of thromboxane formation. The increased platelet adhesion, observed in the presence of anti-B2GPI antibodies, was not affected when the Fc-receptor on platelets was blocked. An anti-B2GPI antibody, that did not increase platelet deposition, inhibited the increase in platelet adhesion observed in the presence of dimeric B2GPI, suggesting a role for a receptor specific for B2GPI.\\r\\nTaken these observations together, a model by which anti-B2GPI antibodies can cause arterial thrombosis was postulated. The B2GPI-antibody complex binds to negatively charged phospholipids exposed on the platelet surface. The exposition of these phospholipids is a result of the activation of the platelets by for example collagen. This is followed by the binding of the B2GPI-antibody complex to a receptor specific for B2GPI, which results in the activation of this receptor. Then, further activation of the platelets takes place, in which the formation of thromboxane is involved. Finally, this leads to sensitisation of the platelets, which are thereby more prone to form a thrombus. The described findings may lead to the development of new diagnostic tests and therapeutics in the future.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['This report describes an eighteen-month action research project in an assessment, treatment and rehabilitation ward for older people in a large metropolitan hospital in New Zealand.  The study aimed at developing participative care and the clinical nurse consultant role, and advancing nursing practice.  Initially, nurses and patients worked together towards establishing a relationship in which patients were viewed as valid members of the interdisciplinary team.  In the reconnaissance phase, nursing practice was critically examined.  One-to-one guided interviews with nurses, patients and their families, and group discussions were used to develop an understanding of current nursing practice.  This led to the transformative action in which action plans, based on the feedback from patients, nurses and allied health workers, were implemented and reflected upon.  The action plans consisted of environmental changes, alteration of the admission procedure, implementation of group (patient) education sessions, and patient guided care plans.  The positive outcome of this phase was the impetus for the interdisciplinary phase, in which patients became active participants in interdisciplinary participative goal-setting meetings.  Interdisciplinary assessment forms and care plans were also piloted at this stage.  The qualitative evaluation suggests that patient participation in the planning and evaluation of care came to be regarded as valuable by patients and health professionals.  In conclusion, by critically examining nursing practice, the nurses were able to gain an insight into their practice, take informed action to transform practice, and initiate change in a ward environment.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Many (pre-)school children with acute or chronic respiratory problems are seen every day by  physicians, both in primary care and in hospitals. Although in many children these respiratory symptoms are self-limiting, it is important to recognise early in the course of the disease those children that are at risk to suffer from persistent respiratory diseases and to develop pulmonary function abnormalities and chronic airway remodelling. \\r\\nIn most children diagnosis and treatment of respiratory disease are mainly based on medical history and physical examination. However, the evaluation of objective disease markers, e.g. pulmonary function could be helpful for the assessment of functional abnormalities. Especially in pre-school children respiratory function parameters are rarely available. \\r\\nAlthough recently several alternative methods have been developed, most have and can not be implemented for use in daily clinical practice and are currently only available in specialised centres. Many of these tests require difficult technical procedures, anaesthetic care or are even invasive.\\r\\nClinical application of new or alternative pulmonary function tests in young children is only possible for techniques that are easily performed in children of all ages, do not require much time or sedation and show results quickly. They should be reproducible, cheap, able to distinguish healthy from diseased children, not invasive, applicable during spontaneous breathing, responsive to intervention and useful for follow up. Promising techniques that might fulfil (most of these) requirements are tidal breathing analysis, interrupter resistance measurement and impulse oscillometry. \\r\\nAdaptation of traditional techniques (MEFV) or standardisation of these newer techniques and availability of reference values might enable more widespread use of these techniques in daily practice. The studies described in this thesis addressed several aspects of pulmonary function testing in pre-school and school children.'],\n",

Eosinophils normally constitute only a few percent of circulating leukocytes. Increased numbers of eosinophils are found in peripheral blood, tissues, and bronchoalveolar lavage of allergic asthma patients. In the bone marrow multipotent stem cells can differentiate towards mature eosinophils, which is associated with the expression of specifi c genes, coding for e.g. the granule proteins. A highly organised network is required to coordinate these events and to maintain steady state levels of mature cells, as well as to stimulate the rapid production of specifi c cell types when needed.

       "  'Description': ['Cardiovascular disease is the major cause of death in westernized societies, responsible for 35.5% of the total mortality in The Netherlands. Part of the current  decline in cardiovascular mortality has been attributed to primary prevention in adults. However, as the roots of cardiovascular disease are in early life, the possibilities for prevention in childhood may be considered.\\nTo study early cardiovascular determinants and possible prevention stategies the Atherosclerosis Risk in Young Adults (ARYA) study was designed, consisting of more than 1000 young adults of around 30 years of age selected from the general population. Routine data at birth, childhood and adolescence of 750 subjects was collected from school health records. Of 262 subjects biannual and standardized measurements of cardiovascular risk factors during adolescence were collected by the Municipal Health Service. Recently, cardiovascular risk factors and vascular damage were remeasured.\\nOne of the possible early cardiovascular determinants is low birth weight, a concept known as the \"fetal origins hypothesis\" . Our data show that homozygous carriers of a functional polymorphism in the promoter region of the IGF-I gene show a increased cardiovascular risk factor levels at young age but not with birth weight. Furthermore, we found that the first born children of non-carrier parents weighed on average 584 gram less than homozygous parents, indicating that the IGF-I gene may be related to the fetal growth of their newborns. Our further analyses support the fetal origins hypothesis, as an average decrease in birth weight (540 gram) was associated with one excess coronary heart disease event in 1000 subjects. Also, low birth weight was associated with increased blood pressure, but restricted to those with high attained relative body weights. Next, we observed similar to others that an unfavorable intra-uterine environment may be less important for future hypertension than an excess gain in body weight in later life. \\nPostmortem studies showed that the subclinical process of atherosclerosis was more pronounced in the young with increased risk factor levels. Our findings in healthy young subjects strengthen these findings by showing that systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure at adolescence were positively associated with arterial thickening, a marker for generalized atherosclerosis. The results were independent of blood pressure, gender, age and body mass index.\\nWe confirm the finding that adolescent blood pressure in boys and girls predicts hypertension 15 years later. Measuring the blood pressure once, multiple times, routinely or standardized did not affect this prediction. In addition to others, a single routine blood pressure measurement in young adolescent girls could distinguish 60% of the hypertensive women at young adulthood. In young adolescent boys, blood pressure did not distinguish young adults with and without hypertension, but an elevated blood pressure predicted 10-year cardiovascular risk in young adulthood as estimated by the cardiovascular risk profile.\\nWe conclude that there is evidence to support the fetal origins hypothesis. A relative low birth weight was associated with an increased blood pressure in young adults with a high body mass, and with an increased risk of a coronary heart disease event. However, a low birth weight was associated with a polymorphism in the promotor region of the IGF-I gene of one of the parents, suggesting that genes may underly the hypothesis. Also, a postnatal change of body size and attained body mass index at young adulthood seems to have a bigger impact on future cardiovascular risk, than birth weight. In addition, in girls a high adolescent blood pressure is able to distinguish those with and without future hypertension. This implies that the Municipal Health Service may consider to re-introduce the blood pressure screening at adolescence, to assess future cardiovascular risk.'],\n",

Two subgroups can be distinguished: patients in whom motor\\r\\nneurons (lower motor neuron disease (LMND)) or motor axons and their surrounding\\r\\nmyelin (multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN)) are affected, both leading to\\r\\nmuscle atrophy and weakness. As MMN is a potentially treatable disorder, its differentiation\\r\\nfrom LMND is important. Evidence of motor conduction block on nerve\\r\\nconduction studies and a positive response to treatment with intravenous\\r\\nimmunoglobulins (IVIg) are considered the most relevant criteria for the diagnosis\\r\\nof MMN.

Also little is known about\\r\\nthe natural course and treatment of lower motor neuron syndromes.\\r\\nAims\\r\\nThe aims of this study were (1) to improve the classi.cation of patients with lower\\r\\nmotor neuron syndromes using newest diagnostic methods, (2) to determine the\\r\\nnatural course of these syndromes, and (3) to study treatment forms in MMN.\\r\\nMethods\\r\\nPatients were examined clinically at a regular basis, which consisted of the assessment\\r\\nof muscle atrophy and weakness, respiratory function and functional impairment.\\r\\nAll patients underwent an extensive, standardized electrophysiological\\r\\nexamination at least once.\\r\\nResults\\r\\nBased on the pattern of weakness in 49 patients with LMND, we identi.ed four\\r\\nsubgroups. Except for one group with generalized weakness and respiratory insuf.-\\r\\nciency, leading to death in one third of patients, the disease course in patients with\\r\\nIX\\r\\nLMND was slow, with minimal progression of muscle weakness and functional\\r\\nimpairment over years. Also in patients with MMN we found evidence for a slowly\\r\\nprogressive disease course.\\r\\nWe propose a set of clinical, laboratory and electrophysiological criteria for the diagnosis\\r\\nof MMN, which has been verifed by follow-up and response to IVIg treatment\\r\\nin 37 patients with a lower motor neuron syndrome. Additionally, we studied\\r\\nthe distribution of electrophysiological abnormalities in MMN, its correlation with\\r\\nweakness and the development of an optimal electrodiagnostic protocol for MMN.\\r\\nThe results of a follow-up study on the efficacy of long-term (4-8 years) maintenance\\r\\ntherapy in 11 patients with MMN, showed that IVIg maintenance treatment\\r\\nhas a bene.cial long-term effect on muscle strength and upper limb disability, and\\r\\nthus seems rational, but may not prevent a slight decrease in muscle strength.\\r\\nElectrophysiologically, both improvement and worsening were found. In an open\\r\\npilot-study with interferon-b1a (IFN-b1a, 3x/wk for 6 months) in nine patients\\r\\nwith MMN, three patients showed an improvement on IFN-b1a which was more\\r\\npronounced than on IVIg and which sustained itself for months after discontinuation\\r\\nof IFN-b1a. A controlled study is necessary to further investigate the effect of\\r\\nIFN-b1a treatment in patients with MMN.\\r\\nConclusions\\r\\nUntil we have identi.ed these possible underlying pathophysiological mechanisms it\\r\\nwill prove difficult to consider the various lower motor neuron syndromes as separate\\r\\ndiseases.

(HAPCs) were identified. In IBS the descending colon had a decreased overall frequency of phasic contractions and motility index as compared to the sigmoid colon, whereas healthy controls did not show regional differences. In IBS the number of high amplitude propagated contractions (HAPCs) was increased and propagated more distally than did HAPCs in controls. Clustered HAPCs were more frequently observed in IBS and these were found to be related to bowel movements. \\r\\nChapter 3: evaluates the effect of the 5-HT3-antagonist alosetron on left colonic motility and stool characteristics in non-constipated IBS patients and controls. Using a double-blind, randomized, crossover design and an ambulant manometry technique, motility was studied on day 7 of treatment. Alosetron increased contractile frequency in the sigmoid colon and the amplitude of contractions in the descending colon, increased the number of HAPCs in IBS and prolonged the distance of HAPC propagation. Paradoxically, stool frequency was decreased and stools became firmer during alosetron treatment.\\r\\nIn Chapter 4 abdominal pain and HAPCs, here called high-amplitude propagated pressure waves (HAPPWs), were recorded in IBS  and controls. The aim of this study was to quantify the association between pain episodes and HAPPWs, assessed by a modification of the symptom association probability (SAP). Four of the 7 IBS patients had SAP scores > 95%,  meaning the association between HAPPWs and pain occurred by chance was less than 5%. A correlation was found between duration of  pain and number of HAPPWs related. An association between HAPPWs and pain, recorded under physiological conditions, can be demonstrated and quantified in IBS patients. \\r\\nChapter 5 evaluates colorectal periprandial tone and phasic motility in patients with asymptomatic (ADD) and symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease (SUDD) and controls. Rectal tone was not different between groups. In the sigmoid a trend towards a decreased volume was found in SUDD as compared to ADD. Phasic motility was increased in ADD as compared to controls and SUDD. A negative correlation between sigmoid barostat volume and phasic motility was found in SUDD only. Differences in tonic and phasic motility in the sigmoid colon indicate that not only symptoms but also motility might be a discriminating factor in SUDD and ADD.  \\r\\nIn Chapter 6 perception and compliance of the colorectal wall in ADD, SUDD and healthy controls was studied, using a dual barostat device and stepwise intermittent isobaric distensions. SUDD showed increased perception scores in the rectum as compared to controls and ADD. Increased perception in SUDD was also found in the sigmoid colon as compared to controls. No differences in perception score was found between ADD and controls. In the rectum and sigmoid compliance was comparable for all three groups. It is concluded that hyperperception can be found in SUDD but not in ADD which can not be explained by a change in wall compliance.'],\n",

The MC4-R subtype is the only one present in the spinal cord, located in nociception-associated areas (laminae II and X), which prompted us to investigate its role in neuropathic pain. Therefore we used the rat chronic constriction injury (CCI) model for neuropathic pain. \\nBy using a radioactively labelled alpha-MSH analogue, 125I-NDP-MSH, we demonstrated an increased binding in the outer layer of the dorsal horn, suggesting an upregulation of spinal MC4R in neuropathic pain. Both acute and chronic intrathecal administration of MC-R agonists to CCI rats increased cold allodynia (as measured by withdrawal latency to immersion in 4.5oC water bath) and mechanical allodynia (as measured by withdrawal threshold to von Frey filaments). Conversely, the MC4R antagonist SHU9119 decreased symptoms, suggesting that blockade of the spinal MC4R alleviates neuropathic pain. \\nIn the dorsal horn the MC-R agonist alpha-MSH as well as the endogenous opioid agonist beta-endorphin, both derived from POMC, are present. Also the mu- and delta-opioid receptors (for which beta-endorphin displays high affinity) are located in the same area, suggesting the presence of both a functional melanocortin and opioid system in the dorsal horn.\\nWe hypothesize that the anti-allodynic effects of SHU9119 are caused by blockade of a tonic influence of alpha-MSH on nociception,  through the MC4R. This could reveal tonic anti-nociceptive effects of beta-endorphin (through the opioid receptors), coreleased with alpha-MSH. By administering naloxone (which increased pain symptoms) we furhter supported this hypothesis. \\nIn addition we investigated a possible interaction of the spinal melanocortin and opioid systems, and tested whether opioid effectiveness could be increased through modulation of the spinal melanocortin system activity. A low dose of naloxone (which by itself had no effect on nociception) was able to block the anti-allodynic effect of SHU9119, confirming an interaction between the two systems. Combined treatment with SHU9119 and morphine resulted in additive anti-allodynic effects. \\nBased upon these results we suggest that MC4R antagonists, possibly combined with opioids, might contribute to the treatment of human neuropathic pain.  \\nIn addition to the investigation of the role of the melanocortins in neuropathic pain a novel animal model for neuropathic pain (the sciatic nerve crush) and an alternative method for quantifying mechanical allodynia (the \"CatWalk\") are also described in this thesis.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Part I: Fetal tachyarrhythmias\\n\\nDiagnosis\\nFetal tachycardia is a serious condition warranting specialized evaluation. In chapter 2, methods of diagnosis of fetal tachycardia are described, including doppler and M-mode echocardiography and fetal magnetocardiography. The study presented in chapter 3 describes a method for further delineation in the classification of fetal SVT in short and long VA tachyarrhythmias. \\n\\nConsequences\\nTachyarrhythmia is associated with fetal hydrops. As outlined in chapter 4 and 5, predisposing factors for the development of hydrops seem to be the percentage of time that the tachycardia is present, the gestational age at which the tachycardia occurs, the ventricular rate and the site of origin of the tachycardia. In fetal hydrops, the fetus is at risk for neurological morbidity. In chapter 4, the outcome of 11 fetuses with hydrops as a result of tachyarrhythmia is presented.  \\n\\nTreatment\\nIn the chapters 3, 4 and 7, it is outlined that transplacental treatment is to be preferred above expectant management. The issue of direct fetal therapy is described in chapter 5 and a review of the literature on the various regimens of drugs used in the transplacental treatment of fetal tachycardia is presented. Chapter 6 describes the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of sotalol in pregnancy. The overall success rate of sotalol as a single therapy in the treatment of atrial flutter in the studies presented in chapters 6 and 7, was 63 %, and reached 79 % after the addition of digoxin. The success rates in fetal SVT were 53 % and 74 %, respectively. In the SVT group, there were however, four deaths. \\nLow initiation dosages of sotalol, stepwise dosage increases and close monitoring, especially during the initiation phase are recommended.\\n\\nProtocol in the treatment of fetal tachycardia\\nIn fetal AF, sotalol, with digoxin as a second line drug, should be the treatment of choice (Figure 1). In nonhydropic fetal SVT, a definite clinical advantage of sotalol over other drugs could not be proved. The treatment protocol (Figure 2) therefore shows 2 options. In fetal SVT complicated by hydrops, two options are proposed: flecainide, or a combination of intravenous digoxin and amiodarone (Figure 3). In conclusion, as a result of the studies of this thesis and of the latest international literature, new treatment protocols are proposed and presented. \\n\\n\\nPart II: Fetal ECG in labour, aspects of the intrapartum QT interval \\n\\nIn chapter 9, observations on the intrapartum fetal QT interval in three premature sheep fetuses and one human fetus at term, all being exposed to acute and severe asphyxia, are presented. A shortening of the QT interval is present, shortly after the fetus is exposed to asphyxia, in association with a rise in T/QRS ratio and an increase in blood pressure. In chapter 10, the QT interval in 68 fetuses with signs of severe intrapartum hypoxia also showed a significant shortening of the QT interval. \\nThe fetal QT interval during labour may therefore provide additional information on the condition of the fetus.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Several studies have demonstrated that collagen turnover is important during arterial restructuring. However, the precise mediators involved in collagen turnover are still not known. In order to develop specific inhibitors to prevent arterial restructuring, it is essential to get a better understanding of the molecular pathways involved in collagen turnover. In this thesis, we used a subtraction PCR to identify new candidate proteins that are involved in arterial restructuring and to get a better insight in these pathways. One of the identified proteins using subtraction PCR was the acute phase glycoprotein haptoglobin. Haptoglobin was found to be expressed by adventitial fibroblasts, early after flow changes. In vitro assays demonstrated that haptoglobin is a gelatinase inhibitor and important for cell migration. Furthermore, haptoglobin knockout mice demonstrated delayed arterial restructuring after flow changes.\\nAs NO plays an important role in flow-induced arterial restructuring, we investigated whether arterial haptoglobin expression was regulated via NO. Inhibition of NO synthesis by a aspecific NOS-inhibitor resulted in decreased arterial haptoglobin expression. This coincided with decreased arterial IL-6 expression, which is a well described regulator of haptoglobin expression in the liver. IL-6 knockout mice were used to confirm a regulatory role of IL-6 in arterial haptoglobin expression. However, haptoglobin expression was normal in IL-6 knockout mice, pointing to back-up mechanisms for the regulation of haptoglobin expression.\\nPreviously, sero-epidemiological studies have demonstrated that arthritis and cancer are characterized by increased serum haptoglobin levels. In this thesis, we demonstrated that local expression of haptoglobin is increased in these two pathological tissues that are characterized by enhanced cell migration and matrix turnover.\\nAs haptoglobin is present at high concentrations in the serum, the function of local haptoglobin expression is not completely understood. We therefore investigated whether alterations in haptoglobin glycosylation could explain the necessity of local haptoglobin expression. Haptoglobin expression and glycosylation was studied in balloon dilated rabbit arteries. Balloon dilation increased arterial haptoglobin expression within the first two weeks after injury whereas liver haptoglobin expression remained constant. There were no differences in arterial haptoglobin glycosylation patterns after balloon dilation. However, arterial haptoglobin was differentially glycosylated compared to liver haptoglobin and these arterial haptoglobin glycoforms could be detected in the serum.\\nPreviously, alterations in serum haptoglobin glycosylation have been associated with the progression and outcome of different diseases. As arterial haptoglobin has a characteristic glycosylation pattern, we investigated whether serum haptoglobin glycosylation patterns could serve as serum marker for atherosclerotic disease. There were, however, no differences were found in total serum haptoglobin levels or serum haptoglobin glycosylation patterns between patients with atherosclerosis and patients with only risk factors. In addition, no relation was found between total serum haptoglobin levels and glycosylation patterns with intima-media thickness in the carotid artery, which is a surrogate measure for the extent of atherosclerosis. These results indicate that serum haptoglobin glycosylation patterns are not suitable to use as serum marker for atherosclerotic disease'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Physical fitness and quality of life in children with cystic fibrosis'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['In chapter 1 an introduction on general characteristics of cystic fibrosis (CF) is provided, followed by an overview of literature on exercise studies in children with CF. This literature review showed that children with CF are able to improve their aerobic capacity with short-term training programs but not their pulmonary function. Possibly, long-term adherence to exercise training is necessary to improve clinical prognosis.  Furthermore, an outline for anaerobic training in children with CF is presented. Improvement of anaerobic performance is thought to positively influence participation in daily activities as well as sport activities, which may eventually lead to improvements of health-related quality of life.\\nChapter 2 describes the long-term relationship between changes in peak aerobic performance (VO2peak), pulmonary function and fat-free mass (FFM) in sixty-five children with mild to moderate CF. Over the two-year study period an increase was found for absolute values of FFM, pulmonary function and VO2peak while a decrease was found for predicted values of pulmonary function and VO2peak. It was concluded that changes in VO2peak are associated with changes in pulmonary function and to a lesser degree with changes in fat-free mass.\\nIn chapter 3 the determinants of anaerobic performance are described in thirty-nine children with mild to moderate CF. FFM was found the most important determinant of anaerobic performance. In addition, pulmonary function also contributed significantly to anaerobic performance when FFM was controlled for. An interesting outcome was that subjects with moderate pulmonary dysfunction had higher anaerobic power output per FFM than subjects with mild pulmonary dysfunction. It was concluded that anaerobic energy metabolism may be enhanced with progression of pulmonary disease. \\nChapter 4 describes the validation process of the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire (CFQ) for children with CF in the age from 6 to 13 years (CFQ-C) and their parents (CFQ-P). Internal consistency was acceptable for most domains of the CFQ-C and the CFQ-P. Test-retest reliability was high for all domains and the construct validity of both CFQ questionnaires was good, with moderate to strong correlations between physically oriented CFQ-domains and pulmonary function, nutritional status, inflammation and physical performance. The CFQ-C and the CFQ-P were able to differentiate between two levels of disease severity and the convergence between the two measures was confirmed by strong correlations on observable domains.  Chapter 5 describes the validation process of the CFQ for adolescents and adults (CFQ-14+). Internal consistency was acceptable for most domains of the CFQ-14+ and the test-retest reliability was high for all domain scores. Several domains of the CFQ-14+ were able to differentiate between individuals with varying disease severity and between nourished and malnourished patients. Construct validity of the questionnaire was fair, with moderate to strong correlation between physically orientated domains and pulmonary function. From the results of chapter 4 and 5, it was concluded that the CFQ questionnaires can be used to monitor the health status and quality of life of patients with CF from the age of 6 years throughout adulthood. \\nChapter 6 describes the effects of our anaerobic training program on aerobic and anaerobic exercise performance, pulmonary function, fat-free mass, peripheral muscle force and health-related quality of life. The TG trained two days per week for 12 weeks, with each session lasting 30-45 minutes. The training program consisted of anaerobic activities, lasting 20 to 30 seconds. The control subjects were asked not to change their normal daily activities. The outcome parameters were re-evaluated at the end of the training program and again after a 12-week follow-up period. In the training group significant positive effects were found for aerobic and anaerobic performance and for health-related quality of life. The improvements in anaerobic performance and HRQOL were maintained through a 12-week follow-up period. It was concluded that anaerobic training could be an important component of the physical rehabilitation program of children with CF.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Background\\r\\nAlthough transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) by definition do not cause neurologic deficits, cognitive impairment has been suggested in patients with carotid artery disease (CAD) and ipsilateral TIAs. The cause of this impairment has not been elucidated yet. Thrombo-embolism, but also chronic cerebral hypoperfusion have been suggested to play a role. In this light, surgical interventions that improve the blood flow towards the brain have been promoted to halt or even reverse cognitive deterioration in patients with symptomatic CAD. However, studies on the effect of revascularization surgery on cognition have yielded conflicting results. Before conclusions can be drawn, knowledge is required on the natural history of cognitive impairment in these patients.\\r\\nMethods\\r\\nBetween September 1995 and July 1998, 113 patients with TIAs or moderately disabling stroke attributable to an angiographically proved carotid artery occlusion were recruited from consecutive patients referred to the departments of Neurology or Vascular Surgery of the University Medical Center Utrecht. Neuropsychological assessment, MR investigations (MRI, 1H-MRS, MRA), TCD ultrasonography (CO2 reactivity) and investigations of health-related quality of life (SF-36) and depressive mood took place at three points in time: after inclusion in the study, and 6 and 12 months thereafter. Spouses of the patients were asked to cooperate with the neuropsychological assessment, thus providing a healthy control group.\\r\\nResults\\r\\nAt baseline, 40% of patients with TIAs, and 70% of patients with minor stroke were cognitively impaired. Cognitive ipairment was non-specific in nature, and mild to moderate in severity. Impairment was not restricted to patients with MRI-detected lesions. Mean flow and mean CO2 reactivity ipsilateral to the carotid occlusion were decreased, as well as the median NAA/creatine ratio in non-infarcted white matter. Lactate in non-infarcted white matter was present in 27% of the patients with TIAs, and 47% of the patients with minor stroke. In patients with TIAs, the presence of lactate was a better indicator of cognitive impairment than MRI-detected lesions. In both patients with TIAs as those with stroke, cognitive functioning did not correlate with CO2 reactivity. At follow-up, cognitive functioning improved, but only in patients without lactate in white matter, and without recurrent TIAs at follow-up. A minority of patients underwent carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for stenosis of the contralateral carotid artery. Although CEA led to improved CO2 reactivity and MCA flow on the side of the carotid occlusion, it had no impact on cognitive functioning. Self-perceived quality of life (QoL) was affected, both in patients with TIAs and in those with minor stroke. Depressive mood was associated with impaired QoL on all the subscales of the SF-36, disability according to the modified Rankin scale correlated only with self-perceived physical functioning, whereas cognitive impairment had no impact on QoL.\\r\\nConclusions\\r\\nA substantial portion of patients with symptomatic carotid artery occlusion is cognitively impaired. Cognitive functioning may improve in the 1.5 years after the occurrence of ischemia, if symptoms do not recur. Severity and course of cognitive impairment correlate with measures of metabolism, but not with quantitative flow and CO2 reactivity. CEA for contralateral carotid stenosis results not in improvement of cognitive functioning within one year.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Recipients of  stem cell transplants (SCT) are severely immunocompromised at least during the first 6 months post-transplant. In the introduction of this thesis this immunodeficiency is further described. During the neutropenic period patients are at risk for developing bacterial and fungal infections. Once neutropenia has recovered, opportunistic viral infections are a major threat. Both the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Cytomegalovirus (CMV) are herpes viruses and share the phenomenon that primary infection is followed by latent infection. In immunocompetent individuals latent infection of these viruses is controlled by T cell immunity. However, in immunocompromised patients herpes viruses frequently show reactivations, regularly resulting in herpes virus related disease. In this thesis, T cell immunodeficiency and EBV and CMV infections after allogeneic SCT are studied. \\nIt is shown that several important changes in transplantation procedure have resulted in a more favourable outcome, especially among recipients of grafts from matched unrelated donors (MUD). B cell depletion -in addition to T cell depletion (TCD)- of grafts, a reduced dosage of Antithymocyteglobulin (ATG) and high resolution DNA typing of HLA-antigens all have contributed to this better outcome. The reduced ATG dose and sequence based typing of HLA-antigens may have improved immune recovery in MUD recipients, thereby eliminating CMV-seropositivity as an adverse risk factor for overall survival and transplant related mortality. In recipients of matched related donor (MRD) grafts pre-emptive treatment of CMV reactivations alone was sufficient to eliminate CMV-seropositivity as an adverse risk factor for outcome. The optimal dose of ATG is unknown, however, considering the immunosuppressive and direct toxic effects of ATG, the lowest possible dose should be used. In the setting of SCT with (partially) TCD grafts from MUDs, using limited post-transplant immunosuppression with cyclosporine A, a total dose of 6-8 mg/kg is recommended. A further decrease greatly increases the risk of severe graft-versus-host disease. The future aim is to further improve immune reconstitution post-transplant and to implement new methods for monitoring, prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections. With respect to prevention of EBV-lymphoproliferative disorders, it is important to know the most frequent transmission route of EBV re-infections. Further studies using LMP-1 fingerprinting for strain identification of patient, donor and partner samples are necessary.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Due to advanced medical treatment, more children with spina bifida survive into adulthood. Most outcome studies in the field of spina bifida research focus on disease aspects (\\x91pathology\\x92) and its relation to one of the domains in the \\x91disablement process\\x92 such as physical functioning, cognitive abilities, or psychosocial adjustment. From these studies it became clear that spina bifida has significant impact on the health of individuals, but little is known on \\x91health related quality of life\\x92 (HRQL).\\nThe main goal of this thesis is to get more insight into the different domains of the \\x91disablement process\\x92 in children with spina bifida. We were especially interested in how \\x91pathology\\x92, \\x91impairments\\x92,\\x91functional limitations\\x92, \\x91disability\\x92 and HRQL relate to each other in order to set relevant and realistic goals for physical therapy treatment. Physical therapy traditionally focuses on improvement of muscle strength and muscle tone, and the prevention of contractures, to optimize childhood development and functioning. However, it is not clear how these impairments relate to functional independence and HRQL. As there is often an intense demand for commitment on children and their families regarding physical therapy, knowledge of determinants of independence is of utmost importance in order to focus \\x93on realistic goals rather than wasting efforts on attempting the impossible\\x94.\\n\\nThe following conclusions can be drawn from this thesis:\\n1. Parameters on the level of \\x91impairments\\x92 are statistically significantly associated with \\x91disability\\x92.\\n2. Ambulation is significantly positively associated with muscle strength of hip abductors and ankle dorso-flexors.\\n3. Good muscle strength, having no contractures and mental ability appears to be much more important for daily life functioning of children with spina bifida than other medical indicators.\\n4.With regard to independence in mobility, good muscle strength, especially of knee extensors, having no contractures, and good mental ability, appears to contribute more to independence than lesion level and shunt status.\\n5. Being independent in mobility appears to contribute more to HRQL than being independent in self-care or being wheelchairdependent.\\n6.  In young children (= 7.5 years) with spina bifida, PEDI-scores were below the mean, but still within normal ranges with the exception of scores on mobility, whereas in older children (> 7.5 years) scores were deviant in all domains.\\n7. Most children with sacral level paralysis have gross motor problems, more severe in myelomeningocele than in lipomyelomenigocele. In both groups caregiver assistance was needed for a prolonged period, especially regarding bladder and bowel management.\\n8. Although patients with myelomeningocele were more disabled than those with other types of spina bifida, perceived competence in the latter group was not better.\\n9. Psycho-social support might be needed in children with other types of spina bifida and minor disabilities as well as in those with myelomeningocele with severe disabilities. \\n10. After neurosurgical untethering, late deterioration of motor andambulation level occurs in a minority of patients. Deterioration and retethering is mainly seen in patients with (lipo)myelomeningocele and not in patients with other types of spinal dysraphism.\\n11. Magnitude of curvature significantly decreases after spinal fusion.\\n12. Within the first six months after spinal fusion, more caregiver assistance is needed in self-care and mobility.                      It takes about 12 months to recover to pre-surgery level, while a small improvement is seen afterwards.\\n13. After spinal fusion, ambulation can become difficult in patients who are exercise walkers prior to surgery.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['This thesis is based upon a study of a Dutch family with a unique skeletal dysplasia first described by Elsbach in 1959. Because of the presence of microepiphyses, he called this disorder bilateral hereditary micro-epiphyseal dysplasia (BHMED) and distinguished it from more common multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (MED). Clinical features were early onset of bilateral symmetric synchronic complaints of pain in hip and knee, and radiographically small epiphyses of the hip joint. Although Elsbach regarded this disorder as different from common multiple epiphyseal dysplasia, others suggested that it was only a variant of common MED. Recent advances in molecular genetics allow for solving this etiological question of lumping versus splitting of entities by molecular genetic identification of the basic gene defects. Furthermore, the original family requested genetic counselling and wanted be informed about the genetic risks to the offspring and to obtain more information about the nature of the disease, which would clearly benefit from resolving the genetic defect underlying the skeletal disorder in their family. \\nThe aim of the study was to obtain answers to four main questions: \\n1.Is BHMED indeed a separate clinical entity among the MEDs?\\n2.What are the diagnostic radiographic features of BHMED?\\n3.What is the molecular genetic basis of BHMED?\\n4.What is the diagnostic value of metacarpophalangeal pattern (MCPP) profile analysis?\\nThe study included the original family including 40 years follow-up period, as well as new family members born since the first report by Elsbach. The clinical and radiological findings confirmed Elsbach\\x92s conclusion that the disease in this family, designated by him as BHMED, indeed represents a separate entity that can be differentiated from common MED. Short stature was not only observed in affected patients, but also though to a lesser degree in their healthy siblings and the unaffected parents, which was explained by height-related partner choice consistently over several generations. \\nThrough linkage analysis, three candidate gene loci, EDM1-3, were excluded. A whole genome scan showed linkage to a region on chromosome 2 harbouring a functional candidate gene, matrilin-3. Mutation analysis of matrilin-3 revealed a previously unreported pathogenic missense mutation in the Von Willebrand domain of this gene (G382C base pair substitution leading to an A128P amino acid substitution). The mutation segregated completely with the affection status defined by both clinical and radiographic diagnostic criteria. \\nThe metacarpophalangeal pattern (MCPP) profile observed in BHMED was found to be different from that of one of the currently known common MED variants (EDM2) and was consistent with the clinical diagnosis, the radiological observations and the segregation of the matrilin-3 mutation. \\nBHMED affected patients were frequently affected by secondary aspecific osteoarthritis. In view of the current findings, the authors suggest that subtler sequence variants of this gene or its promotor may predispose to more common osteoarthritis, and that this deserves further studies in large population-based samples.\\nThis investigation proved that BHMED is indeed a separate variant within the MED group that is more heterogeneous than thought before. Furthermore, the identification of the gene defect helped the genetic counselling of family members, especially in support of the clinical and radiological diagnosis'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['New treatment strategies for multiple myeloma by targeting Bcl-2 and the mevalonate pathway'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Multiple myeloma is a B-lineage neoplasia. Enhanced proliferation and defects in the regulation of programmed cell death account for the expansion of the malignant clone. Emergence of drug resistance is the primary cause of treatment failure in myeloma. Various studies have indicated that inhibition of drug-induced apoptosis is an important mechanism of drug resistance in various human cancers including myeloma. Understanding of mechanisms that regulate apoptosis and growth will allow for the development of new biologically-based therapies that overcome drug resistance and reduce myeloma tumor growth. This thesis has focused on the role of Bcl-2 and the mevalonate pathway in the maintenance of myeloma tumor cell survival and resistance to drug-induced apoptosis. \\r\\n\\r\\nBcl-2 in myeloma \\r\\nIn myeloma, the role of Bcl-2 is unclear. The importance of Bcl-2 in drug-induced apoptosis in myeloma was investigated by using an antisense approach. G3139 is a oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) complementary to the first 6 codons of the Bcl-2 mRNA. Treatment of ex vivo purified myeloma tumor cells with Bcl-2 antisense ODNs resulted in a sequence-specific reduction of Bcl-2 mRNA, followed by a sequence-specific decrease in Bcl-2 protein levels. Down-regulation of Bcl-2 resulted in enhanced sensitivity of both chemosensitive and chemoresistant myeloma tumor cells to dexamethasone or doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. Based on these in vitro findings a clinical trial was started to evaluate the effect of Bcl-2 antisense in 10 myeloma patients that were heavily pretreated. G3139 was administered for 7 days as a continuous intravenous infusion and VAD chemotherapy was started at day 4. Administration of Bcl-2 antisense resulted in a moderate reduction of Bcl-2 protein levels in peripheral blood circulating myeloma cells. Four (40%) patients achieved a partial response and 3 (30%) a minor response, indicating that 70% of the patients responded to the combination of G3139 and VAD. Five out 7 responding patients were refractory to VAD chemotherapy alone. The responses observed in our trial provide the proof of principle that Bcl-2 protein is involved in drug resistance in vivo and that inhibition of Bcl-2 expression increases the in vivo therapeutic efficacy of cytotoxic agents in myeloma. \\r\\n\\r\\nMevalonate pathway in myeloma\\r\\nThe mevalonate pathway produces a variety of products including farnesyl and geranylgeranyl isoprenoids and cholesterol. In the second part of this thesis, we focused on the importance of the mevalonate pathway in myeloma. Blocking of the mevalonate pathway through the inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by lovastatin induced apoptosis and inhibited proliferation of myeloma and lymphoma cells, moreover lovastatin also sensitized these cells to cytotoxic agents. These effects were due to the inhibition of geranylgeranylation through the depletion of geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP) by lovastatin, whereas depletion of farnesylpyrophosphate (FPP) leading to inhibition of farnesylation had no or only minor effects. The role of protein geranylgeranylation in the regulation of myeloma cell growth and survival was confirmed in experiments with specific inhibitors of geranylgeranyl transferase I (GGTase I) and farnesyl transferase (FTase). Inhibition of GGTase I activity reduced proliferation and induced apoptosis, with only small effects of inhibition of FTase. Inhibition of geranylgeranylation either by depletion of GGPP or inhibition of GGTase I activity reduced expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1, which is a key regulator of survival in myeloma. Studies using specific inhibitors of geranylgeranylated proteins suggested that Rac-1 and/or Cdc42 GTPases play a role in myeloma cell growth, but not survival. Introduction of dominant-negative Tat-Rac-1 protein reduced proliferation, whereas constitutively active Tat-Rac-1 stimulated proliferation of myeloma cells. Both dominant-negative and constitutively active Rac-1 had no effect on myeloma cell survival. These data suggest that Rac-1 plays a role in myeloma cell proliferation, and that the suppression of proliferation by lovastatin and GGTase I inhibitors may be, at least in part, due to inhibition of geranylgeranylation of Rac-1. These preclinical studies indicate that inhibition of geranylgeranylation represents a novel therapeutic approach in the treatment of myeloma and lymphoma.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Only a small number of patients with epilepsy undergo a neurosurgical operation in which the area from which epileptic neurons generate seizures is removed. From a neuropsychological perspective several different assessments and outcomes are being looked at.\\r\\nChapter 2 deals with research on the Wada test. In this test, the language-dominant hemisphere can be assessed and can be predicted which individuals are at risk for post-surgical global amnesia. The Wada test is thought to be sensitive to bilateral dysfunction of the critical memory function in the temporomesial area. We tried to do the reverse. If the Wada test showed a lower memory score in one hemisphere, could this be related to the side of focus? We applied logistic regression in which we included four variables: both memory scores after injection, memory of a story told before injection, and an attention score. With this set of variables the side of a focus can be classified in 85% of the patients. Additionally, false prediction results in a slightly lowered chance of becoming seizure free.\\r\\nThe neurosurgeon has the option of operating under local anaesthesia in which the operation can be carried out without damaging the language areas. In chapter 3 we looked at cognitive differences between both procedures six months after surgery. We found a relationship between the extent of the removed brain tissue in the superior temporal gyrus under general anaesthesia and a lowered verbal IQ and verbal comprehension.\\r\\nIn chapter 4 we described a study on differences in auditory rhythm perception in both cerebral hemispheres. It is known that longer visual rhythms are better (holistically) processed by the right hemisphere. We used a rhythm test which consisted of 30 pairs of rhythms varying in length. We expected that the removal of brain tissue in right-sided resections should lead to a diminished recognition of longer rhythms. This appeared to be the case.\\r\\nChapter 5 deals with the effects of an operation on intelligence. It is known from literature that half a year after left temporal lobe surgery verbal intelligence shows a slight decrease and performal intelligence shows less increase after right surgery than after left temporal lobe surgery. We followed now patients 6 years after surgery (with assessments after six months, two years and six years). This study showed that the decrease of verbal IQ after left temporal lobe surgeries is undone after two years. From two to up to six years this IQ shows an increase of up to normal values.\\r\\nChapter 6 is devoted to long term follow-up of verbal memory. This function is purported to be a risk function in left temporal lobe surgery. The study revealed a specific group at risk. This group consists of patients with mesiotemporal sclerosis with an atrophic hippocampus. Verbal acquisition and consolidation in general shows an ongoing decrease up to two years after surgery, but the verbal memory of patients with a diagnosis of mesiotemporal sclerosis shows an ongoing decrease up to six years after surgery.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['To create an environment where surgeons receive real-time feedback about their instrument position, computer technologies were integrated in surgical procedures. This type of surgical technology is referred to as Computer Assisted Surgery (CAS). CAS offers the possibility to continuously monitor the position of surgical instruments in relation to the patient\\x92s anatomy intraoperatively. Therefore, the position of surgical instruments is superimposed virtually on single shot radiographic images in real time. This feature promises enhanced accuracy and consequently less morbidity combined with a reduction in radiation exposure. \\nThe goal of this thesis was to evaluate the hypothesis of high accuracy and reproducibility of CAS in orthopaedic and trauma surgery. \\n\\nIn Chapter 3 the accuracy of the fluoroscopy based navigation system (Medivision, Oberdorf, CH.) was evaluated in a laboratory study performed in 20 sawbones of a proximal femur. The virtual position of the reamer appeared to be reliable in 97% of cases when considering an inaccuracy of = 2mm as clinically irrelevant. \\nChapter 4 describes the results of a cadaver study investigating the reliability and reproducibility of femoral anteversion angles and lengths provided by the navigation system (Medivision, Oberdorf, CH.) during femoral nailing. Length measurements provided by the navigation system showed to be reproducible and accurate enough for clinical use. The rotation measurements, however,  were reproducible with a difference of almost six degrees but not accurate enough to prevent malrotation.\\nIn chapter 5 virtual planning of an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) was analysed. Notch impingement and elongation for selected graft positioning could be predicted by displaying the kinematics of a virtual ACL on a monitor. This study indicated that computer assisted planning may reduce the inter-surgical variance to 5 mm for positioning the femoral and tibial tunnels. Moreover, the experience level of the surgeon did not effect the planning process. \\nChapter 6 describes the feasibility and pitfalls of CAS in the treatment of femoral neck fractures with a DHS in a small patients group. This study showed that fluoroscopy based navigation in the treatment of femoral neck fractures with a DHS is feasible. However, the technique used in this study was too complicated to use in daily practice. \\n\\nIn Chapter 7 the results of CAS iliosacral screw fixations were compared with the results of a conventionally operated prospective control group. This study showed that fluoroscopy based CAS is a save and intuitive technique for performing posterior pelvic screw fixation. The fluoroscopy time was decreased with a factor 2.5. The use of the navigation system did not lead to a longer procedure time and may in the future even accelerate the procedure. \\n\\nIn summary fluoroscopy based CAS is accurate enough to rely on in experimental and clinical situations. This thesis proved several clinical benefits for CAS when used for navigated guidewire insertion in iliosacral screw fixation compared with the conventional technique. The CAS femoral anteversion control module must be improved before clinical use. Computer-assisted ACL grafting has to be evaluated in a controlled study. However, it is to be expected that CAS will soon evaluate into a clinically accepted and mandatory technique in some fields of orthopaedic and trauma surgery'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Isolated lung perfusion is an experimental surgical technique for the treatment of pulmonary metastases in order to improve the current 5-year survival of approximately 40 % after surgical resection of manually palpable metastases. Several drugs have been tested in animals models and five phase I studies on this subject have been performed now. Efficacy results are disappointing probably due to the invasive nature of the treatment which implies just one or two sessions per patient. Furthermore, only single-agent therapy have been studied yet. This thesis focuses on a relatively new anticancer (pro)drug gemcitabine which is an deoxycytidine analogue. Due to several self-potentiating mechanisms this drug inhibits cell proliferation efficiently and it is a very interesting drug to combine with other drugs resulting in synergistic activity. Clinical anticancer activity has been described against colon, pancreas, ovary, breast carinoma and NSCLC. Acute and chronic toxicity, pharmacokinetic parameters and efficacy are studied. In preparation of less invasive models, first-pass effect of lung tissue during isolated lung perfusion gemcitabine is investigated. \\r\\nToxicity studies showed a higher maximally tolerated dose without major lung fibrosis compared with intravenous treatment resulting in significantly higher lung levels. Efficacy studies proved significant survival benefit compared to either untreated controls and intravenously treated rats.\\r\\nBlood flow occlusion has been studied in order to perfuse lung tissue  without clamping the pulmonary veins. Significantly higher lung levels and significantly lower serum levels of gemcitabine were measured compared to systemic infusion. These findings open a way to less invasive catheterization models with balloon catheters which can be performed for several times per patient in preparation for surgery of manually palpable metastases.  \\r\\nCombinations of gemcitabine, cisplatin and melphalan were studies in order to find synergistic activity. Major survival benefit was observed after isolated lung perfusion with gemcitabine combined with melphalan. Smaller synergistic action was shown after treatment with cisplatin and melphalan. \\r\\nBased on these results, a phase I trial will start studying the combination therapy with gemcitabine and melphalan. A recent phase I study with melphalan in our center showed the maximally tolerated dose of melphalan in isolated lung perfusion to be 45 mg.

       "  'Description': ['Granulocytes are thought to play an important role in the maintenance and progression of chronic diseases, such as COPD, allergic asthma, and rheumatoid arthritis. Despite the importance of granulocytes in these diseases surprisingly little is known about the processes occurring in vivo that regulate inappropriate granulocyte functioning. In this thesis, gene expression of neutrophils has been analyzed in vitro and in vivo, to characterize chronic systemic inflammation and identify mediators that are playing a role in the pathogenesis of COPD. To understand the finely tuned process of neutrophil functioning in vivo, it is also necessary to define components of the signaling pathways responsible for the priming and activation of effector functions in granulocytes. In this thesis, research questions were addressed, concerning granulocyte functioning in vitro and in vivo.\\n\\nAre changes in gene expression of peripheral blood neutrophils a result of the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying the development of COPD and can these gene profiles be used to define penotypes and severity of the disease?\\nExposure of neutrophils to cytokines or chemokines, results in their activation and changes in gene expression profiles. In Chapter 2, we utilise gene array technology and real time reverse trancriptase polymerase chain reaction to define the gene expression profiles of peripheral blood neutrophils of COPD patients compared with in vitro stimulated neutrophils. In Chapter 3, we use the same techniques, to investigate differences between peripheral blood neutrophils of COPD patients during a stable phase of their disease and during an exacerbation. Furthermore, we investigated the kinetics of activation of peripheral blood neutrophils in COPD patients in a longitudial setting.\\n\\nWhat is the role of Src kinases and small GTPase Rac in granulocyte functioning? \\nTo address this question, we use pharmacological inhibitors and a recently developed technique of protein transduction. In Chapter 5 we investigate the role of Src kinases in neutrophil functioning, whereas in Chapter 6 the role of Rac is investigated in peripheral blood eosinophil functioning by introducing a constitutively active mutant into these cells. In Chapter 7, we describe an ELISA technique developed for non-radioactive semi-quantitative analysis of the activation state of several kinases in adherent and suspension cells using phosphospecific antibodies'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['The protective effect of melanocortins on cisplatin-induced hearing loss'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Cisplatin is widely used for the treatment of a variety of tumors. Unfortunately, the therapeutic effect of cisplatin is limited because patients can develop a high frequency hearing loss in both ears. Recovery of this hearing loss is observed sporadically. Animal studies have shown that chronic cisplatin administration leads to loss of outer hair cells (OHCs) in the inner ear (cochlea), with those in the basal turn most severely affected. Furthermore, cisplatin also damages the cells of the stria vascularis and the spiral ganglion. \\r\\nNowadays several groups of protective compounds have been found that have beneficial effects upon cisplatin-induced hearing loss. Melanocortins, which include the endogenous peptide ?-melanocyte stimulating hormone (?-MSH) and the synthetic analogue ORG2766, have shown to be able to partially prevent cisplatin-induced ototoxicity. However, the exact mechanism of the protective effect of the melanocortins is still unclear.\\r\\nThe aim of my thesis was to characterize the protective effect of the melanocortins ?-MSH, ORG 2766 and a new synthetic melanocortin melanotan-II (MT-II). First guinea pigs were implanted with a permanent electrode for measuring the electrocochleograms and injected with cisplatin and one of the melanocortins or saline (control) until a threshold loss of 40 dB at 8 kHz was observed. Next both treatments were terminated but the electrocochleography measurements were continued for another 14 days to study the recovery. These experiments showed that both ?-MSH and ORG 2766 are able to protect the inner ear from cisplatin-induced hearing loss. MT-II did not show an effect. Furthermore it was shown that treatment with the melanocortins partly prevented the damage to the OHCs. Unfortunately, these experiments showed large variations between the treated animals. Therefore we introduced a new animal model in which both an electrode and a mini-osmotic pump were attached to the cochlea. First cisplatin was applied directly into the cochlea by means of the osmotic pump system and ?-MSH was administered systemically. Subsequently an experiment with a mirrored experimental design was executed, in which ?-MSH was applied directly into the cochlea and cisplatin systemically. Also in both these experiments a protective effect of ?-MSH was observed. Since cisplatin was administered through a different route than ?-MSH (local versus systemic) it can be assumed that the protective effect of ?-MSH is not caused through a direct interaction of ?-MSH with cisplatin, but that ?-MSH induces its effects directly in the inner ear. If ?-MSH would have had a direct interaction with cisplatin or a systemic effect, such as induced clearance, it would decrease the antineoplastic effect of cisplatin and thereby undermine the clinical relevance. The results in this thesis also show that the protective effects of ?-MSH and other melanocortins are rather small and vary considerably between individuals. This hampers the introduction of melanocortins as an otoprotective agent in patients. However, improvement of the effect of melanocortins by optimizing the treatment cannot be excluded. Summarizing, the research performed in this thesis brought us a step closer to the prevention of cisplatin-induced ototoxicity. Furthermore we learned more about the apparently very complex mechanism of the toxic effects of cisplatin in the inner ear'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) is an advanced form of radiotherapy; the beam intensity can thereby be modulated. IMRT can be used to create a highly conformal dose distribution around a tumor, while reducing the dose to the surrounding normal tissue. IMRT can also be used to deliver a heterogeneous dose within the tumor. A higher dose is delivered to areas of high risk, such as a part of the tumor containing more tumor cells. In this thesis, IMRT is applied to the irradiation of breast and oropharyngeal cancer. \\r\\nAn IMRT technique for irradiation of breast cancer has been developed, based on the on the division of the tangential fields in four segments shaped by a multi-leaf collimator. The shape of these segments was obtained from an equivalent path length map of the irradiated volume. Using this IMRT technique, a more homogeneous dose distribution was achieved compared to the conventional technique. Furthermore the dose to the lung was reduced.\\r\\nA more complex case is the treatment of oropharyngeal cancer. Different dose levels are delivered to the primary tumor, the volume containing subclinical malignant disease and the lymph nodes. The dose to the spinal cord, brain and parotid gland should be minimized. The relation between the quality of the treatment plan and the number of beams in combination with the number of segments was investigated in order to obtain a clinically acceptable and deliverable plan. Seven beams were sufficient to achieve acceptable dose homogeneity while the dose to the spinal cord and brain was acceptable. The dose to the parotid glands was reduced without compromising the dose to the targets.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpecial attention should be paid to the localization of the tumor when using IMRT to assure that the dose is delivered at the right location.  A margin, taken for geometrical uncertainties, is therefore added to prevent underdosage of the target volumes. Due to this margin, the dose to the surrounding healthy tissues increases. In a theoretical study it was shown that a realistic reduction of this margin might result in a reduction of the probability for radiation induced xerostomia of approximately 20%.\\r\\nIn order to reduce the margin, the reliability and toxicity of the use of implanted gold markers for position verification during the irradiation of head-and-neck cancer was investigated.  These markers were visualized using an a-Si flat panel imager. No acute major complications were observed. In order to prevent movement of the markers, they should be deep-seated. The random error of the geometric uncertainties obtained without correction during radiotherapy was 1-2 mm.\\r\\nThe intrafraction motions of the larynx were investigated during radiotherapy using an a-Si flat panel imager. Motions occurred due to swallowing, breathing, or movement of the tongue. An extra margin of approximately 3.5 mm should be applied to take into account frequent motions, which are probably related to breathing.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo different segmental IMRT techniques have been developed in this thesis for respectively irradiation of the breast and the oropharynx.  Both techniques have been implemented clinically.  Furthermore, the position verification and intra-fraction motion for head-and-neck irradiation have been investigated'],\n",

Any decrease in oxygen causes a prompt fall in energy production and results in severe ischemic brain damage.\\nSince surgery of the aortic arch requires manipulation and exclusion of the cerebral vascularization  the utilisation of optimal methods of cerebral function preservation is necessary to avoid ischemic brain injuries.\\nCurrent brain protection strategies, involving reduction of cerebral oxygen consumption and/or maintenance of cerebral blood flow, include: Deep Hypothermic Circulatory Arrest (DHCA), Retrograde Cerebral Perfusion (RCP),  Antegrade Selective Cerebral Perfusion (ASCP).\\nSince 1995, at the St Antonius Hospital (Nieuwegein, Netherlands), ASCP is, for the following reasons the method of choice for brain protection when aortic reconstruction is anticipated to require a period of circulatory arrest longer than 30 minutes:\\n\\n? As compared to DHCA with or without RCP, ASCP provides a much longer period of safe circulatory arrest. We have demonstrated that the extent of the aortic replacement and an ASCP time of longer than 90 minutes are not associated with an increased risk of hospital mortality and adverse neurologic outcome intended as the postoperative occurrence of permanent and transient neurologic dysfunctions\\n? ASCP can be used with moderate (instead of deep) hypothermia. Cooling down the patient\\x92s core temperature to only 22°-25°C instead of 10°-18°C, is supposed to have various advantages such as the reduction of the duration of extracorporeal circulation with improved survival and reduced coagulative complications.\\n? the entire experimental literature, comparatively investigating the effects of ASCP, DHCA  and RCP on  brain energy metabolism, supports the idea that ASCP is superior to the other methods in maintaining an aerobic brain metabolism even after a prolonged period of circulatory arrest as demonstrated by morphologic, histopathologic and biochemical findings as well as by behavioural and clinical examinations\\n\\nAim of the present thesis was: 1) to review our experience with ASCP during surgery of the thoracic aorta, 2) to determine the predictive risk factors for hospital mortality  and adverse neurologic outcome, 3) to compare survival, neurologic outcome and systemic morbidity in patients undergoing aortic procedures requiring short periods of circulatory arrest with ASCP and DHCA, 4) to compare survival and neurologic outcome  in patients receiving 2 different technique for arch vessels reimplantation to the aortic arch: the separated graft technique and the en bloc technique.\\nOur findings were as follows:\\nThe hospital mortality rate ranged from   to, permanent and transient neurological dysfunction occurred in    of patients.\\nDuration of cerebral perfusion and the extent of the aortic replacement were not indicated as predictive risk factor for hospital mortality and adverse neurologic outcome. Among the preoperative variables, type A dissection, urgency and history of stroke/TIA, emerged as the most important risk factors for hospital mortality and adverse neurologic outcome. The duration of CPB was the only intraoperative factor indicated as a risk factor for hospital mortality and neurologic outcome by our statistical analysis. Patients undergoing ascending aorta/hemiarch replacement with ASCP had similar survival and neurological outcome of those receiving DHCA as a method of brain protection but presented a better postoperative pulmonary and renal function recovery. As compared to the en bloc technique , the separated graft technique may result in several technical advantages and in reduced durations of extracorporeal circulation and myocardial ischemia.\\n\\n\\nIn our experience, ASCP has been demonstrated to be a safe and reliable method of brain protection  allowing complex aortic procedures to be performed with acceptable results in terms of hospital mortality and adverse neurologic outcome.'],\n",

Symptoms can be classified as storage symptoms or voiding symptoms, e.g. weak urinary flow and urgency-frequency. Several treatment options are possible. Transurethral resection of the prostate is the gold standard for surgical therapy.\\nThere is a correlation between prostatic obstruction and these symptoms. However, there is some evidence that patients who are not obstructed benefit from surgery. Two studies presented in this thesis compare obstructed with unobstructed patients who underwent TURP because of LUTS and associated BPH.\\nTURP shows several complications like bleeding. New surgical modalities have been introduced to match the results of TURP, but with less complications. Several studies described in this thesis compare the results of TURP with contact laser prostatectomy (CLP) and electrovaporization (Evap). Costs of these treatments are nowadays of great importance and are analyzed in a separate chapter. A special group of patients with LUTS and BPH who suffer from bleeding disorders or use anticoagulants is treated with laser therapy.\\nMaterials and methods:\\n132 patients were urodynamically measured before and 6 months after TURP. They also completed validated questionnaires to quantify symptoms and subjective results. Urodynamic outcome was compared to subjective outcome. A subgroup af patients with a Schaefer grade of 1 or 2 (unobstructed or equivocal) were compared to patients who were obstructed according to Schaefer.\\nA randomized, controlled study was conducted comparing TURP, CLP and Evap. Fifty, 45 and 46 patients were included respectively. Preoperatively and postoperatively up to 7 years tests were performed, including urodynamics, uroflowmetry, validated symptom questionnaires, morbidity and mortality. A separate cost analysis was performed. A prospective, controlled study of high risk patients was conducted, in which 30 patients with bleeding disorders or using anticoagulants were treated with laser therapy. They were compared to 45 normal risk patients undergoing laser therapy. \\nResults and conclusions:\\nPatients with a high obstruction grade benefited most from TURP, but those who were not obstructed showed also clinical relevant improvements in objective and subjective parameters.\\nUrodynamic, uroflowmetric, symptomatic and subjective results, morbidity and mortality were very similar for all three groups at several times during the first year postoperatively and during long-term follow-up up to 7 years (mean follow-up 4.3 years). Costs were lowest for Evap and almost similar for CLP and TURP. Laser therapy is a safe and effective operation for high-risk patients'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['A chronic digestive disorder can be accompanied by -sometimes embarrassing- symptoms and complaints, such as pain, lack of energy, flatulency or incontinence, which can affect the social position of patients. In addition, diet commitments, or worries about toilet facilities can have a serious impact on social activities. The present study was conducted to provide a basis for preventive interventions in order to support young patients in their development with a maximum of equal possibilities in society. \\r\\nCentral to this thesis is the impact of being diagnosed with a chronic digestive disorder, such as an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), chronic liver disease, congenital digestive disorder, coeliac disease or food allergy, on the social position of adolescents and young adults. Secondly, it was aimed to investigate whether the type of disease and disease burden characteristics imply risk factors for possible difficulties in the social position. In addition, the contribution of coping was studied. The study was conducted within a theoretical framework (based on the Disablement process model of Jette and Verbrugge, 1994) which is presented in chapter one. On the basis of this model, the following research questions formed the starting-point of this thesis: \\r\\n1) Do various chronic digestive disorders, i.e. IBD, chronic liver diseases, congenital digestive disorders, coeliac disease and food allergy, have a negative impact on the social position of adolescents and young adults? Which specific aspects of the social position are negatively affected by a chronic digestive disorder?\\r\\n2) How can the burden of a chronic digestive disorder in adolescents and young adults be described, in terms of daily manifestations, compared to population controls?\\r\\n3) Does burden of disease constitutes a risk factor for school performance and leisure activities of adolescents and young adults with chronic digestive disorders?\\r\\n4) Does burden of disease constitutes a risk factor for the labour market position of young adult patients with chronic digestive disorders?\\r\\n5) Do coping strategies differ between several diagnostic groups and population controls? Do they differ between various age groups?\\r\\n6) Does the use of coping strategies contribute to school performance and leisure activities of adolescents and young adults with chronic digestive disorders? \\r\\nIn total 758 patients, categorized in five diagnostic groups, and 306 population-based controls in the age of 12 to 24 years participated in the study. Details on the background of this study, on the recruitment procedures for patients and controls and on the measurement methods can be found in chapter one. The research questions are successively studied in the following chapters. In addition, one chapter pays attention to the factor structure of the Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations (CISS-21) because it was used in a younger target group than it originally was developed for. Finally, chapter seven discusses the main results. In this chapter, a strength and weakness analysis of this study is given as well, followed by a summary of the most significant conclusions. The chapter closes with recommendations for physicians, for patients and their parents, as well as for future research.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['RNA Interference in Caenorhabditis elegans : Mechanism and Application'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Viruses exploit their host by using many compounds of the host and cause damage by replication and spreading through the organism. Transposons are DNA elements that can move and multiply themselves within their host genome. As a result, they can cause damaging mutations. This thesis is about a defense mechanism against viruses and transposons, which is called RNA interference (RNAi). This mechanism is conserved in many organisms including plants, fungi, mouse, human and the fruit fly Drosophila. \\n Much effort is used to unravel the mechanism underlying RNAi. Double stranded RNA (dsRNA) is the initiator of the process. First, the dsRNA is cleaved into small pieces (siRNAs). Next, these effecter molecules bind to RNAs. These RNAs are subsequently cleaved and degraded. Viruses and transposons can no longer replicate or spread due to the degradation of their RNAs. RNAi can also be applied to target specific RNAs. This is done to study gene functions. By analysis of the effects of RNAi mediated destruction of an mRNA, which results in loss of the protein, information on the function of a gene can be obtained. It is also possible to use RNAi to improve food products or in disease treatment. In order to use RNAi in the different applications it is necessary to know more about the mechanism. \\n During my research I have identified components involved in RNAi. I have used the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. This a small worm, which has been studied for many years by investigators of different specialities. Therefore, many details about this organism are known and numerous research methods are developed. \\n Chapter 1 of this thesis gives an overview of what is currently known about the mechanism of RNAi. Chapter 2 is about an amplification step in the RNAi mechanism. RRF-1 is an enzyme implicated in this process. We propose that this enzyme produces new dsRNA using the RNA that has to be broken down as a template. This results in more effecter molecules that help to finish the RNAi process. \\n Chapter 3 concerns RRF-3, a family member of RRF-1. RRF-3 seems to inhibit RNAi; removal of RRF-3 results in an increase in the efficiency of RNAi. This can be useful when RNAi is applied. \\n We used the worms without RRF-3 to generate new data on the genes of C. elegans. This is described in chapter 4. Each mRNA was targeted using RNAi and the effects on the worms were determined. New information on approximately 400 genes was obtained. \\n Another aspect of RNAi is the spreading of the process throughout the worm. The dsRNA that triggers RNAi (or a modified form) is able to spread; this results in mRNA breakdown in distant tissues. Chapter 5 discusses several components that seem to be involved in the spreading of RNAi in C. elegans.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Fibrinogen plays a major role in haemostatic plug formation, not only as the precursor of fibrin and as a mediator in platelet thrombus formation, but also as an adhesive molecule for platelets. Insight in the process underlying thrombosis and haemostasis is of importance in the development of therapeutic anti-thrombotic agents. In vivo, these processes are strongly dependent upon the presence of flowing blood. Therefore, in the present thesis the interactions between platelets and fibrinogen/fibrin during the formation and degradation of a platelet-fibrin(ogen) plug have been investigated under well-defined physiological flow conditions.\\nIn Chapter 2 the contribution of fibrinogen in the formation and packing of a platelet thrombus has been investigated under flow conditions. A perfusion model is developed to study thrombus growth and stability in real-time. For this study, blood was used from a patient suffering from congenital afibrinogenemia. Chapter 3 describes the genetic characterization of the fibrinogen disorder underlying the haemorrhagic condition of this patient. In Chapter 4 the role of ADP was examined in platelet adhesion to fibrinogen and in thrombus formation on collagen. Fibrinogen contains a fibrin-specific region (?312-322), which becomes exposed upon polymerization to fibrin. The participation of this epitope in platelet adhesion to immobilized fibrinogen has been investigated under conditions of flow in Chapter 5. Adhesion of platelets to a fibrin network during fibrinolysis is compared to neutrophil adhesion in Chapter 6. In Chapter 7 a newly developed model is described to study the dynamics of fibrin formation and deposition of flow. Using this model the binding of fibrin was studied to proteins present in the extracellular matrix. In Chapter 8, the findings of the studies described in this thesis are integrated and discussed in broader context and future prospects are presented'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Cardiovascular Endocrinology : The impact of the growth hormone (GH) axis / insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system on the expression of an atherogenic lipid and pro-diabetic phenotype'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Cardiovascular disease due to premature atherosclerotic disease is the major cause of death in Western Societies. Key factors in the origin of premature atherosclerotic disease are lipid disturbances. Although classic lipid parameters predict cardiovascular disease in a huge amount, novel factors in the development of atherosclerosis prove to have an increasing role. Remnants of triglyceride-rich particles for example exhibit high atherogenic properties, in parallel with LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides. In this thesis, both patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and patients with disturbances in their somatotropic axes (adult-onset growth hormone deficiency and acromegaly) have an exaggerated postprandial response concerning remnant-like particles (RLP). Disturbances in the somatotropic axes and cardiovascular mortality are reflected by a U-curve. Recent literature showed changes in the homeostatic balance of somatotropic axes (pituitary GH axis, superposed on paracrine/autocrine IGF systems) during ageing, but also in more cardiovascular disease related clinical features, such as type II diabetes. The origin of this exaggerated postprandial RLP-C response depends on the population tested but was detected on several levels, such as a decreased activity of lipoprotein lipase, increased insulin resistance and a low expression of hepatic LDL receptors  In addition, semi-endpoints of atherosclerotic disease, such as intima media thickness and endothelial function, were closely related to plasma RLP-C levels. Moreover, the postprandial RLP-C response in adult-onset growth hormone deficiency was associated to the increased postprandial pro inflammatory response. In addition to the relationship of the somatotropic balance with a proatherogenic phenotype, a similar relationship was observed with a prodiabetic phenotype (impaired insulin secretion and increased de-novo glucose synthesis). The effect of GH therapy on the balance of gluconeogenesis (GNG) and glycogenolysis in GH deficient subjects was studied with use of latest stable isotope techniques and showed a compensatory response with the synthesis of de-novo glucose during GH therapy. A close relation was found between GNG and IGF-II (an important component of the IGF system, especially in prenatal life, which is 66% genetically determined in its variability of plasma expression). In a case report, the effect of especially high circulating levels of GH, and in a less amount IGF, on the cardiac performance was evident in an overt acromegalic patient. \\nIn conclusion, this thesis gave rise to evidence that RLP is a lipid parameter that further completes an atherogenic lipid phenotype and that disturbances in the somatotropic axis are closely related to the expression of both a proatherogenic and a prodiabetic phenotype. A further analysis may therefore increase knowledge about the key role of GH or components of the IGF system in atherogenesis or atherosclerosis related clinical features.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Robot-assisted endoscopic surgery'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['During the last three years, robot-assisted surgery systems are increasingly being applied in endoscopic surgery. They were introduced with the objective to overcome the challenges of standard endoscopic surgery. With the improvements in manipulation and visualisation that robotic-assistance offers, technologically complex procedures can be performed endoscopically and standard endoscopic procedures can be performed easier and with greater comfort to the surgeon. This serves the purpose of improvement of quality of care.\\r\\nThe goal of this thesis was not only to assess the feasibility of various robot-assisted procedures both in experimental and clinical settings, but also to compare robot-assisted surgery to standard  open  and laparoscopic interventions. All studies aimed at assessing the benefits, challenges and potential pitfalls of using this new technology. \\r\\nIn chapter 1 of this thesis, an introduction into robot-assisted surgery is provided. In chapters 2 to 5 of this thesis, the clinical experience with robot-assisted surgery at the University Medical Centre Utrecht is presented. This started with a series of 40 laparoscopic cholecystectomies as described in chapter 2. This relatively simple procedure was carried out repetitively in order to learn how to work with the, at that time, new technology of robotic assistance under accustomed circumstances. During these procedures only one conversion and no intra-operative complications occurred demonstrating it s safety. In our consecutive series of more complex procedures, as described in chapters 4 and 5, the number of conversions and complications was also low. \\r\\nConcerning the efficiency, operating times were comparable to times mentioned in literature and to times in our institute for procedures performed with standard endoscopic instrumentation. The critical remark that needs to be made, however, is the considerable set-up time we encountered in our series. The time needed to install and sterilely drape the equipment averaged 15 minutes. In chapter 3 we took a closer look at the time-loss and realised that robotic assistance in our institution will burden the operating schedules by approximately 20 minutes per procedure. This time-loss needs to be reduced in order to use robotic systems on a daily basis. \\r\\nIn chapters 6 and 7 of this thesis, two challenging (robot-assisted) laparoscopic surgical procedures were compared to the standard  open  procedure in an experimental setting. It was noticed to be achievable to perform anastomoses with great ease and with a similar result as through the open approach, even though we had no previous experience with performing these procedures in a laparoscopic fashion.\\r\\nFurthermore, both robot-assisted retroperitoneal aortic replacements in pigs and ex-vivo intestinal anastomoses, as described in chapters 8 and 9, were compared to standard endoscopic surgery. For both procedures, clear advantages from robotic assistance were experienced. The vascular anastomoses were performed faster, with fewer errors and lower blood-loss with the use of the robot. A time/action analysis was performed for the intestinal anastomoses and it was demonstrated that even experienced laparoscopic surgeons performed better with use of the robot, even though they had no previous exposure to robot-assisted surgery.\\r\\nIn conclusion, this thesis demonstrates that robot-assisted surgery is safe and efficient in both standard and complex endoscopic interventions. Robotic assistance was proven to offer distinct benefits over standard endoscopic surgery. To implement these systems in day-to-day surgery, the benefits will have to be demonstrated to outweigh the considerable investment of costs and time.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Coeliac disease : investigation of the genetic factors underlying coeliac disease'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Coeliac disease is a common food intolerance with a complex genetic aetiology. It is caused by ingestion of gluten peptides from wheat and related proteins from barley and rye in genetically susceptible individuals. The disease affects the small intestine and leads to abnormalities ranging from the infiltration of the villous epithelium by lymphocytes to total villous atrophy. Clinical symptoms include gastrointestinal complaints such as diarrhoea and abdominal pain but also fatigue, weight loss, anaemia, osteopenia, growth retardation and failure to thrive. Coeliac disease is treated by a life-long gluten-free diet; there is no drug therapy available. \\r\\nOne important genetic factor contributing to coeliac disease is the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DQ locus. The majority of patients are positive for DQ2, and almost all of the remaining patients are positive for DQ8. However, the contribution of the HLA region comprises at most half of the total genetic risk. Therefore, non-HLA genes must also play an important role in coeliac disease pathogenesis, but little is known about the location and identity of these genes. \\r\\nThis thesis describes the first localisation of susceptibility loci for coeliac disease in the Dutch population, in a well-characterized set of affected sibpairs. Linkage analysis revealed that a major locus was located at 19p13.1. This is the first locus to reach genome-wide significance in coeliac disease in an outbred population. Another locus, showing genome-wide suggestive linkage, was identified at 6q21-22. This region is also implicated in other autoimmune disorders and it may therefore harbour a general susceptibility gene for autoimmunity. Both the 19p13.1 and 6q21-22 loci present novel susceptibility loci for coeliac disease. A second genome-wide screen was performed in a four-generation Dutch family with 17 coeliac disease patients. Surprisingly, a third locus, located at 9p21-13, was identified as the major locus in this family. This locus had also been implicated in Scandinavian families with coeliac disease, and probably presents a locus with a small risk to coeliac disease in general. \\r\\nThe 19p13.1 candidate region of 3 Mb, containing 92 genes, was subjected to systematic fine-mapping. Association analysis using microsatellite markers narrowed-down the region to 450 kb and only 12 genes. Subsequent typing of single nucleotide polymorphisms pinpointed the location of the gene to the final 150 kb of this region, with eight possible candidate genes left.\\r\\nFurthermore, the contribution of three functional candidate genes to coeliac disease risk was evaluated: 1. tissue transglutaminase, which modifies gluten peptides into epitopes with strong affinity for HLA-DQ2 and DQ8, resulting in a greatly enhanced T cell response, 2. the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), which has been implicated as a general susceptibility gene for autoimmunity, 3. the cytokine interferon-?, which plays an important role in the pathogenesis of coeliac disease. However, none of these genes showed association with coeliac disease.\\r\\nFinally, an extensive scan of the HLA region was performed to search additional HLA risk loci for coeliac disease, acting independently of DQ2. The results indicated that the contribution of the HLA region is mainly attributable to DQ2 and that a significant contribution of other HLA genes is unlikely.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Venous thrombosis and D-dimers : a new approach in diagnostic management'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['In the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), serial compression ultrasonography is a safe but inefficient strategy as the overall prevalence of DVT in outpatients suspected of thrombosis is low (17-24%) and only 0.9-2.3% of the patients have DVT detected by the second ultrasound. This inefficiency has lead to the development of new non-invasive strategies by which the need for ultrasound can be reduced by using the pre-test clinical probability (PCP) score and D-dimer measurements. As degradation products of cross-linked fibrin, D-dimer levels will rise in the event of fibrinolysis and are an indirect measurement of thrombus formation. In this thesis, the role of the D-dimer assay in the diagnostic management of DVT is  refined.\\nWe demonstrate that it is valid to measure D-dimer concentrations using heparin plasma on routine chemical analyzers in stead of the standard citrate plasma. This finding implicates a significant reduction of the turn-around time. Furthermore, we found D-dimer concentrations to remain stable under various (pre)analytic conditions, making comparison of different studies more feasible. In a second study, we studied the course of D-dimer concentrations in patients undergoing embolisation of pulmonary arteries because of arteriovenous malformations. D-dimer concentrations increased almost immediately after formation of a clot and they remained elevated for at least 8 hours after onset.\\nWe describe the performance of a rapid latex D-dimer assay in the exclusion of DVT and tried to define variables that might restrict the use of the D-dimer in terms of reduced sensitivity, negative predictive value or specificity. We show that the overall sensitivity and negative predictive value of this D-dimer assay are high. The D-dimer test has a good performance in patients with previous venous thromboembolism, but we do not recommend its use in patients using oral anticoagulants because of reduced sensitivity. The D-dimer tests in patients with cancer and in patients over 70 years old are usually positive and may not be worthwhile in terms of low specificity.\\nThe key-question is whether the D-dimer test can replace or reduce the need for CUS in outpatients suspected for having DVT. In a multicenter management study in 812 patients, we show the safety of withholding anticoagulation in patients suspected of having deep venous thrombosis with the combination of a normal D-dimer concentration and a non-high clinical score. This strategy reduces the need for ultrasonography by approximately 30%. In 537 of these patients, extra samples were taken to compare five different D-dimer assays. We show that these D-dimer assays all have a high sensitivity and negative predictive value, but none of the assays reached an NPV of >98% at standard cut-off values. For exclusion of DVT, we therefore recommend combining the D-dimer assay with other non-invasive tests in order to reach failure rates less than 1.0%. The use of D-dimer assays with a very low specificity might not be worthwhile from an economical point of view, as a positive test will necessitate additional testing in the majority of the patients.\\nVenous thromboembolism can be related to malignancy, but routine screening for cancer in every patient with deep venous thrombosis is a matter of debate. We show that high D-dimer concentrations at presentation and during the first days of treatment are indicators of an increased change for overt or occult forms of cancer, especially in patients younger than 60 years.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Language lateralization in schizophrenia'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Schizophrenia is a severe chronic psychiatric illness that affects approximately 1-2% of the populations worldwide. Schizophrenia is characterized by episodes of psychosis, in which patients experience hallucinations (false perceptions) and delusions (false beliefs). Apart from the psychotic episodes, patients frequently have negative symptoms: they become apathic, loose interest in hobbies and friends and lack energy. \\r\\nThe cause of schizophrenia is not clear, though several theories have been proposed. One of these theories states that language lateralization is decreased in schizophrenia. The relative high language activity in the right (non-dominant) hemisphere could be the source of language-related psychotic symptoms, such as the false perception of voices. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis hypothesis is tested in this thesis by applying functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to measure language activity of each hemisphere. \\r\\nLanguage lateralization in right-handed men with schizophrenia was compared to that of healthy right-handed men. The patients had a lower mean degree of language lateralization than the controls. Patients who frequently experienced hallucinations, which were auditory verbal in nature, had lower degrees of language lateralization than patients without prominent hallucinations at the time of scanning. \\r\\nThis finding was replicated in female patients. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn order to investigate whether decreased language lateralization is a result of this severe psychiatric condition or if it is a possible etiological factor a twin study was undertaken. Monozygotic twin pairs from which only one of the twin pair had schizophrenia were compared to healthy monozygotic twin pairs. Language lateralization was found to be decreased in both the affected twin and his/her unaffected twin brother/ sister. This implies that decreased language lateralization is already present before the outbreak of the disease and that it may constitute a genetic risk factor for schizophrenia. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion, some support was found that language lateralization is decreased in schizophrenia and that decreased lateralization may be a risk factor for schizophrenia. However, it remains unclear if decreased lateralization plays a role in the patho-physiological mechanism of psychosis.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Plasminogen activation in cancer'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['The subject of this thesis focusses on the role of the plasminogen activation system in angiogenesis and cancer. The plasminogen activation system regulates fibrinolysis and controls cell migration and invasion by plasmin-mediated matrix proteolysis. Plasmin is formed upon cleavage of the zymogen plasminogen by plasminogen activators, urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA). In contrast to uPA, plasminogen activation by tPA requires a cofactor, such as fibrin. Plasmin cleaves its substrates behind a basic amino-acid (lysine or arginine). Free carboxy-terminal lysines or arginines provide high affinity binding sites for plasminogen and facilitate efficient activation by plasminogen activators. Plasminogen activation can be inhibited by lysine analogues such as epsilon aminocaproic acid (?ACA) or tranexamic acid. Studies with these lysine analogues have indicated the importance of carboxy-terminal lysine residues in cancer and angiogenesis. In chapter 1 we give a literature overview of the plasminogen activation system in cancer. In addition we summarize possible ways to interfere with tumor growth by targeting this system.\\n\\nThrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) is a circulating carboxypeptidase B-type enzyme that specifically cleaves carboxy-terminal lysine or arginine residues from proteins. Removal of carboxy-terminal lysines and arginines from fibrin abrogates efficient plasminogen binding and consequently leads to decreased plasmin formation. Given the importance of the plasminogen activation system in angiogenesis, tumor growth and metastasis, we have studied the role of TAFI in corneal angiogenesis (chapter 2) and subcutaneous tumor growth and experimental- and spontaneous metastasis formation in TAFI-deficient mice (chapter 3). Furthermore, we have determined TAFI antigen and TAFI activity levels in patients with primary and metastasized prostate cancer (chapter 4).\\n\\nWe further investigated the mechanism of action of endostatin (chapter 5). Endostatin is a carboxy-terminal fragment of collagen XIII, and has originally been described as one of the most potent inhibitors of angiogenesis. In animal experiments different forms of endostatin are used. Although the soluble form of endostatin inhibits tumor growth, complete tumor regression has only been observed when using insoluble endostatin. We found that insoluble endostatin, in contrast to soluble endostatin, stimulates plasminogen activation by tPA, induces plasminogen-mediated endothelial cell detachment and matrix degradation and is toxic to neuronal cells (chapter 5,6). These effects were inhibited by carboxypeptidase B treatment indicating an essential role for carboxy-terminal lysines. \\nInsoluble proteins may occur as amorphous aggregates or as highly ordered \\x91amyloid\\x92 deposits. Structure analyses revealed that insoluble endostatin forms amyloid fibers (chapter 6) which was critical for the effects on plasminogen activation and endothelial and neuronal cells (chapter 5,6,7).\\nWe further established that the presence of amyloid fibers is a common feature in other tPA-ligands, including fibrin peptides, islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP, associated with pancreatic ß cell toxicity in type II diabetes) and amyloid ß (associated with Alzheimer\\x92s disease), and responsible for their ability to stimulate tPA-mediated plasminogen activation (chapter 7). To what extent may our observations be of value for the use of endostatin and other antiangiogenic fragments? In chapter 9 we discuss the possible implications of our findings'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Foveal reflection analyzer : on the spectral and directional reflectance of the retina'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['The first part of this thesis was on the development of a new instrument for measurement of light reflected from the retina in a living human eye. The key element is an imaging spectrograph, with its slit placed conjugate to the pupil of the eye. The instrument measures both the spectral and the directional properties of the reflected light. Model analysis of the spectral reflection yields the optical densities of ocular absorbers, e.g., the eye lens, melanin, and the macular pigment. The directional properties of the retinal reflectance provide information on the integrity of the foveal cone photoreceptors. The applications of the instrument concentrate on the fovea: the region of the retina specialized for acute vision. Therefore, the apparatus was coined the \"Foveal Reflection Analyzer\".\\n\\nIn the second part of this thesis, analysis of the spectra obtained with the new instrument allowed us to demonstrate several new aspects of the retinal reflectance. First, we elaborated on spectra for the directionality described with parameter r; a measure for the peakedness of the distribution in the pupil plane. The scattering theory by Marcos et\\xa0al. [J. Opt. Soc. Am. A 15, 2012-2022 (1998)] and Marcos and Burns [J. Opt. Soc. Am. A 16, 995-1004 (1999)] predicts that r versus wavelength can be described by the sum of the waveguide directionality rwg, independent from wavelength, and a contribution proportional to one over wavelength squared, attributed to scattering. The contribution of the latter component gives a measure for the row-to-row cone spacing. Our data for r as a function of wavelength corroborated the scattering theory. The estimations for cone spacing and the waveguide directionality were in agreement with the literature.\\n\\nSecond, we derived a model for the amplitude of the directional reflectance as a function of the wavelength. The directional reflectance was supposed to originate from the outer segments of the photoreceptors. Only two absorbers were considered of significance: the crystalline lens and the macular pigment. Model analysis of spectra obtained from five eyes with a plastic implant lens demonstrated that the source of directional reflectance is spectrally neutral. Data obtained on 39 normal eyes aged 18-64 years allowed us to study the absorption in the natural eye lens as function of age. Our newly proposed model for absorption in the lens comprises two components: a \"young\" template representing the pigment O-b-glucoside of 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HKG), and an \"aged\" template representing the pigments accumulating in the lens with age. The final model was applied to spectra obtained from individual eyes. As expected, the density of the young template decreased with age. Concomitantly, the density of the aged template increased with age. The total optical density of the eye at 420\\xa0nm slightly increased with age. Precise individual estimates for the macular pigment density were obtained. Finally, we observed a decrease of the photoreceptor reflectivity with age, possibly reflecting a degradation of the photoreceptors.\\n\\nIn the final part of this thesis, the first application of the new instrument in a clinical setting is presented. This study included a group of patients with diabetes mellitus. The aim was to assess the integrity of the photoreceptors in the fovea, and to measure the optical density of the macular pigment and the eye lens. The results were compared with those of a group of healthy subjects. We found a strong reduction of the amplitude of the directional reflection in the diabetics group. This indicates changes in the integrity of the foveal cone-photoreceptors. The directionality of the cones was not reduced. Macular pigment was not significantly different in diabetics. Lens density increased at a substantially higher rate in diabetics, compared with the normal age-related increase in the controls. The instrument proved to be a fast and practical test on photoreceptor integrity. Macular pigment could be assessed efficiently and accurately in the patients, their reduced visual acuity presented no problem for the method. The results of this first pilot study warrant the initiation of further clinical studies on a larger scale. For this purpose, our group has recently developed a table-top version of the instrument.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is a clonal myeloproliferative disease characterized by an uncontrolled proliferation and block in differentiation of myeloid committed blood cells in the bone marrow. Despite the lack of mature cells derived from the leukemic clone in the majority of AML patients, AML cells are heterogenous in phenotype and functional ability. AML progenitors capable of initiating the leukemia in immunocompromised mice and generating clonogenic cells after long-term culture in vitro are CD34+, CD38-, HLA-DR- and CD71-. This phenotype is similar to that of normal progenitors with these functional characteristics. In contrast to AML progenitors, normal progenitors express higher levels of CD117 and CD90. Cells with the primitive phenotype represent only a small minority of all AML blasts, but seem uniquely capable of propagating the leukemia, suggesting they are AML stem cells. Existing therapies to treat AML are largely directed against the bulk population of AML cells. The ability to phenotypically distinguish between AML and normal stem cells could be extremely useful to develop purging therapies for transplantation and AML stem cell specific therapies to target minimal residual disease. \\nCD133 is a new stem cell antigen present on normal CD34+ and CD34- hematopoietic cells with in vivo repopulating ability. Although we found a close correlation between CD34 and CD133 expression on AML cells, CD133 is not useful to purify or purge AML stem cells. \\nCD33 is a cell surface marker exclusively expressed on myeloid cells. Because CD33 is absent on normal hematopoietic stem cells, but is expressed on the majority of AML patient samples, CD33 appears to be useful for purging strategies and antibody-targeted therapy. We determined whether CD33 is expressed on AML progenitors with long-term proliferative ability in vitro and in vivo repopulating ability. We demonstrate that, although CD33 is expressed on the majority of AML samples it is absent on AML progenitors with long-term in vitro ability and is absent on some but not all repopulating cells of a substantial number of patients. Therefore, most AML stem cells will be spared by CD33 based therapies.\\nHuman somatic cells have a limited life span and telomeres and telomerase play an important role in the regulation of the lifespan and senescence of human cells. Telomerase is a DNA polymerase that maintains the telomeric ends of chromosomes. Most adult human cells have undetectable telomerase. However, 90% of human cancers including AML, express telomerase to maintain their telomere length. We introduced a dominant negative form of telomerase into a leukemic cell line and primary AML cells. This resulted in an inhibition of the proliferation of AML progenitors in vitro and in vivo suggesting that telomerase inhibition is a promising target to treat AML. \\nNotch receptors influence the cell fates in progenitors of numerous cell types in a wide range of organisms. In humans, four Notch receptors have been identified, Notch1-4. In human hematopoiesis Notch activation results in the maintenance of stem cells and in a block in differentiation. We found higher Notch expression progenitor cells and overexpression of Notch4 results in stem cell maintenance and in a block in myeloid differentiation. In primary AML progenitors Notch receptors are not down-regulated upon differentiation. Notch activation through ligation with Jagged1 ligand resulted in an abnormal proliferation of long-term AML progenitor cells, suggesting that abnormal Notch expression or activation might play a role in AML.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Drug dependence is a major health issue worldwide, which is characterised by its persistence and high rates of relapse. Individual differences exist in the vulnerability for drug dependence after first exposure to drugs of abuse like cocaine. A likely risk factor for drug dependence is the sensitivity to the positive reinforcing effects of drugs of abuse.\\n The studies described in this thesis reveal an important role of µ-opioid receptors in the sensitivity to cocaine reinforcement. Knockout mice, that lack the gene encoding the µ-opioid receptor, were impaired in cocaine self-administration, suggesting that they are less sensitive to the reinforcing effects of cocaine. In contrast, both acute and chronic cocaine-induced locomotor activity were not subjective to changes in absence of µ-opioid receptors. Therefore, µ-opioid receptors appear to have an important and specific role in modulating cocaine reinforcement.\\n Further studies described in this thesis provide insight into the mechanism of µ-opioid receptor mediated modulation of cocaine reinforcement. Cocaine self-administration was associated with pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) expression in the arcuate nucleus, suggesting that POMC and POMC-derived peptides, like the µ-opioid receptor selective peptide â-endorphin, might contribute to cocaine reinforcement. In absence of µ-opioid receptors, increased GABAergic inhibitory input onto dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area was observed. It is proposed that regulation of GABAergic neurotransmission in the VTA contributes to µ-opioid receptor mediated modulation of cocaine reinforcement.\\n Considering the important role of µ-opioid receptors in cocaine reinforcement, variations in µ- opioid receptors might contribute to vulnerability for cocaine dependence. Future studies, both preclinical and clinical, should confirm that variations in µ-opioid receptors indeed contribute to the risk for cocaine dependence. This knowledge may lead to improved strategies in prevention and treatment of drug dependence.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Aberrant regulation of hematopoiesis can lead to severe clinical conditions ranging from myeloproliferative disorder to severe immune deficiencies. It is therefore important to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying these processes. Regulation of maturation during granulopoiesis in vivo is mediated by secretion of specific cytokines and adhesion to stromal cells. The studies described in this thesis have investigated the roles of several transcription factors and intracellular signalling molecules in regulation of eosinophil and neutrophil development. To accomplish this, an ex-vivo differentiation system was utilized, which allowed us to investigate the mechanisms underlying granulocyte differentiation in human cord blood derived CD34+ cells. Retroviral transduction experiments enabled us to ectopically express genes of interest and to determine their role in regulating granulopoiesis. We demonstrate that several transcription factors play a critical role in regulating granulopoiesis in general, including STAT5 and Id2, whereas other transcription factors, such as Id1, appear to play a role in determining specific lineage choices. In addition, we presented evidence that PKB plays a critical role in regulation of cell fate determination. Although these results enhance our knowledge regarding the mechanisms regulating granulopoiesis, further research is critical to understand the precise role of stromal cells in cell fate choices and to understand exactly how PKB activity is regulated and what the specific downstream targets of this kinase are that can regulate cell fate.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Introduction: In orthopaedic surgery the autologous bone graft is often applied. However, harvesting of this material is not without complications. Tissue engineering of bone is a promising alternative. Many authors have shown the proof of the concept and currently the first human studies are performed. However, little is actually known of the technique. Based on the available literature, we set the following study aims:\\n\\n1) To investigate the role of cell viability in autologous bone grafts;\\n2) To investigate the role of cell viability in TE constructs;\\n3) To develop a labeling technique to trace cells used for TE;\\n4) To investigate methods to optimize bone tissue engineering;\\n5) To investigate the applicability of TE in clinically relevant models.\\n\\nMethods: All studies were performed with goat bone or bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC\\x92s). Tissue engineered constructs were made by seeding the cells on several porous ceramic scaffolds. \\n\\nResults\\nAd. 1: \\nWe investigated the role of viability in autologous bone grafts. We observed that osteogenesis was far more advanced in viable transplanted grafts, especially when implanted in the muscles (ectopically). Orthotopically, environmental bone formation probably shaded the osteogenic activity of the grafted cells. Although it is tempting to conclude that cells do survive and make bone after transplantation, this study only permits the conclusion that cell viability has an obvious effect on bone formation. This provides a rationale for cell-based bone tissue engineering.\\nAd. 2: \\nThe rationale for cell-based bone tissue engineering was confirmed in the goat model of ectopic bone formation in TE constructs (in the paraspinal muscles).\\nAd. 3:\\nWe investigated the \"off the shelf\" CM-Dil label and had to conclude this label was only applicable for evaluation at short implantation periods As a next step, we developed a retroviral labeling method based on the surface marker NGFR. We could proof the direct coupling between the goat BMSC\\'s and bone formation. \\nAd 4: \\nWe found an advantage for constructs that were cultured for one week after seeding of the cells. When the constructs were not cultured, which makes the procedure considerably less complicated, bone formation appeared to be feasible as well. We further optimized the TE technique both with respect to the yield of bone and the ease of the procedure. By using another type of scaffold (biphasic calcium phosphate BCP), culture of the constructs appeared not to be advantageous. The method of peroperatively combining cryopreserved cells with the ceramic scaffold considerably reduced the logistics to the level of a standard elective procedure. \\nAd. 5: \\nWe used a bilateral iliac wing CSD model. A moderate effect of tissue engineering could be observed only at the evaluation time of 9 weeks. It is plausible that the scaffold itself was responsible for the absence of an obvious effect. Not because the scaffold is unsuitable, but on the contrary, is that potent that the majority of bone is by conduction/induction.\\n\\nConclusion: Irrespective of the outcome, the studies drastically improved our knowledge on bone tissue engineering. Scientifically, the technique is intriguing and provides the opportunity to improve our knowledge on many aspects of bone formation. The answer to improvement of functionality of the tissue engineered bone may be derived from further fundamental investigations or, as often is the case in medicine, found by serendipity. The final and most important conclusion that can be drawn at the end of this thesis is:\\n\\nCell-based bone tissue engineering has the potential to become an ideal autologous graft substitute.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['For large epidemiological observational studies banks of biological samples are sometimes created. To study specific research hypotheses blood, urine or tissue specimens can be obtained from participants to a study and stored for later analysis in a biological bank.\\r\\nConstantly new biochemical, molecular or genetic laboratory techniques are developed. These allow a large number of (new) etiologic hypotheses to be tested on the stored biological material to investigate interesting associations between an exposure and a disease. The amount of stored biological material however is, in general, limited, in particular for the cases (the persons who develop the disease of interest), when the disease is not so common. Furthermore, with most laboratory techniques biological material is destroyed and cannot be used for another test. To combine the large number of interesting hypotheses with the limited number and amount of biological samples statistical methods are needed that can distinguish between more promising and less promising hypotheses at the expense of as little biological material as possible.\\r\\nSequential statistical methods offer a researcher the possibility to terminate an investigation as soon as sufficient evidence has accumulated to accept the null hypothesis (\"no association between exposure and disease\") or to reject it in favour of the alternative hypothesis (\"an association exists between exposure and disease\"). After each new observation or group of observations the accumulated data are tested. Based on the cumulative test result the study is stopped or more information is obtained. A sequential analysis requires, on average, fewer observations to come to a decision (\"accept the null hypothesis or reject it\") than the corresponding fixed sample size analysis. Sequential methods are thus an efficient way to handle the available data.\\r\\nMatching is used to make cases and controls more comparable by controlling for possible confounding factors. These factors are related to both exposure and disease and may distort the size of the exposure-disease relation. In a case-control study one or more controls can be matched to a case based on the value of the confounding factor. A matched design requires in general less cases and controls than an unmatched design. Matching is thus another way of efficient data handling.\\r\\nThe chapters of this thesis describe various sequential tests that can be applied in matched case-control studies. Sequential tests were developed for continuous and dichotomous exposure variables. (Group) sequential analysis was proposed as an alternative for conditional power to stop a study early for \\'futility\\'. Sequential tests for the analysis of gene-environment interactions in matched case-control studies were developed. In the last chapter three approaches to statistical testing theory and their effects on sequential testing were discussed.  \\r\\nIn general, sequential analysis in matched case-control studies can lead to considerable efficiency gains by saving valuable biological samples, time or money.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The Ancient Complement System: Role in Microbial Clearance,  Lipid Transport and Prevention of Autoimmunity\\n    This study concentrates on the complement system, which is part of the nonspecific or \\x91innate\\x92 immune system. The complement system may be considered a primordial enzyme system that was, before enhancing cytolysis, primarily involved in the enhancement of transportation of \\x91opsonized\\x92 (C3b-laden) particles through the circulation towards eliminatory organs in the human body. \\n    In primates, adherence of opsonized particles to the cellular C3b-receptor (CR1) is called \\x91immune adherence\\x92. Although erythrocytes carry low numbers of CR1s on their surface, their receptors are clustered in such a way that erythrocyte \\x91immune adherence\\x92 is more efficient than on e.g. neutrophils. Because 95% of CR1s in the circulation are erythrocyte-bound, the role of erythrocytes in transport and elimination of microbes, immune complexes and tumor cells is indispensable.\\n    Our studies concerned the investigation of lectin and classical pathway proteins mannose-binding lectin (MBL) and complement factor C4. The prevalence of MBL deficiency in the Dutch population was investigated (chapter 3). The development of a hemolytic MBL assay is described, which may be of great value for the further analysis of MBL and/or MBL-associated protein deficiency (chapter 4). By adapting this functional MBL assay, microorganism-induced MBL activation could be investigated, leading to a new way of looking at MBL-activating potencies of microbes (chapter 5). As Legionella pneumophila was found capable of activating the MBL pathway, the question arose as to what the role of MBL in legionellosis might be (chapter 6).\\n    Complement factor C4 is shared by the lectin and classical complement pathways. Although synthesized mainly in the liver, the thyroid and adrenals also produce C4 transcripts for, as yet, unknown reasons. Possibly, the link between (auto)immunity and endocrine systems can be sought at the level of the diseased organ (chapter 8).\\n    By now, it is clear that the lectin and alternative pathways are the most ancient complement pathways. Possibly, these pathways constitute intimately linked parts of a single pathway, whereas the antibody-dependent \\x91classical\\x92 pathway must have evolved about 450 million years ago, when antibodies developed. Other targets of opsonization by these complement pathways may be lipoproteins and DNA. Apolipoprotein B activates the complement system via the lectin pathway, followed by lipid particle opsonization and immune adherence (chapter 7). Hypothetically, DNA may have been the target of the primitive immune system via MBL binding to pentose sugars. \\n    The complement system does not only play an important role in the immunological and microbiological field but it may be one of the key players in endocrinology and lipidology. Further research needs to be done to prove the hypotheses raised by our results.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['In the present thesis, the link between the genotype of the mouse and the concurrent phenotype is investigated employing sophisticated molecular and cellular techniques combined with in vivo cardiac performance measurements. In chapter 1 we focus on the characteristics of cardiac remodeling following an ischemic event in man. The characteristics of remodeling are thoroughly discussed through the results solely derived from studies in genetically modified mice. Despite the data available, intracellular signaling is still a mystery as we lack the tools to study several pathways simultaneously and maybe even more important the temporal changes in signaling cascade interactions. \\nIn chapter 2 the molecular processes involved in cardiac hypertrophy are discussed. The concept of beneficial and maladaptive pathways is introduced and related to the detrimental transition of hypertrophy towards heart failure.  \\nOpen-chest and closed-chest protocols for in vivo left ventricular pressure-volume measurement are illustrated in chapter 3.We have chosen for closed-chest cardiac function assessment protocol in our ischemia-reperfusion studies, because of better systolic and diastolic performance, normal arterial-ventricular coupling and preservation of myocardial integrity. \\nTo unravel the importance of specific signaling pathways (e.g. MEK1-ERK1/2 and calcineurin-NFAT) in ischemia-reperfusion-induced cell death techniques of transgenesis (e.g. MEK1 and GSK-3B transgenic mice) and gene targeting (e.g. ERK1 homozygous, ERK2 heterozygous and CnAB homozygous knockout mice) have been used. In chapter 4 we analyzed ERK1 homozygous knockout mice, ERK2 heterozygous knockout mice, and transgenic mice with activated MEK1-ERK1/2 signaling in the heart to determine a direct causal relationship between ERK1/2 signaling and cardioprotection. A direct cardioprotective role for ERK signaling in the heart following ischemia-reperfusion injury was demonstrated. In chapter 5 we investigate the role the calcium/calmodulin-activated protein phosphatase calcineurin plays in modulating cardiac apoptosis following acute ischemia-reperfusion injury in the heart. Calcineurin Aß (CnAB) gene targeted mice showed a greater loss of viable myocardium, more apoptosis, and a greater loss in functional performance following ischemia-reperfusion injury when compared to strain-matched wildtype control mice. Increased cell death was associated with a reduction of NFAT activity. \\nThe study presented in chapter 6 was designed to elucidate the role of GSK-3B following ischemia-reperfusion. In GSK-3B transgenic mice, ischemia led to a larger infarct area and subsequent worsened cardiac performance, while post-ischemic hypertrophic remodeling was blunted.\\nIn previous studies activation of both MEK1-ERK1/2 and calcineurin-NFAT signaling pathways were associated with hypertrophic cellular growth. The present thesis proves their involvement in anti-apoptotic protection against ischemia-reperfusion injury. The dualistic role of both resuscitative survival pathways in distinct pathogenic conditions as cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and apoptosis, is a fascinating observation. To further delineate the specific roles of individual survival pathways and investigate their potential use in clinical practice, future research should focus on studying multiple signaling cascades simultaneously and their interplay. A possible option is to cross-breed different genetically modified mice, thereby creating double knockout or knockout/transgenic mice. Another possibility could come from dynamic molecular imaging, through which protein function and interaction could be visualized. The treatment of cardiac ischemia will eventually be improved significantly through new developments in molecular science.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The primary goal of lung cancer therapy is complete eradication of the disease. Surgery remains the most curative modality for non-small cell lung cancer. The goal of surgical treatment is to perform a complete resection. Resectability is closely related to the stage of the disease. \\nThe thesis focuses on patients with T3 and T4 non-small cell lung cancer. T3 tumours comprise a heterogeneous group, including tumours with invasion of the chest wall, mediastinal structures, or diaphragm, Pancoast tumours, tumours with involvement of the main bronchus within 2 cm of the carina, and tumours associated with atelectasis or obstructive pneumonitis of the entire lung. The data presented in this thesis confirm that surgery is the treatment of choice for patients with a T3 tumour. The most important prognostic factor is to perform a complete resection, as an incomplete resection predicts poor survival. Regarding several subgroups of T3 tumours, survival was better for tumours located in the main bronchus, but the difference was not statistically significant. Another important factor regarding survival of resected T3 tumours is the presence of mediastinal lymph node metastases. Similar results have been published for Pancoast tumours, which can be staged as a T3 or T4 tumour, depending on invasion of adjacent structures. Recent results of combination of chemoradiotherapy and surgical resection suggest that this combined modality treatment offers the best survival results for these tumours.\\nCharacterisation of the primary tumour as T4 involves the presence of any of the following: invasion of the mediastinum, heart or great vessels, trachea, oesophagus, vertebral body, or the carina, the presence of a malignant pleural or pericardial effusion or satellite tumour nodule(s) within the same lobe as the primary tumour. The role of surgery for T4 tumours remains unclear due to high hospital mortality rates and few data about long-term survival. The largest experience and the best results for long-term survival are described in patients with T4 tumours invading the carina and trachea. Recently, multimodality treatment has become the recommended therapy for patients with locally advanced T4 tumours. It remains an important issue to demonstrate histopathological downstaging, as patients with persistent N2/N3 disease do not benefit from surgical resection. However, repeat mediastinoscopy does not seem a useful tool for restaging of the mediastinum after induction therapy, as adhesions and fibrosis cause incomplete procedures and false-negative results.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Entrepreneurship is seen as a crucial determinant of economic development. Entrepreneurs recognize and capitalize on opportunities so that a business organization can be created and evolve. The ability and willingness of entrepreneurs to take risks and start new companies, coupled with institutions that support entrepreneurship, has sparked economic growth and job creation. But it is not small firms per se that are the key; it is the relatively small number of fast-growing gazelles that account for the lion s share of net new jobs in small firms. In a quickly changing economy with a premium on innovation, the degree to which the economy is composed of new, rapidly growing firms is said to be indicative of innovative capacity. These enterprises often start in the home region of the entrepreneur, but when they grow they have to reconsider their location. Do they stay in their region of origin or do they move to or start branches in other regions and countries? \\r\\nThe general purpose of this study is to improve our understanding of the dynamics of the spatial organization of evolving enterprises. A critical overview of theories on location and on the development of new enterprises shows that there is indeed a gap to be filled. This gap concerns a life course approach to the analysis of the spatial organization of evolving enterprises, including the role of networks and the role of the entrepreneur. A comprehensive theory of the spatial organization of evolving enterprises is still lacking. There are theories on the growth of new enterprises, but these have no spatial dimension and do not explain their spatial organization. And there are also theories on multinational enterprises, but these mainly focus on large, well-established enterprises. In addition, there are empirical approaches to the location decisions of small firms, but most of them lack a proper theory. To fill this gap we have made use of existing approaches that had not previously been related to research into the spatial organization of evolving enterprises, but which offered promising applications. However, as explained below, the spatial organization of enterprises as such refers to a state, but this state has to be explained by an underlying process. \\r\\nUnderstanding dynamics of the spatial organization of evolving enterprises involves the study of entrepreneurship in context. Although empirical and theoretical issues of this kind of research have been discussed quite intensively, there has been remarkably little discussion about meta-theoretical issues. While it is clear that positivism has died a long time ago that does not mean that we have to embrace the postmodern  anything goes-principle . Our study is based on a   post-positivist   constructive realism. This will be discussed together with other meta-theoretical foundations of research on entrepreneurship in context.\\r\\nTo fulfil the purpose of this study a confrontation between theory and particular empirical settings is considered. An empirical inquiry into the impact of   both inter-organizational and personal - networks on the spatial organization of evolving enterprises, which is essentially about entrepreneurial behaviour, needs a research approach that takes into account cognitive, affective, and behavioural elements. These elements have been investigated in empirical research into the (location) strategies and histories of evolving enterprises in two young - knowledge services, and biomedicals   and two mature industries - shipbuilding, and graphics-media, in contrasting regions (core/urbanized, peripheral/rural).'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The research question of this study is based on a practical problem in nursinghomes. When a patient develops dysphagia, caused by a cerebrovascular accident (CVA or stroke), tubefeeding-treatment (TFT) is an option. There is a great chance the patient does not recover and will be depending on this tretment. From this situation arises the next question. Is it morally justified - when the prognosis is bad or unclear - to withhold TFT to a CVA-patient with dysphagia, in order to prevent that the patient will be dependent on TFT for the rest of his life, and to prevent the problems of withdrawing TFT. \\n\\nFor the justification of this TFT two grounds can be distinguished: (a) justification on the effects of the treatment and (b) justification based on moral principles. This study is founded on the Christian conviction, and the associated moral principles: respect for life, doing well (or beneficence) and (respect for) responsibility.\\nIn general, starting TFT is effective when this treatment results in the recovery of the patient. It is justified to withhold TFT when the treatment doesn\\x92t bring the patient any good. In this case beneficence is the guiding principle.     \\nWhen a doctor starts TFT and - after few weeks - the patient does not recover, the treatment is ineffective. Still the treatment shows one minimal result: it is a life-sustaining treatment. In principle, the doctor can justify the action to withdraw TFT. But as soon as a doctor wants to remove the tube, the risk increases that this decision is not only grounded on the lack of effectiveness of the treatment, but also on the low quality of patient\\x92s life. This justification conflicts with the protection of human life. This vision confirms the hypothesis that when TFT is given for longer time, the moral justification shifts from beneficence to respect for life. It is caused by the differences of both decision-moments: (a) the stability of the patient, (b) TFT shows to be a life-sustaining treatment, and (c) a different judgment about the low quality of patient\\x92s life. Therefore a doctor should be very careful to withdraw TFT without the intention of life-shortening.  \\nThe view that the doctor should be very careful to withdraw TFT (given the \\x91increased risk\\x92 of wrong intentions) implies for the central question of this study that it is not justified to withhold TFT in order to prevent the moral problems of withdrawing TFT. When a doctor judges the problem of \\x91withdrawing TFT\\x92 at the moment of \\x91withholding TFT\\x92, he can not avoid the \\x91increased risk\\x92. In this way the central question of this study is answered.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Energy resolving power of transition-edge X-ray microcalorimeters'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['This thesis describes the development and device physics of an X-ray microcalorimeter. This is a device for measuring the energy of X-rays. The microcalorimeter measures the temperature increase that is the result of the absorption of an X-ray photon. Combined into an array, the microcalorimeter can be used as an imaging spectrometer. The availability of an imaging X-ray spectrometer with a high energy resolving power will have a significant impact in astronomy and material analysis. In astronomy, X-ray spectra provide information about high-energy processes taking place in the universe. In material analysis, the structure and composition of materials can be determined. The work described here is guided by therequirements of an\\r\\ninstrument for XEUS, a future space-based astrophysical observatory. \\r\\nThe microcalorimeter is based on a superconducting-to-normal phase transition edge thermometer (TES). This is a superconductor that is voltage-biased in the very narrow transition from superconducting to resistive behaviour. In the\\r\\ntransition, the electrical resistance is very sensitive to changes in the temperature, making the TES a good temperature to resistance transducer. The resistive element is easily incorporated in an electrical read-out circuit. The energy resolving power of the microcalorimeter is limited by noise. In this thesis, this noise is studied in detail, both in experimental sensors as well as through simulations.\\r\\nThe sensors are fabricated using existing Si3N4 micromachining and thin-film photolithographical techniques. Several sensors with small square absorbers were manufactured and tested. With an operating temperature of 0.1 K, their energy resolution was about 4.5 eV for X-ray photons of 5.9 keV. This is equivalent to a resolving power of 1300. This energy resolution is satisfactory, but not as good as predicted by theory. This discrepancy was investigated and forms the heart of this thesis. The difference between theory and measurement was explained by a combination of two effects:\\r\\nFirstly, because the TES and absorber are seperate parts in the sensor, there can be an exchange of energy between the two. This results in an internal noise component which deteriorates the energy resolution. By changing the sensor geometry, we were able to influence and reduce the spectral density of this noise component. Using a numerical noise simulation, several geometries were evaluated.\\r\\nSecondly, the predicted resolution is based on a small-signal model, which assumes limited excursions over the transition of the TES. For actual X-ray pulses that use a significant part of the dynamic range of the TES, this model was found to be incorrect. The large excursions cause the pulse shape to deviate from the ideal shape as assumed by the small-signal model. Because of this, the small-signal model predicts a better resolution than could actually be measured. Using measured pulse shapes, a more accurate prediction was made, which is in agreement with the measurements. A simple large-signal model was constructed to simulate pulse shapes based on the sensor parameters. With this model, the energy resolution can be described as a function of the size of the excursion over the transition (equivalent to different X-ray photon energy or\\r\\ndevice heat capacity). The model can be used for performance prediction at arbitrary X-ray energies and for improved sensor optimisation.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['This thesis is about methods for electronic structure calculations on molecular systems. The ultimate goal is to construct methods that yield potential energy\\r\\nsurfaces of sufficient accuracy to allow a qualitatively correct description of the\\r\\nchemistry of these systems; i.e. heat of formation, isomerisation barriers,\\r\\nequilibrium geometries, and vibrational spectra. In order to properly calculate\\r\\nthe potential energy surfaces for all these properties a multi-configurational\\r\\nstarting point is essential. This means that all methods that will be discussed are\\r\\nbased on a multi-reference wavefunction where the reference function is\\r\\noptimised using the multi-configurational Hartree-Fock (MCHF) method.\\r\\nBeyond the MCHF method there are various methods to account for the\\r\\ncorrelation energy of a molecule. Not all of these methods are equally suited to\\r\\ncalculating potential energy surfaces. In chapter 1 the basic notions are\\r\\nintroduced and a list of required qualities for a method is compiled. This list\\r\\nincludes size consistency, independence of the orbital representation of the\\r\\nreference wavefunction, efficiency, and others. The methods discussed in this\\r\\nthesis will be checked against these requirements.\\r\\nThe main part of this thesis treats a perturbation method that was first\\r\\nformulated by Møller and Plesset (MP) in 1934. In its original formulation the\\r\\nmethod is applied starting from a single closed shell determinant. It was known\\r\\nthat in this case the method is strictly size consistent. It was known also that the\\r\\nmethod diverges in cases when two states are close in energy. The basic idea at\\r\\nthe start of the work described here was to avoid these divergences by including\\r\\nall nearly degenerate states in the reference function thus generalising the\\r\\nmethod to the multi-reference case. If this would be possible while retaining the\\r\\nsize consistency a very efficient and highly accurate multi-reference Møller-Plesset\\r\\nmethod (MRMP) would be obtained.\\r\\nIn chapter 2 the implementation of this method for a general reference\\r\\nwavefunction is described. Although the test applications yielded encouraging\\r\\nresults, a few results suggested divergences may still show up. In chapter 3 a\\r\\nmethod to detect divergences is proposed and it was applied to suspicious\\r\\nsystems. It is found that the multi-reference perturbation theory may be more\\r\\nstrongly divergent than the single-reference approach. Also, the multi-reference\\r\\nresults were not exactly size consistent. A detailed study of this problem is?118\\r\\ngiven in chapter 4 were it is concluded from theory that the method should be\\r\\nexactly size consistent. In chapter 5 the practical aspects involved in a size\\r\\nconsistent multi-reference perturbation theory are described. The results show\\r\\nthat a size consistent approach can be obtained. The crucial aspects are that the\\r\\nprojection operators to construct the zeroth-order Hamiltonian should each\\r\\nproject onto a subspace of a single excitation level, the orthogonalisation\\r\\nmethod to generate the orthonormal excited states should be highly accurate,\\r\\nand in open-shell calculations applying the unitary group generators twice is not\\r\\nenough to generate all required spin states.\\r\\nPerturbation theory is not the only method that yields size consistent results.\\r\\nAlready in the sixties it was known that some electron pair approximations yield\\r\\nexactly size consistent correlation energies also. In the single reference case it\\r\\nwas shown that the coupled electron-pair approximation (CEPA) could be used\\r\\nto approximate coupled cluster in the singles-doubles configuration space.\\r\\nRuttink et al. have generalised this approach to the multi-reference case\\r\\n(MRCEPA(0)). Although this approach is not exactly size consistent it is the\\r\\nbest alternative to MRMP we have available. For this reason the MRMP results\\r\\nin this thesis are often compared to results obtained with MRCEPA(0).\\r\\nAt the heart of the MRCEPA(0) is the Davidson diagonalisation method that is\\r\\nused to iteratively solve the eigenvalue equations. The efficiency of the\\r\\nMRCEPA depends primarily on the rapid convergence of the Davidson method.\\r\\nEssentially, the Davidson method calculates the best approximation to the\\r\\nwavefunction from a given set of vectors. Through extending this set by one\\r\\nvector (the update vector) in every iteration convergence is guaranteed. The\\r\\nspeed of convergence depends on how appropriate the update vectors are.\\r\\nHowever, Sleijpen and van der Vorst realised that if the method was applied\\r\\nexactly as suggested by Davidson it would never converge. A detailed analysis\\r\\nled to improvements enhancing the speed of convergence. The application of\\r\\nthese improvements in quantum chemistry is discussed in chapter 6.\\r\\nIn chapter 7 the results from the main chapters are checked against the\\r\\nrequirements list compiled in chapter 1. The conclusion is that although some\\r\\nrequirements could be met, none of the methods satisfies all requirements.\\r\\nBecause the alternatives employing a determinantal basis are nearly exhausted it\\r\\nis suggested that future developments should go in other directions, e.g.\\r\\nexplicitly correlated wavefunctions.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Structural studies on B2-glycoprotein I and von Willebrand factor A3 domain'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['The integrity of blood circulation is a prerequisite for life; its malfunctioning is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in developed countries. For that reason the haemostatic system is a critical component of homeostasis. In Chapter I an overview is given of the biophysical and biochemical characterization of two human plasma proteins that serve important functions in haemostasis: ?2-glycoprotein I (?2gpI) and von Willebrand factor (vWf). ?2gpI has a proposed role in clearance of thrombogenic apoptotic cells and in coagulation. Moreover, ?2gpI is the key target of auto-antibodies in the auto-immune disease anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS), resulting in thrombotic complications. ?2gpI binds with its fifth C-terminal short concensus repeat (SCR) domain to anionic lipids. This affinity is increased by complexation of ?2gpI in divalent ?2gpI-antibody complexes, which results in shielding of anionic surfaces that are necessary in coagulation. Binding to anionic lipids is possibly the primary involvement of ?2gpI in coagulation. Multimeric vWf has a key function in the haemostatic system when an arterial vessel wall is damaged. Multi-domain vWf contains the binding site for collagen located in its A3 domain. When an arterial vessel wall is ruptured, binding of the A3 domain to exposed collagen is a first step in haemostasis, that facilitates recruitment of platelets for formation of a blood clot. The function of vWf can be disturbed by quantitative and qualitative alterations of the protein and by non-self compounds that induce spontaneous platelet aggregation. Disturbed vWF function results in bleeding tendencies or thrombotic complications. Structural insights into adhesion of ?2gpI to lipids and of vWf-A3 to collagen are of valuable help in understanding their role in homeostasis and in yielding insight into the molecular origin of, for example, coagulation disorders. \\n\\n?2-Glycoprotein I\\nIn Chapter II we describe the crystal-structure elucidation of ?2gpI from human plasma. The structure is solved at 2.7 Å resolution with the multiple isomorphous replacement method and reveals that ?2gpI has an elongated fish-hook like arrangement of its five globular SCR domains. Half of the fifth domain has a unique face created by a six-residue insertion and a 19-residue C-terminal extension, together with some rearrangement of parts of the SCR-like core. Based on this structure and on biochemical data we propose a model for adhesion to anionic lipids. A large patch of 14 cationic residues provides favorable electrostatic interactions with anionic surfaces, and an exposed membrane-insertion loop containing a typical Trp-Lys sequence yields specificity for lipids. The lipid-adhesion site is located at the tip and outer curve of the ?2gpI fish-hook. From the crystal structure we infer that in the lipid-bound state, domains one to four point away from the lipid layer. Domains three and four are partly shielded for protein-protein interactions by the four N-glycans attached to these domains. Domains one and two are fully exposed and may provide binding sites in apoptosis, APS and coagulation. In Chapter III we address ?2gpI-protein complex formation in solution using gel-filtration chromatography. ?2gpI forms a stable complex with IgG 22F6 which has properties common to auto-antibodies that are active in APS. This indicates that lipid adhesion is not always a prerequisite for formation of active ?2gpI-antibody complexes. ?2gpI does not form complexes in solution with protein C and protein S which are anticoagulants. Complex formation between protein S and its inhibitor C4B binding protein lowers the concentration of free protein S, which results in inhibition of the anticoagulant function of protein S. The complex of protein S and C4B binding protein remains stable, even in the presence of ?2gpI. Therefore, our experiments do not reveal further evidence that supports an anticoagulant function of ?2gpI by maintaining the level of free protein S. With our binding experiments we cannot establish previously reported high-affinity complexation between ?2gpI and calmodulin. Stable complexes putatively only form in vivo when ?2gpI is bound to lipids. In Chapter IV we describe structural differences between intact ?2gpI and an isoform of ?2gpI (denoted ?2gpI *1) that has lost its ability to adhere to anionic lipids and that is present in plasma during oxidative stress. With gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and thin-layer chromatography we show that ?2gpI *1 has bound phosphatidyl-choline (PC) or choline plasmalogen, and, to a lesser extent, sphingomyelin. The crystal structure at 3.0 Å resolution of ?2gpI *1 indicates a binding pocket for a glycerophosphorylcholine moiety located within the adhesion site for anionic lipids. The choline moiety is buried deeply inside the pocket and is surrounded by an anionic residue and two aromatic residues; these are aspects common to several PC-binding proteins. With C-terminal sequencing, carbohydrate analysis and mass spectrometry we show that, neither enzymatic cleavage at Ala314-Phe315, nor mutation Trp316Ser, cleavage of sialic acid residues, or differences in N-glycan content, account for the observed difference in lipid-adhesive properties of ?2gpI *1. Therefore, specific binding of a neutral lipid seems to be fully responsible for blocking adhesion to anionic membranes. Based on these findings we discuss a possible role for ?2gpI *1 in defense mechanisms during oxidative stress. The crystal structure of ?2gpI *1, together with the structures of ?2gpI, which was partially cleaved at Lys317-Thr318 (Ref. 250), and of intact ?2gpI251, also provides new insights that contribute to a more detailed anionic lipid-adhesion model. In the Appendix to Chapter IV we address recently discerned specific structural radiation damage of proteins upon exposure of crystals to very intense X-ray beams of a third-generation synchrotron. We describe a new method for refinement of partially broken disulfide bonds which appear to be present in ?2gpI *1. Effects of specific structural radiation damage include complete cleavage of the carboxyl group of one Glu residue and partial cleavage of all eleven disulfide bonds, observed in the most severely affected crystal of ?2gpI *1. After refinement differences among disulfide bonds in position of the S?-atom and in electron density accounting for the partially broken bonds suggest that solvent-exposed bonds are more susceptible to radiation than buried bonds. Comparison of the severely affected structure of ?2gpI *1 with that of virtually not damaged ?2gpI *1 (Chapter IV) shows that specific structural radiation damage is localized to acidic residues and cystines. No changes in the global conformation of ?2gpI *1 are observed. This implies that the structural implications presented in Chapter IV are not compromised by radiation damage.\\n\\n Von Willebrand factor A3-domain\\nIn Chapter V we describe the crystal-structure determination of the vWf (Se-Met) A3-domain, in its complex with a Fab fragment of antibody RU5, which inhibits binding of vWf to collagen. With this structure we aimed at locating the collagen-binding site in the A3 domain of vWf. The structure is solved at 2.0 Å resolution by molecular replacement using the anomalous signal of the seleno methionines. The epitope of RU5 involves residues that are part of an ?-helix and three solvent-exposed loops, located at the \\x91bottom\\x92 side of A3. Comparison with other structures of A3 shows that RU5 binding does not induce long-range conformational changes. Instead, RU5 most likely blocks collagen binding by steric hindrance, which implies that the collagen-binding site is located at or close to the epitope of RU5 near the bottom side of A3. Surprisingly, the collagen-binding site of vWf-A3 is located distant from the top face of the domain where collagen-binding sites are found in homologous integrin I-domains. Apparently, vWf-A3 and integrin I-domains bind collagen in fundamentally different ways. The structure of A3-RU5 provides an excellent starting point for further exploration of the collagen-binding site by means of site-directed mutagenesis.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The phosphatidylcholine transfer protein (PC-TP) has been studied for over 30 years now.\\r\\nDespite extensive research concerning the biochemical, biophysical and structural properties of PC-TP, the function of this protein is still elusive. We have studied in vitro the folding and the mechanism of PC extraction from membranes. In vivo, we have assessed previously postulated and novel physiological functions of PC-TP by localization studies in various cell lines and by examining lipid metabolism in cells overexpressing PC-TP and Pc-tp null mice. PC proved to be indispensable for the folding of PC-TP as shown by refolding from inclusion bodies. By incubation of PC-TP with microsomes it was confirmed that PC-TP has the highest affinity for PC species with a C16:0 on the sn-1 and a polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) on the sn-2 position. Using electrospray time-of-flight mass spectrometry we established that these complexes are less stable than the PC-TP/C18:0/PUFA-PC complexes. We propose that enhanced take-up and release rates eventually accelerate the transfer of especially C16:0/PUFA-PC.\\r\\nPC-TP is evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm of foetal bovine heart endothelial cells, human umbilical vein endothelial cells, HepG2 cells and NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts. As measured by fluorescence recovery after bleaching, PC-TP was found to be highly mobile throughout the cell. After the addition of peroxisome proliferators, PC-TP relocated to mitochondria in endothelial cells within 5 min. This process is probably mediated by phosphorylation of Ser110 present in the sole putative PKC phosphorylation site of PC-TP. Pc-tp null mice were generated to study the a number of previously proposed functions for the PC-TP, such as a role in bile formation, lung surfactant production and the facilitation of enzymatic reactions involving PC synthesis or breakdown. Remarkably, these mice were normal and had no defect in any of the postulated PC-TP functions analyzed. However, the body weight of the Pc-tp (-/-) mice was 15% higher than that of Pc-tp (+/+) mice after six months on a regular diet. By challenging these mice with diets containing clofibrate and phytol for a period of three weeks, we established a clear connection between PC-TP and these peroxisomal proliferators. PC-TP levels increased up to 7.0-fold in Pc-tp (+/+) mice, leading to a reduction of total triglyceride and phospholipid levels in blood plasma. These effects were absent in the Pc-tp (-/-) mice. It is clear that the physiological function of PC-TP is related to the effects of peroxisome proliferators on lipid metabolism in the body. Since PC-TP relocates to mitochondria, it is inevitable to focus our attention to this organelle. We think that the main target of PC-TP is the â-oxidation of fatty acids. At an influx of an excess of fatty acids, PC-TP relocates to mitochondria and stimulates the â-oxidation. At the same time, PC-TP is upregulated via its PPAR-alpha responsive element. The next time an excess of fatty acids is presented to the cell, the cell can cope more effectively with these lipids.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Marijuana is an extract of the Cannabis sativa and is the most used illegal drug in the world. Public debate centres upon the possible legalization of marijuana for recreational and therapeutic uses. DELTA-exp.9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive compound in marijuana, exerts its action by binding to G-protein-coupled membrane receptors, i.e. the cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptors. The biochemical and pharmacological actions of THC are mimicked by an endogenous lipid termed anandamide [N-arachidonoylethanolamine,5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z-eicosatetraenoyl-N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-amine]. Together with 2-arachidonoylglycerol, anandamide represents a class of endogenous ligands for CB receptors, i.e. the endocannabinoids. The CB receptors, endocannabinoids and proteins for theid biosynthesis and inactivation constitute the endocannabinoid system. The am of the research described in this thesis was to study a) the metabolism of anandamide in human cells and brain tissue, b) the interaction of its oxygenated metabolites with the proteins of the endocannabinoid system, and c) the role of the endocannabinoid system in in vivo neurodegeneration. \\nnchapter 2 of this thesis, we have shown that the life span of anandamide in human brain and cells in culture is limited by a rapid inactivation process consisting of two steps, i.e. a translocation into the cell via a transporter protein, followed by a cleavage by the enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase [FAAH] (Maccarrone et al., J. Biol. Chem., 1998, 273, 32332-32339). Endocannabinoids are not only inactivated via FAAH, but are also oxygenated by other enzymes such as lipoxygenases. In chapter 3, we have described the synthesis of various oxygenated metabolites of anandamide and 2-AG and characterized their cannabinoid properties (Van der Stelt et al., J. Med. Chem., 2002, 45, 3709-3720) The oxygenated metabolites were shown to competitively inhibit FAAH. Furthermore, depending on the position of the hydroxyl group in the metabolites, they were able to selectively bind to the CB1 or CB2 receptor. The metabolites did not interfere with anandamide uptake into the cell. These results indicate that small changes in the chemical structure of anandamide can lead to the generation of novel compounds which can specifically interact with each of the proteins of the endogenous cannabinoid system. With Molecular Dynamics simulations we have tried to identify the essential structural elements of anandamide, which are necessary for the interaction with the CB1 receptor.  \\nThe endocannabinoid system is implicated in the regulation of various processes, such as learning, memory, pain and appetite. Its involvement in pathophysiological conditions is less clear, but we have shown in chapters 4, 5 and 6 that THC and anandamide can protect rat brain against neurodegenerative insults in vivo (Van der Stelt et al., J. of Neurosci., 2001, 21, 8765-8771; Van der Stelt et al., J. of Neurosci., 2001, 21, 6475-6479; Van der Stelt et al., Mol. Neurobiol., 2002, in press). We demonstrated that THC and anandamide could significantly reduce the volume of cytotoxic edema in neonatal rats in the acute phase after the intrastriatal injection with the Na+/K+-ATPase inhibitor ouabain. The effect of THC was antagonized by blocking the CB1 receptor with SR141716A, whereas the reduction in cellular swelling by anandamide was insensitive to this CB1 receptor antagonist. After seven days the infarct volume in THC- and anandamide-treated rats was ~40% and ~64%, respectively, smaller compared to control animals. When assessed at this time point, the neuroprotective actions of both anandamide and THC were abolished by SR141716A. A CB1-receptor mediated reduction in calcium influx and a reduced glutamate release are thought to be responsible for the neuroprotection in the hippocampus, striatum and cortex. In summary, the results reported in this thesis indicate that agonists of CB1 receptors might be useful to enhance the neurological outcome after acute brain damage. If the extent of neuronal damage is not too large, inhibitors of endocannabinoid clearance may prove to be suitable leads for drug development, because they have probably limited side effects, e.g. psychotropic activity'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['In a human body, the behaviour of each cell is controlled by signals like hormones or growth factors. A cell receives such messages by means of specific receptors. These transmit the messages to other proteins in the cell and so on. Such cascades control for example the pattern of active genes or metabolic responses. In this way, proliferation, differentiation, growth and cell death are tightly regulated. The complex of biochemical reactions that occurs in the cell upon signals is called signal transduction.\\r\\nMembers of the Ras-like small GTPases protein family function as molecular switches in signalling pathways. Activating signals induce the GTP-bound form of Ras proteins. In this conformation these proteins pass the signals on to other proteins. Hydrolysis of GTP returns them into the inactive, GDP-bound version and signalling is terminated. Certain mutations in the prototype family member Ras are known which render the protein continuously active. This contributes to oncogenic transformation. The function of the family members Rap1 and Ral is largely unknown. However, they are abundant and rapidly activated upon a variety of signals in platelets. This suggests these GTPases participate in signalling that controls platelet functions. Upon activation, platelets change their shape and concomitantly start sticking to each other (adhesion) by activation of adhesion molecules (integrins). This results in the formation of a blood clot which stops bleeding. Activation under inproper conditions may result in thrombosis, heart or brain infarct. Knowledge and insight with respect to signal transduction is thus required to understand platelet behaviour (and cells in general) under normal and pathological circumstances.\\r\\nIn this thesis, the focus has been on how Ras-like small GTPases are involved in signalling pathways as they occur in platelets. In chapter 1 the Ras proteins and their behaviour and function in blood platelets are discussed. In chapter 2 the calcium-induced Ras-independent Ral activation mechanism in platelets is studied. This research describes the identification and characterization of the Ral-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor RalGEF2. In chapter 3, new insight is provided on the role of Rap1 in integrin-mediated cell adhesion. Rap1 is required for ?1 and ?2 integrin-mediated adhesion induced by Mn2+- or integrin activating antibodies. Treatment with Mn2+ or the activating antibodies did not induce Rap1 activation. Rap1 may fulfil a facilitating function. In chapter 4 the proposed Rap1 function in cAMP-induced PKA-independent elevation of the intracellular calcium concentration is investigated in megakaryocytes. Also in platelets Rap1 has been connected with the regulation of intracellular calcium concentration. However, no evidence was found for the involvement of Rap1 in this process. The experiments described in chapter 5 show Rap1 activation in a diversity of human blood cell lines representing megakaryocytes, monocytes, B and T lymphocytes as the consequence of shear stress. Moreover, Rap1 activity was required for ?IIb?3-mediated adhesion of human megakaryocytes. These findings suggest a connection between shear stress, Rap1 and integrin regulation, but also link Rap1 with the most important platelet integrin. Proper control of this integrin is inevitable for the correct functioning of blood platelets. This connects Rap1 with one of the most elementary processes in platelet activation.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['A target for protein oxidation by reactive oxygen species (ROS) is tyrosine, which may form the age- and/or disease-related biomarkers dityrosine, chlorotyrosine and nitrotyrosine. It was already recognized that immunochemical assays should facilitate studies on the role of oxidative stress in aging and chronic disease and simplify the evaluation of therapeutic approaches. This thesis describes a contribution to the field of measuring protein oxidation by introducing and utilising a novel oxidation sensitive probe. Upon oxidation the fluorescein-labelled tyramine (hence called TyrFluo) may couple to oxidized proteins carrying a tyrosyl radical by forming a dityrosine bond. Exposure of the cells to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the presence of either TyrFluo or (the acetylated cellmembrane permeable) acTyrFluo gave a cellular labelling characteristic for each probe (immunodetection was performed with an HRP-conjugated polyclonal antibody against the fluorescein moiety) independent of the abundance of a particular protein. In order to identify those intracellular proteins that are most susceptible to oxidation by H2O2 we have used acTyrFluo to label proteins in normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF). 2D-PAGE and subsequent Western-blotting were performed on a mixed sample of acTyrFluo-labelled and 35S-methionine-labelled proteins of NHDF. The identification of TyrFluo-labelled proteins was achieved by matching the obtained immunoblot and the autoradiogram to our reference database of the human MRC-5 fibroblasts. This revealed that the labelled proteins were associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER; i.e. BiP/GRP78, calnexin, GRP94, PDI, and GRP58/Erp57). In agreement, fluorescence microscopy showed a co-localization of the acTyrFluo-labelled proteins with the KDEL-receptor ERD2 on the ER membrane. Since H2O2 is a weak oxidant we infer that it must be converted first into a hydroxyl radical (OH.) in the ER (possibly. by a Fenton reaction using transition metal ions available in the ER) for proteins and acTyrFluo to become oxidized. In addition, by altering the anti-oxidative capacities of the cells (e.g. GSH content) the extent of protein labelling could be modulated. To investigate whether ER-related protein folding/maturation is impaired after subjecting cells to oxidative stress the maturation of a [35S]-methionine labelled model protein, the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLr), was followed in pulse-chase experiments under oxidative conditions. Under the same conditions the ratio of GSH versus GSSG was measured and related to the degree of maturation of the LDLr. The velocity of LDLr-maturation was reduced or even abolished in an H2O2-dependent manner. This impairment may result from oxidized folding proteins, sulfhydryls of LDLr, glycosylating enzymes in the ER and/or Golgi, or of eradicated vesicular transport towards the Golgi complex. However, when cells were allowed to recover after the oxidation maturation could be restored. This restoration depended protein synthesis, since blocking of translation by cycloheximide prevented restoration of maturation. In addition, the low GSH/GSSG balance could not be restored during this recovery period. This impaired maturation cannot be put on the account of the ER solely. The transport towards the Golgi complex may also be reduced dramatically, after the H2O2 treatment. The \\'free radical theory of aging\\' describes the age-related accumulation of radical-induced damage to biomolecules and has been extended to the oxidative \"garbage catastrophe theory\". According to this theory, aging may derive from imperfect clearance of oxidatively damaged, relatively indigestible material, the accumulation of which further hinders cellular catabolic and anabolic functions and mainly affects postmitotic non-proliferating cells. Damage to the ER, and its subsequent impaired functionality may be involved in the process of aging. There are several phenomena that suggest its involvement. The contribution to the age-related accumulation of damaged protein as a consequence of the oxidation of ER resident proteins is discussed.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Structural studies of two outer membrane proteins: OmpT from Escherichia coli and NspA from Neisseria meningitidis'],\n",
       "  'Description': [\"This Thesis describes the three-dimensional structures of two outer membrane proteins (OMPs), OmpT and NspA, from two pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria. These structures reveal information about the functioning of these proteins and can potentially be used for the design of antimicrobial drugs or vaccines, since they are exposed to the outside of the bacterium. \\r\\nOmpT is present in Escherichia coli, a bacterium that is commensally present in the intestines, and which is the main cause of urinary tract disease. Homologues of OmpT, called omptins, are found in for example Yersinia pestis and Salmonella typhimurium. Omptins are proteases that can cleave extracellular proteins between two consecutive basic amino acids. They are implicated in pathogenicity of several bacteria, since they can cleave plaminogen, which results in fibrinolysis and subsequently the spread of the bacteria. Furthermore, OmpT inactivates defensins, antimicrobial compounds excreted by the epithelial cells of the urinary tract. OmpT had been classified as a serine protease (involving a Ser-His-Asp triad). This classification is, however, controversial. Indeed, site directed mutagenesis studies showed that mutation of Ser99 and His212 led to a significant reduction of catalytic activity. In contrast, commonly used serine protease inhibitors fail to inhibit OmpT activity. Furthermore, OmpT's activity dependent is on the presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a molecule in the outer membrane. To learn more about OmpT's catalytic mechanism and about its LPS dependence, we solved the crystal structure of OmpT (described in chapter 2). The structure reveals a very long ten-stranded b-barrel, with the putative active site in a large cleft at the extracellular extremity. Surprisingly, the earlier identified active site serine and histidine are very far (~9 Å) apart, which questions their involvement in the same catalytic triad. Since, no unambiguous identification of the active site could be made, we investigated the roles of all acidic residues in activity (described in chapter 3). Three acidic residues (Asp83, Asp85 and Asp210) like His212 turned out to be essential for catalysis. Asp210 forms a couple with His212 on one side of the active site that faces the Asp83-Asp85 couple on the other side. We propose that these four residues constitute a catalytic site, which has not been observed in proteases before. Based on this, we propose a novel catalytic mechanism, which involves the activation of a water molecule by the His-Asp couple, similar to the activation of the serine in serine proteases. Furthermore, we propose that the Asp-Asp couple is involved in stabilization of the oxyanion, similar to which is proposed for aspartic proteases. We solved the crystal structure of OmpT in complex with an inhibitor, zinc (described in chapter 4). Although the zinc binding sites are not very specific, this structure does supports our hypothesis on the catalytic site. Also based on the structure of OmpT, and that of another OMP in complex with LPS, we identified an LPS-binding site in OmpT. Based on the location of this site, we conclude that LPS must have an indirect effect on catalysis, for example by inducing a slight conformational change. \\r\\nNspA of Neisseria meningitidis, the main cause of life-threatening meningitis, has been found to be well-conserved and to elicit bactericidal and protective antibodies in mice. These findings makes NspA a very attractive vaccine candidate. We solved the crystal structure of NpsA (described in chapter 5) in order to know the exact three-dimensional conformation of the loop (loop 3) against which the antibodies are directed. This conformation can form the basis for the design of cyclic peptides that adopt this conformation. These peptides may be used as vaccine against Neisseria meningitidis. The structure of NspA furthermore reveals a hydrophobic cleft with a detergent molecule bound. This might be related to the yet unknown function of NspA. \\r\\nIn conclusion, the structure NspA can be used as a basis for the design of a vaccine, and the structure of OmpT can form a basis for antimicrobial drug design.\"],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Understanding the molecular and functional interactions among macromolecular complexes, as well as their changes associated with time, cell type or disease state will be invaluable for human health, and will have direct implications, for example, in pharmaceutical research to identify and select potential targets, and design efficient and specific drugs. Structural studies of macromolecular complexes, however, suffer from some limitations, especially in the case of weak and transient complexes. New and complementary methodologies, such as docking, have therefore been developed. The current computational approaches, however, also suffer from limitations and new developments and improvements are needed.\\r\\nThis thesis introduces a new docking approach in which the docking of two macromolecules is driven by biophysical and/or biochemical information and furthermore describes structural studies on the UbcH5B-CNOT4 complex involved in the ubiquitination pathway.\\r\\nHADDOCK is a new docking approach that is based on biophysical and/or biochemical information. This information, derived for example from NMR chemical shift perturbation or site-directed mutagenesis experiments, is converted into highly ambiguous intermolecular distance restraints that are directly used to drive the docking process. The docking protocol allows for side chains and backbone flexibility at the interface and the solutions are scored according to an intermolecular energy term. The method was successfully tested on three complexes. \\r\\nThe solution NMR structure of UbcH5B, an E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme has been solved. NMR relaxation measurements are performed on UbcH5B. They show limited motions for the major part of the protein backbone. We compare the structure of UbcH5B with other E2 structures, and the global fold of all E2s is very similar. Some differences are, however, observed and correlate well with the dynamical properties of E2s. The position and orientation of the N-terminal a-helix as compared to the core of the protein differ in the various structures. This difference may be determinant in E3 ubiquitin ligase binding and recognition. Furthermore, a highly conserved asparagine residue was shown to be important for the ubiquitin transfer. In crystal structures, this asparagine points away from the active site cysteine. Structure of UbcH5B shows that in solution, this asparagine is in close proximity to the active site cysteine, in a conformation suitable for its catalytic role.\\r\\nHADDOCK is then used to generate a structural model of the UbcH5B-CNOT4 complex. CNOT4 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that is part of the CCR4-NOT complex involved in transcription repression. The residues of the CNOT4 RING domain important for the interaction with UbcH5B were previously reported. Here, the residues of UbcH5B important for the binding to CNOT4 RING are identified from NMR chemical shift perturbation experiments. These data are used to generate a structural model of the UbcH5B-CNOT4 complex. Two sets of solutions are, however, obtained that can not be discriminated. Mutagenesis experiments are performed and identify charged residues of UbcH5B (Lys63) and of CNOT4 (Glu49) involved in an electrostatic interaction. Once this information is included in the docking, a unique set of solutions is obtained. The structural model of the UbcH5B-CNOT4 complex is compared with the X-ray structure of the homologous UbcH7-c-Cbl complex and significant differences at specific residues give structural insights into the mechanisms of the E2-E3 specificity.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The convenient synthesis of a large set of (multiple) CP-PAH by Flash Vacuum Thermolysis (FVT), which have all been identified in combustion exhausts, allows their systematic assessment for mutagenicity in the bacterial mutagenicity assay (Ames-assay, TA98±S9-mix). Consequently, the physico-chemical characterization (1H and 13C NMR, cyclic voltammetry, etc.) is carried out to elucidate structure-activity relationships and to explain the high activity exhibited by some CP-PAH, on one hand, and the inactivity of others, on the other hand. To gain further insight in the mechanisms for positive mutagenicity response in the presence and in the absence of the exogenous metabolic activation mixture (± S9-mix), dihydro-CP-PAH derivatives are synthesised and assayed for mutagenic activity. Hence, the importance of the olefinic bond in the five-membered rings can be evaluated. Furthermore, the corresponding epoxides at the cyclopenta moieties are proposed as the ultimate mutagenic active forms of CP-PAH in the presence of the metabolic activation mixture. Their synthesis permits the evaluation of their contribution to the mutagenic activity or inactivity of the corresponding parent CP-PAH. In addition, FVT-pyrolysates are considered as partial mimics of combustion exhausts. Moreover, the results also demonstrate that the mutagenic activity of mixtures containing exclusively (CP)-PAH cannot be accounted for by the addition of the individual contributions of the constituents. However, in practice for general genotoxic potency screening of complex combustion mixtures, still only the 16 PAH listed by the US-EPA are generally taken into consideration and the global genotoxicity is commonly reported as equivalent to that exerted by benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P). The results presented in this Ph.D. thesis show that the assumption of only additive processes among the combustion mixture constituents is incorrect and cannot be maintained. Moreover, other compounds that are more active that B[a]P are shown to greatly contribute to the global genotoxicity of the mixture. Semi-empirical AM1 calculations (MOPAC) of the proposed ultimate mutagenic active forms, i.e. epoxides and mono hydroxy-carbocations at the cyclopenta moieties, are employed to support the experimental results. \\nIn Chapter I a general introduction concerning the sources, environmental distribution, physico-chemical and genotoxic properties of CP-PAH is presented. The FVT method is also described. \\nIn Chapter II the bacterial mutagenicity some mono-CP-PAH is re-evaluated and compared to that exerted by their dihydro-derivatives and epoxide. The results are rationalized by semi-empirical AM1 calculations.\\n In Chapter III, the bacterial mutagenic activity of the three isomeric dicyclopenta-fused pyrene congeners is reported. Their mutagenic potency is markedly affected by the number and the topology of the cyclopenta moieties. The order in mutagenic potency can be explained by semi-empirical AM1 calculations. Furthermore, dicyclopenta[cd,fg]-  and diyclopenta[cd,mn]pyrene are identified as novel contributors to the direct-acting mutagenic activity found in the non-polar fraction of combustion exhausts. \\nChapter IV reports the synthesis and assessment for bacterial mutagenicity of the di-epoxides derived from the three isomeric dicyclopenta-fused pyrene congeners. All epoxides exert direct-acting mutagenicity response and high toxicity, which confirms their role as ultimate mutagenic active forms. \\nChapter V reports the global mutagenic activity exerted by FVT-pyrolysates of the dicyclopenta-fused pyrene congeners. \\nIn Chapter VI the bacterial mutagenic activity of the fluoranthene derivatives is determined. An FVT-pyrolysate containing all derivatives is also evaluated for mutagenic activity. \\nIn Chapter VII the experimental total 1H and 13C NMR assignments of the dicyclopenta-fused pyrene congeners are described and compared to those obtained by ab initio calculations using the CTOCD-PZ2 method. \\nThis thesis concludes with a Summary and an Outlook and Perspectives sections. Furthermore, a summary in Dutch (Samenvatting) and in Spanish (Resumen) are also provided.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['To eradicate or control the spread of infectious diseases, knowledge on the spread of the infection between (groups of) animals is necessary. Models can include such information and can subsequently be used to observe the efficacy of various control measures in fighting the infection. However, the availability of information and data to build and quantify these models is essential for applying such models in real life. In this thesis, models on the spread of infectious diseases in animals are always combined with data concerning the host, the infectious agent, their interactions and often also case data from epidemic or endemic disease situations. To do so, various infections that are present in the Netherlands are discussed.\\r\\nWe show that for Phocine Distemper Virus (PDV) the data of the epidemic in 1988 show that clustering of animals has a strong influence on the transmission and survival of the animals. A previously applied model to analyse the seal situation did not fit the data very well. A model that incorporates the clustering of the animals on sand banks gave a better fit. Due to their clustering, the death rate was higher than could be expected from the first model.\\r\\nTo control and eradicate Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis (IBR) it is known that the persistence of the infection in previously infected animals may cause a delay in eradication. We have quantified the probability for such a virus to reactivate in the field, and combined that with a model that calculates the expected time to extinction. Thus, control measures in the eradication process can easily be compared for efficacy and a time frame can be defined.\\r\\nThe control of BSE was an important issue in the last decade, but due to limited data, exact advice was difficult to find. By quantifying the transmission parameters, the various control measures can be compared for efficacy. Now that more information is available concerning risks for humans and cattle, optimisation of the surveillance and control can be introduced based on such models. The age distribution of BSE cases offers information on the efficacy of BSE control in the past, but also concerning the prevalence of the infection in the future. Risk assessment and modelling are especially important for countries that would like to prove the absence of BSE in their country.\\r\\nMonitoring of an animal disease situation may have many purposes, for instance to prove freedom from infection for a certain farm or country. In the last chapter of the thesis, we give an opening for extended modelling to quantify the risk of missing a new outbreak in a country that has the Free from disease status. An integrated approach of transmission models that specifically includes the frequency of sampling over time enables us to calculate the probability that an epidemic escapes from detection'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Less invasive surgical treatment of traumatic thoracolumbar fractures.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this thesis various strategies were employed to evaluate the posibilities of reducing the invasiveness of the surgical treatment of traumatic thoracolumbar fractures. A systematic review of the literature suggested that adequate immobilization (as opposed to rigid fixation) of the fractured spine will, in the end lead, to good functional results regardless of the technique used. Previous work demonstrated that insufficient anterior column support can lead to (late onset) kyphosis, mechanical instability, pain and neurological deficit. In a human cadaveric thoracolumbar burst fracture study we demonstrated the feasibility and relative safety of adding balloon vertebroplasty with calcium phosphate cement as a means of reinforcing the anterior column, to the regular treatment of pedicle screw instrumentation. By using a new imaging modality (3D rotational X-ray imaging) we were also able to demonstrate the usefulness and safety of balloon vertebroplasty in fractures where damage to the longitudinal ligaments can be expected. Furthermore, we were able to validate this imaging technique by quantitatively comparing reconstructed (3D) images with corresponding anatomical sections. A high accuracy in displaying the spinal anatomy was found with low interobserver and intraobserver differences. The histological and thermal effects of injecting polymethyl methacrylate and calcium phosphate cement, in artificially created defects in the vertebral body of the goat spine, were investigated. No signs of degeneration to the surrounding tissues could be detected six weeks and six months after surgery and the temperature elevation caused by polymerization of the polymethyl methacrylate cement was not found to reach critical levels. A clinical trial was performed in which twenty patients with traumatic thoracolumbar (burst) fractures but without neurological deficit were included. Balloon vertebroplasty with calcium phosphate cement was performed after internal reduction and fixation with pedicle screw instrumentation. It was found that a significant reduction of the endplate fracture could be achieved after the experimental procedure. Leakage of cement was observed in some patients but did not lead to clinically relevant conditions. The follow-up of the patients was too short to draw solid conclusions yet but the feasibility of the experimental procedure was demonstrated. A randomized controlled clinical trial is currently under consideration. In another human cadaveric study, we demonstrated the feasibility of percutaneous treatment of traumatic fractures by combining balloon vertebroplasty with reduction and fixation using the AO external spine fixator. The external fixator was removed after curing of the cement (typically within 24 hours) and biomechanical tests were performed. It was found that a significant reduction of the fractured endplate could be achieved and at least 60% of the reduced height remained after loading the treated fractures with the maximum values that are sustained during in vivo conditions. This percutaneous treatment could be performed using six small stabwounds instead of a midline incision with the associated soft tissue damage. In the last chapter a device that can be inserted percutaneously, is proposed that could be used as standalone reduction/fixation device for the treatment of traumatic thoracolumbar fractures. This device is currently in the prototype stage and has already undergone some human cadaveric testing.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The aim of this thesis was to address pitfalls and concerns of the diagnostic evaluation of nonpalpable breast lesions, in an attempt to further improve preoperative diagnostic assessment, as well as surgical strategies of nonpalpable breast lesions. Chapter 1 presents an overview of current methods in preoperative diagnostic assessment and treatment of nonpalpable breast lesions. \\r\\nResults of stereotactic large-core needle biopsy (SLCNB) in current practice (2000-2002) are described and compared to results of the controlled study setting during COBRA (COre Biopsy after RAdiological localisation; 1997-2000) in chapter 2. Data on all (n=955) patients scheduled to undergo SLCNB in current practice was assembled. At follow-up of women with benign diagnoses at SLCNB who no longer needed to undergo surgical excision, we found that no malignancies were missed. The follow-up was, however, limited (mean, 20.0 months; 5.8-34.0). 96% of patients was treated according to COBRA guidelines. \\r\\nIn chapter 3, we studied differences in cancer prevalence between women referred through the national screening program and a non-screening group, to assess whether the validity of SLCNB differed between these patient groups. The prevalence of carcinoma differed significantly, yet the accuracy of SLCNB did not. Therefore SLCNB appears accurate in diagnosing nonpalpable breast lesions both in screening and non-screening patients. \\r\\nIn chapter 4, we describe a subgroup of lesions for which surgical excision with SNB may be considered as the first diagnostic and therapeutic procedure. SLCNB is preferred in all other cases.\\r\\nSeeding of biopsy needle tracks with viable malignant cells is evaluated in chapter 5. We conclude that needle tracks can be found, and displaced tumourcells can be recognised. Excising and evaluating the entire needle track is not always possible, should not be recommended as a routine, since radiotherapy is advised for all types of locally excised breast cancer.\\r\\nWhen ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is diagnosed at SLCNB, invasive cancer is found in ~17% of excision specimens. These so called ‘DCIS-underestimates’ generally cause extension of treatment. In chapter 6, we evaluated DCIS-underestimates in detail and assessed reasons for missing the invasive component at SLCNB. A variety of radiological and histopathological reasons contribute to the DCIS-underestimate rate. Approximately half of these are potentially avoidable.\\r\\nChapter 7, presents a critical review of the currently available literature on the accuracy of vacuum-assisted biopsy and compare it to published data on 14G automated-needle biopsy. \\r\\nChapter 8 describes the surgical treatment results for patients diagnosed with DCIS at SLCNB. We sought preoperative determinants predicting which patients would eventually undergo mastectomy. These determinants were a history of breast cancer, mammographic lesions characterised by calcifications, measuring >17mm and classified as BI-RADS 5. Knowledge of these determinants may guide the initial surgical procedure to be more aggressive. In Chapter 9 we compared the outcomes of surgical treatment of nonpalpable breast cancer diagnosed preoperatively with SLCNB in two surgical training hospitals, and conclude that with adequate supervision, the experience of the first operating surgeon does not seem to affect the possibility of a radical resection. Chapter 10 is a general discussion.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The rapidly expanding research on photonic crystals is driven by potential applications in all-optical switches, optical computers, low-threshold lasers, and holographic data storage. The performance of such devices might surpass the speed of traditional electronics by several orders of magnitude and may result in a true revolution in nanotechnology. The heart of such devices would likely be an optical switching element. This thesis analyzes different regimes of ultrafast all-optical switching in various three-dimensional photonic crystals, in particular opals filled with silicon or vanadium dioxide and periodic arrays of silica-gold core-shell spherical particles with silica outer shell. \\r\\nIn the experiment an ultrashort optical pulse is used to excite a photonic crystal and change its complex effective dielectric constant. The change in the imaginary part of the dielectric constant corresponds to the change in absorption that suppresses interference inside the photonic crystal and modifies the amplitude of the reflectivity, while the change in the real part of the dielectric constant accounts for a shift in a spectral position of the photonic stop band.\\r\\nThe first type of switching is shown on an example of an opal filled with silicon. In this crystal, switching is induced by photo-excited carriers in silicon that act as an electron plasma and increase the absorption in silicon. Within 30 fs constructive interference inside the opal vanishes and Bragg reflectivity drops down. Changes in reflectivity reach values as high as 46% at maximum excitation power. The experimental results are in a good agreement with calculations.\\r\\nThe second type of switching is demonstrated in opal filled with vanadium dioxide. Here, the optical switching is driven by a photoinduced phase transition of vanadium dioxide. The phase transition takes place on a subpicosecond time scale and changes the effective dielectric constant of the opal. As a result, the spectral position of the photonic stop band shifts to the blue leading to large (up to 35%) changes in the reflectivity. \\r\\nMetallo-dielectric photonic crystals give even more possibilities for the band-tuning, since in addition to the resonance for light they posses surface plasmon resonances. The interplay of these resonances leads to unusual optical phenomena. As an example, reflected light produces an unexpected beaming in the apexes of a hexagon with a divergence angle of 8\\uf0b0, in our sample. This angle is too small to be attributed to a simple diffraction on the periodic lattice of core-shells but can be explained by interference between surface plasmons and propagating surface waves. Time-resolved spectra demonstrate rapid changes immediately after the arrival of the pump pulse. Ultrafast reflection changes are dramatically enhanced by the plasmon resonances, and can reach values as high as 35%.\\r\\nA completely different mechanism for ultrafast switching is explored, based on the excitation of coherent acoustic radial vibrations of the gold spheres. This results in a 4% modulation of the reflectivity on a subnanosecond timescale. The observed oscillation properties of our gold-shell spheres are in excellent agreement with the calculations. \\r\\nThe described results show that the demonstrated dynamical changes in the reflectivity of a three-dimensional photonic crystal can be made both large and ultrafast and therefore may prove to be relevant for future applications.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Increased atherosclerotic plaque formation can lead to lumen reduction and finally to lumen obstruction. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) or balloon angioplasty (dilation) are approaches generally used to treat coronary, but also peripheral atherosclerotic disease. Their goal is to restore the blood supply. The repair process or restructuring of the artery after balloon angioplasty comprises two major features, neointimal formation and geometrical remodeling, and results in a decreased lumen. In the process of atherosclerosis, and during neointimal formation and arterial remodeling, the structure of the arterial wall is changed dramatically. Collagen is one of the major components of the arterial wall, essential for arterial integrity, and therefore increased collagen synthesis and degradation are important processes.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nMatrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are key-enzymes responsible for collagen degradation, but also for cellular migration which is a well described feature in arterial remodeling. Broad spectrum inhibition of these MMPs revealed beneficial effects in the repair process after balloon dilation, but more specific inhibitors are needed due the side effects of these inhibitors. Next to their role in arterial remodeling, MMPs are also involved in atherosclerotic plaque progression. We need to understand arterial remodeling more in detail to be able to find new targets for intervention.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nThe first aim of our study was to explore the changes in collagen synthesis and degradation and the collagen content after balloon injury. We observed that collagen synthesis and degradation was increased and was associated with cell migration. We found that Hsp47, a protein essential for collagen synthesis, could be a potential new target for intervention.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nIn the second part of our study we focussed on the production and activation of the MMPs. We observed that the level of several MMPs were increased after balloon dilation, probably via a protein called extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN). Moreover, we observed that EMMPRIN forms were different between more unstable and stable atherosclerotic plaques. Therefore EMMPRIN might be a more specific target to intervene in arterial remodeling, but also for stabilization of the atherosclerotic plaque. Because EMMPRIN is an extracellular protein it is an attractive protein for intervention.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, we studied the role of furin after dilation. Furin is a proprotein convertase and involved in the activation of several proteins, including some MMPs. Blocking furin activity prevents the activation of these MMPs, but also of TGF- β. We inhibited the activity of furin after balloon dilation which resulted in an inhibition of neointima formation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nInterventions on these different proteins could have beneficial effects for patients with cardiovascular problems by reducing restenosis rates and promoting plaque stability.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['PC is the most abundant phospholipid in cellular membranes of mammalian tissues. In addition to its structural role in membranes and lipoproteins, PC functions as a major source of intracellular signalling molecules. All eukaryotic cell types and tissues display unique and stable profiles of PC and perturbation of PC homeostasis, by pharmacological agents or by genetic engineering, leads to cell death via a process called apoptosis. Although several studies describe a relation between inhibition of PC synthesis and apoptosis, the underlying signalling pathways that mediate this cell death have not been identified. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify signalling pathways that mediate apoptosis during the inhibition of PC. With the help of a genetic model, a temperature sensitive mutant MT58, we investigated the effect of PC depletion on several potential stress pathways. Furthermore we tried to elucidate which cellular event might be the trigger for the induction of apoptotic processes during prolonged inhibition of PC synthesis.\\r\\n\\t We first analysed the effect of prolonged inhibition of PC synthesis on viable MT58 cells (24 h). Despite the fact that PC synthesis is severely decreased after 24h at 40 °C, PC breakdown is even increased in MT58 cells. This results in a decrease of PC and especially in PC species, which are mono-saturated at the sn-1 position. Overall, cellular membranes in MT58 cells have the tendency to maintain a more saturated composition during incubation at the non-permissive temperature. After 24 h of PC depletion, membranes of the secretory pathway that are in a dynamic equilibrium were affected the most, such as the ER and the Golgi. These structures were highly disrupted in MT58 cells, whilst the plasma membrane, mitochondriae and the membrane of the nucleus seem to be intact. Furthermore a large accumulation of lipid droplets in the cell was occurring during PC depletion. \\r\\nBecause of the dramatic impact of PC depletion on ER and Golgi structures, the role of the ER stress response in the apoptotic process of PC depleted cells was investigated. Inhibition of PC synthesis leads to the induction of the ER stress-related, pro-apoptotic transcription factor CHOP/GADD153, but does not influence canonical ER stress events, like induction of the ER chaperone Bip, inhibition of protein translation or caspase 12 activation.\\r\\nTo identify the role of CHOP induction in PC depletion we performed studies using the promoter region of CHOP. Mutants of all putative regulatory elements in the CHOP promoter were made and we observed that CHOP expression during PC depletion is mediated via activation of a conserved region, the C/EBP-ATF site. Activation of this site seems to depend on the binding of transcription factor ATF2. Phosphorylation of ATF2 is essential for binding to the C/EBP site, but during PC depletion ATF2 phosphorylation is not mediated by JNK kinase. However, this kinase plays a role in the apoptotic process of PC depletion, because treatment of MT58 cells with the JNK inhibitor SP600125 can rescue the cells from apoptosis.\\r\\nChemical agents that inhibit PC synthesis are often used to investigate the role of PC depletion in apoptosis and furthermore they are used as neoplastic agents during anti-cancer therapy. Therefore we compared the effects of a familiar used pharmacological drug of PC synthesis inhibition, HePC with the results we found in our genetic model. Although both systems lead to an inhibition of PC synthesis and the induction of apoptosis, fundamental differences between them were observed. Treatment of HePC did not result in depletion of PC, apoptotic processes were not preceded by an induction of CHOP and HePC treated cells can be rescued by both LysoPC and LysoPE. Therefore HePC treated cells induce apoptosis probably via other pathways than the inhibition of PC. \\r\\nConsidering the underlying regulatory pathway of PC depletion-induced apoptosis, we have identified CHOP/GADD153, ATF2 and JNK as key players in cellular stress responses to inhibition of PC synthesis. Internal structures as Golgi and ER are disrupted in PC depleted cells and this event could be a trigger for the observed cellular stress pathways that eventually result in apoptosis.'],\n",

       "  'Description': [\"Traditionally, treatment and prevention of respiratory viral disease has mainly focused on influenza virus infection. The epidemiology, impact and severity of influenza virus infection have been studied extensively and it has been shown that influenza virus infection is associated with significant mortality and morbidity every year. Despite these studies influenza, like other respiratory virus infections is often unjustly considered a relatively harmless infectious disease and treatment as not being necessary. \\r\\nOver the past decades, there has been growing attention towards the role of respiratory viruses, especially in immunocompromised patients. In this thesis we aimed to develop molecular diagnostic techniques feasible for use in a routine laboratory setting, and to evaluate their clinical impact. Moreover, we used these techniques to clarify the role of respiratory viruses in specific patient groups at risk.\\r\\nIn this thesis we show that the described molecular diagnostic methods exhibit a significant advantage over the existing conventional  diagnostic methods. With the use of these sensitive detection methods we show that respiratory viruses can be detected frequently and are more often involved in serious respiratory tract infection than expected previously. \\r\\nTo determine the role of respiratory viruses in immunocompromised patients a retrospective study using the developed molecular techniques was performed in hematological cancer patients with pneumonia. With the use of these molecular diagnostics we found an increasing rate of identification from 19% to 35% compared to the conventional detection techniques. In 21% of the patients respiratory viruses were the only identified pathogen. These results led us to conduct a prospective study in which we examined the frequency and severity of respiratory virus infection in recipients who underwent autologous or allogenic stem cell transplantation. We showed an incidence of viral upper and lower respiratory tract infection of 14% with standard viral culture and with 36% with molecular diagnostics. In addition, we showed that infections with respiratory viruses occurred frequently and were associated with severe lower respiratory tract infection. The mortality associated with respiratory virus infection however was low. \\r\\nFinally, we have used the molecular diagnostic detection methods to evaluate the virus load and shedding during infection. Asthmatics often experience more pronounced symptoms during an upper respiratory tract infection than non asthmatics. In the described study we have studied the role of respiratory viruses, in asthmatic and non asthmatic subjects. We showed that the clearance of virus and maximal viral load were similar in both groups. However, the asthmatic subject experienced significantly more symptoms, mainly associated with the lower respiratory tract. These results indicate that ongoing virus replication is not the explanation for the severity of asthmatic symptoms and that other mechanisms, such as host response, may play a role in the development of symptoms.\\r\\nWith future research focused on the precise pathogenicity of the various respiratory viruses and on the host's response will be needed to further address the clinical value and cost-effectiveness of molecular diagnostic techniques for the detection of respiratory viruses.\"],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Stability and change of antisocial behavior in children and adolescents : the role of neurobiological factors'],\n",
       "  'Description': [\"Aggressive behavior has long been a major concern in our society. There is a growing consensus that disruptive behavior disorder (DBD) originates from the interaction of biologically based child characteristics with non-optimal characteristics of the child's environment. In this thesis, we investigated neurobiological correlates of aggression and the role they play in the stability of antisocial behavior and/or in changes that occur in that behavior. We did this by focusing on the relationship of aggression to cortisol and testosterone in a low socioeconomic status (SES) population-based sample, and on the relationship of aggression to cortisol and measures of the autonomic nervous system (ANS), i.e. heart rate (HR) and skin conductance level (SCL), in a sample of referred DBD children. In addition, the role of some psychological and family characteristics in stability and change was examined, although these correlates occupy a very modest place in this thesis. Within the low SES male adolescents sample, it appeared that, although we provide some evidence that cortisol and testosterone are correlates of aggressive and antisocial behavior, the relationship was not consistent with and in contrast to what is known from literature. We suggest that this may be due to the type of participants that were studied. \\r\\nFurthermore, in correspondence with the finding from previous studies, we found that antisocial behavior was relatively stable in a sample of severely disturbed DBD children. There was, however, a large variance among the outcome for adolescents. When outcome was defined in terms of DBD diagnosis, living status, delinquency, school attendance, and smoking behavior, 38% had a positive outcome and 34% had a poor outcome. Moreover, in a sample of referred DBD children, SCL in particular was found to have a predictive influence on both the effect of treatment and the stability of antisocial behaviors in adolescence. \\r\\nLow SCL is suggested to be a marker of fearlessness. A lack of fear would predispose children to antisocial and violent behavior because low fear of socializing punishment in childhood would contribute to poor fear conditioning and lack of conscience development. In addition, social conditioning plays a central role in behavior therapy. Difficulty in social conditioning due to fearlessness thus would result in low treatment effect and in the persistence of antisocial behavior.\"],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Osteoarthritis (OA) is a serious problem in the equine industry and an important cause of the (early) retirement of sport horses. Currently the diagnosis is usually based on X-rays, but by the time changes become radiographically visible, extensive (often irreversible) joint damage is present. This has led to a search for substances, socalled markers, which accurately reflect the presence and severity of OA and allow its detection at an earlier stage. At that time rest and specific medication may prevent or limit permanent damage. Synovial fluid (SF) is in direct contact with the joint capsule and cartilage and its composition reflects the state of the joint. In this thesis the value of a number of SF markers is investigated. Potential markers can be divided into markers of inflammation and of degradation. Inflammatory markers include the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a group of enzymes involved in cartilage turnover and degradation; tumour necrosis factor � (TNF-�); nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and hydroxyproline (Hyp) in SF reflect the breakdown of proteoglycans and collagen (constituents of cartilage). Age profoundly influenced all markers studied, with MMP-1 activity, GAG and Hyp levels being highest in newly born foals and declining to adult levels by the age of four years. This reflects the high rate of metabolism in young, growing animals. Exercise (a five-day training programme on a treadmill) led to a transient rise in PGE2 and TNF-� concentrations in SF, which had passed by 12 hours after the last exercise session. The same exercise regime did not influence general MMP or MMP-1 activity, GAG and NO levels. Arthrocentesis is obviously necessary for the collection of SF but is also performed in the course of lameness examinations or for the administration of intra-articular medication, but which in itself may alter SF composition. General MMP and MMP-1 activity were elevated following repeated arthrocentesis, as were PGE2, NO and GAG concentrations. Most of these ‘arthrocentesis effects’ have passed when one week separates 2 joint taps and this should be borne in mind when collecting SF for evaluation of marker levels. \\r\\nApart from these confounding factors the value of a biomarker also depends on whether levels in SF reflect the presence and severity of disease and/or the composition of articular cartilage. In the metacarpophalangeal joints of adult horses the presence of moderate-severe cartilage damage was not reflected by increased GAG, Hyp or MMP levels in SF and neither did these markers predict cartilage composition. A significant correlation between MMP activity and Hyp levels in SF in joints with moderate-severe cartilage damage suggest the MMPs play an important role in collagen degradation. Infectious arthritis was paired with elevated PGE2, MMP and GAG levels and decreased hyaluronan concentrations, while Hyp levels were not significantly altered. The correlations between PGE2 and the other parameters suggest it may be a better predictor of disease severity than the currently used white blood cell count. This research demonstrates that several confounding factors must be taken into account and controlled for when collecting SF for biomarker evaluation and that a single measurement of one marker provides little or no useful information. Therefore, a panel of markers and serial measurement should prove more valuable.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Cardiovascular diseases, in particular coronary artery disease, are the leading cause of death and disease in industrialized countries. Atherosclerotic changes of the arterial vessel wall constitute one of the major causes for the occurrence of cardiovascular disease. Important risk factors for cardiovascular disease have been identified, but they fail to explain why some patients with atherosclerosis become symptomatic and have recurrent symptomatic disease, and others do not. Apart from the extent of coronary atherosclerosis (among other factors), the susceptibility of organs to episodes of ischemia is probably of importance. Well-developed collateral vessels, or \"natural bypasses\", may offer an important alternative source of blood supply, and thereby protect an organ from episodes of ischemia. Unfortunately, not every organ or even individual has well-developed collateral vessels, if developed at all. \\r\\n\\r\\nCurrent knowledge on coronary collaterals and its most important determinants involved, are reviewed in Chapter 2. The mechanism of the development of coronary collaterals is subject to increasing preclinical and clinical research. Many factors and patient characteristics have already been proposed to play a role in collateral development. For instance, myocardial ischemia, physical exercise, hypertension, and the use of various cardiovascular drugs. So far, however, for many of these factors, results are inconsistent and, therefore, their pathophysiologic role and importance is still unclear. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, the potential clinical relevance of coronary collaterals has attracted much attention. Coronary collaterals may in fact play an important prognostic role in patients with coronary artery disease during episodes of myocardial ischemia. Well-developed coronary collaterals may determine the prognosis of a patient not only in the event of an acute myocardial infarction, but also in stable coronary artery disease. Yet, different findings have been reported so far, as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore, we first investigated several determinants of the presence and extent of coronary collaterals collectively in a single group of patients, notably cardiac ischemic burden, high blood pressure, smoking and alcohol, and the metabolic syndrome. Second, we investigated the presence and extent of coronary collaterals as a prognostic determinant of cardiovascular outcome in two different studies with different study populations.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral determinants (Chapter 3), already identified as well-established risk factors for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, turned out to play an important role in the presence of coronary collaterals, as well. These included cardiac ischemic burden (positive association), high blood pressure (inverse association), and smoking (positive association) and alcohol (J-curve). However, the metabolic syndrome, that encompasses a cluster of impaired glucose metabolism, hypertension, dyslipidemia and central obesity, was not associated.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, coronary collaterals turned out to mark an unfavourable prognosis in relatively high-risk patients, but a protective effect in relatively low-risk patients (Chapter 4). We believe that this different effect of coronary collaterals in the various risk groups may explain the conflicting evidence on the protective role of collaterals, reported in the literature, so far. \\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, in Chapter 5 we discuss these different findings by several cardiovascular endpoint-studies in greater detail. The prognostic significance of the presence of coronary collaterals appears to be considerably modified by the patient\\'s risk-level of coronary heart disease. Furthermore, we discuss the different methods, that are currently used to assess coronary collateral circulation, and in particular their relationship and limitations. We propose that the presence of coronary collaterals may provide an additional marker of myocardial vulnerability, and therefore, an additional marker to identify the \"vulnerable patient\". In addition, in particular for those patients with myocardial ischemia and at low cardiac risk, who are unsuitable for conventional coronary interventions, therapeutic induction of coronary collateral growth may provide an attractive treatment option.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a paralytic neurodegenerative disorder, characterised by a specific loss of motoneurons. Although the exact pathogenesis is largely enigmatic, it is known that glutamate excitotoxicity plays an important role in motoneuron cell death. Glutamate is one of the major neurotransmitters in the central nervous system. Relative high levels of glutamate can lead to motoneuron death by overstimulation of calcium-permeable receptors, resulting in an excess influx of calcium. This can lead to activation of several death-inducing pathways. Therefore, it is of great significance to keep the extracellular glutamate levels at a non-toxic value. Under physiological conditions the glutamate transporter EAAT2, predominantly expressed by astrocytes, accomplishes the majority of the glutamate uptake from the synaptic cleft. In ALS patients and in ALS animal models, however, it is found that EAAT2 protein and functioning is decreased. The aim of the studies described in this thesis was to protect motoneurons from excitotoxicity by overexpressing the glutamate transporter EAAT2 in a localised, long-term manner via gene therapy, both ex vivo and in vivo gene therapy are exploited for this purpose. \\r\\nIn the first part of this thesis we examined the possibilities for ex vivo gene therapy. To this end, HEK-cells were genetically engineered to overexpress EAAT2. This resulted in an increase in EAAT2 protein as well as a profuse increase in glutamate uptake compared to wild-type cells. Furthermore, the engineered cells protected primary motoneurons in culture from an glutamate-induced toxicity. Hence, it might be worthwhile to investigate whether ex vivo gene therapy for EAAT2 might be of therapeutic value in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.\\r\\nIn the second part of this thesis we further examined the possibilities for in vivo gene therapy with the use of lentiviral vectors (LVV) to overexpress EAAT2. For this purpose we first examined the cellular pattern of LVV-mediated gene transduction in mouse spinal cord both in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, organotypic mouse spinal cord cultures were treated with LVV-green fluorescent protein (GFP) in vitro and wild-type mice were intraspinally injected with LVV-GFP at the level of vertebra L1. In both situations GFP expression was found to be expressed predominately by astrocytes, while the neuronal cells were virtually not transduced. Next, we examined whether LVV-EAAT2 could be used as a tool to deliver EAAT2 to primary adult human astrocytes from either cortical or spinal post-mortem brain tissue. Concomitant with a marked increase in EAAT2 mRNA and EAAT2 protein, a significant increase in functional glutamate uptake was observed in LVV-EAAT2 treated astrocytic cultures compared to LVV-GFP treated controls. \\r\\nFinally, we examined the neuroprotective efficacy of intraspinally delivered LVV-EAAT2 on the course of the disease in G93A-hSOD1 ALS mice by using motor performance and body weight as clinical parameters. We found that EAAT2 was effectively transduced in the spinal cord, but that disease onset and survival in the LVV-EAAT2 treated mice did not significantly differ from either LVV-GFP treated or naive control mice. We concluded that, although LVV-EAAT2 did not effect the clinical outcome of ALS mice, as such LVV can be successfully used to deliver therapeutic genes into spinal astrocytes.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Insulin in the central nervous system affects processes that involve learning and memory, synaptic plasticity and neuronal survival. However, the mechanism by which insulin affects these processes is unclear. In addition, the mechanism underlying the negative influence of hyperinsulinemia in the pathology of disease is also not known. The aim of this thesis was to explore how insulin modulates intracellular\\xa0signaling routes and how these routes relate to long lasting changes in synaptic plasticity. In chapter 2, the intracellular routes activated in response to insulin in cells of neuronal origin were investigated. In addition to this, the effect of insulin on intracellular crosstalk between kinases was studied. Since insulin has been described to have both beneficial and negative effects related to the period of insulin administration (see above), short- and long-term insulin treatment and its effects on the activation of\\xa0signaling routes were investigated. \\n\\r\\nSince insulin has been shown to have an effect on synaptic plasticity, the effect of insulin on synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus was investigated (chapter 3). Additionally, a signal transduction route which functions as a mediator of insulin\\xa0signaling we described in chapter 2 was studied.In chapter 4, a review of the literature on FoxO proteins and their regulation by insulin and insulin like factors is provided. The upstream signaling components which regulate FoxO proteins and the transcriptional mechanism regulating FoxO target genes and function are described. Finally, the in vivo relevance of FoxO factors in regulating metabolism and homeostasis is discussed. In chapter 5, the identification of FoxO6 from brain tissue, a novel member of the FoxO subgroup of forkhead transcription factors which serves as a transcriptional end-point of insulin\\xa0signaling is described. In chapter 6, the intra-molecular mechanisms underlying FoxO6 function are described to gain more insight into how insulin or other growth factors influence the activity of FoxO6. In chapter 7, the results obtained are summarized and their relevance for insulin\\xa0signaling, neuronal metabolism and survival is discussed.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Due to variation in drug distribution, metabolism and elimination processes between patients, systemic exposure to chemotherapeutic agents may be highly variable from patient to patient after administration of similar doses. This pharmacokinetic variability may explain in part the large variability in therapeutic response seen in patients receiving chemotherapy. Patients receiving high exposures of a chemotherapeutic agent may show a better response to therapy but are also at higher risk for toxicity, while patients with lower exposures may have a reduced therapeutic response but also a lower risk of experiencing side-effects. The optimal exposure in a patient results in an adequate therapeutic response with low risk of adverse effects. \\r\\nRelationships between systemic exposure and toxic or therapeutic effects have been demonstrated for several anticancer drugs. These relationships may be used to optimize the administration of chemotherapeutic agents applying pharmacokinetically guided dosing (PKGD). However, measurement of plasma drug levels for dosing are not regularly performed with these agents. \\r\\nThis thesis deals with PKGD of the four chemotherapeutic agents cyclophosphamide, thiotepa, carboplatin (as administered in the high-dose CTC regimen) and paclitaxel. To be able to implement this dosing strategy in clinical practice, we firstly worked on a fast and robust bioanalytical method for the quantification of cyclophosphamide and thiotepa and their relevant active metabolites using HPLC-MS/MS. Furthermore, we performed extensive population pharmacokinetic analysis to accurately describe the time-course of cyclophosphamide (and multiple metabolites), thiotepa (and its metabolite tepa), carboplatin and paclitaxel concentrations in plasma using non-linear regression methods. These models formed the basis for the Bayesian dosing strategy we applied for the PKGD strategy. Factors influencing the pharmacokinetic profile of cyclophosphamide, thiotepa and carboplatin were also established: Co-medicated agents such as phenytoin and aprepitant, as well as serum creatinine levels and obesity appeared to influence the pharmacokinetics of cyclophosphamide, thiotepa and/or carboplatin. Moreover, we established relationships between toxicity (irreversible alopecia and veno-occlusive disease of the liver (VOD)) and exposure to cyclophosphamide, thiotepa and carboplatin (or metabolites), which stress the importance of pharmacokinetically guided dosing in the CTC regimen in reducing or preventing the occurrence of these toxicities. Finally, pharmacokinetically guided dosing strategies for cyclophosphamide, thiotepa, carboplatin and paclitaxel were developed and validated in a prospective manner. In the CTC scheme, a total of 46 patients received adapted doses of cyclophosphamide, thiotepa and carboplatin based on their individual pharmacokinetic profile. A total of 25 patients with non-small cell lung cancer received multiple individualized paclitaxel administrations. The studies proved that the pharmacokinetically guided dosing strategy results in an effective reduction of interindividual variability in exposure to the compounds or their metabolites and is feasible in clinical practice. Whether the dosing strategy also results in reduction of toxicity and/or improvement of therapeutic outcome remains to be determined from larger studies, preferably in a randomized setting. \\r\\nIn conclusion, a very significant therapeutic gain may be achievable by individualized dosing of chemotherapeutic agents to produce a uniformly high, effective yet safe drug exposure in each patient.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['This thesis is primarily focused on the previously hardly explored role of HIF-1 in breast cancer. HIF-1 is a transcription factor induced by hypoxia, but also by some oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes and growth factors. Activated HIF-1 can induce angiogenesis, glycolysis, erythropoiesis, and other processes allowing cells to survive during hypoxia or hypoglycaemia. These processes are also involved in the development of breast cancer and subsequent formation of metastases. Thus, HIF-1 could be suspected to play an important role in breast cancer. If so, HIF-1 would be a potential therapeutic target because of its broad regulatory impact. \\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe therefore tried to unravel the role of HIF-1 in breast carcinogenesis, its interaction with cell cycle proteins, growth factors and steroid receptors. In addition, we determined the role of HIF-1 as a prognosticator.\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom a clinical point of view, we tried to answer the question why different breast cancer patients show such a broad variety in 18FDG (radioactively labeled glucose analogue) signal intensity as measured by positron emission tomography (PET). We composed a model with most important determinants of quantitative glucose metabolism in breast cancer, assuming a role of HIF-1 in the variable uptake of 18FDG. \\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFurther, we hypothesized that the cell cycle regulating protein BCL-6 is not only involved in lymphomas, but might also be present in breast cancer. In fact, our data not only showed the presence of BCL-6 in breast cancer, but, also an association of BCL-6 with HIF-1.\\r\\n\\r\\nConclusions\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n1. \\tDifferent stages of human breast carcinogenesis were studied for expression of HIF-1α. We noted the overexpression of HIF-1α in precursor lesions (ductal carcinoma in situ) as well as in invasive cancer specimens. In contrast, we did not detect increased levels of HIF-1α in tissue specimens of normal breast nor in areas with ductal hyperplasia.\\n\\r\\n 2.\\t\\tBoth cellular hypoxia and oncogenes are considered main activators of HIF-1 activity in breast cancer, with a minor role for immune modulators. Unraveling whether hypoxia, oncogenes or growth factors are responsible for HIF-1 activation will identify potential therapeutic targets. In the present thesis, we link both HER-2/neu, EGFR and PDGF with HIF-1 activation.\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n3.\\t\\tBlocking HIF-1 seems to be attractive in breast cancer treatment since several downstream effects of HIF-1 (such as VEGF production, formation of angiogenesis, and stimulation of glycolysis) all potentiate aggressiveness of breast cancer.\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n4.\\t\\tAs a consequence, levels of HIF-1α represent tumor aggressiveness and predict prognosis. This is especially valuable to identify high risk lymph node negative breast cancer patients, and might be used for further studies to assess the risk of pure DCIS recurrence.\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n5.\\t\\tBCL-6 protein is overexpressed in breast cancer, possibly due to gene amplification, and is associated with p53, cyclin D1 and HIF-1α. \\n\\r\\n\\r\\n6.\\t\\tThe different intensity of FDG-PET scanning between breast cancer patients can be explained by a biologic model of glucose transport and rate of proliferation per tumor volume.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['It is generally assumed that the\\r\\nincidence of allergies in the Western world has been rising over the past few\\r\\ndecades. Apple allergy was chosen as a model system because apples are widely\\r\\nconsumed in Europe and they frequently cause allergic reactions with a variable\\r\\ndegree of severity. In Northern and Central Europe, apple\\r\\nallergy has always been described as a mild disease. More recent observations\\r\\nfrom Southern European countries indicate that apple can induce severe systemic\\r\\nreactions as well. \\n\\r\\nChapter 2\\r\\ndescribes the apple allergic patients from Austria, Italy, Spain and The Netherlands. Different sensitization patterns were studied RAST, SPT and. clinical\\r\\nhistories were studied. Our studies in four European countries have confirmed\\r\\nthat the presence of birch trees is a dominant factor in sensitization to the\\r\\nmajor apple allergen Mal d 1. Primary sensitization to the major birch pollen\\r\\nallergen Bet v 1 is at the basis of IgE recognition of Mal d 1 in Northern and Central Europe. Apple allergy (LTP) in Spain is most likely a result of\\r\\nprimary sensitization to peach. It can also not be ruled out completely that\\r\\nspecific pollen in the Mediterranean are at the basis of LTP sensitization.\\n\\r\\nIn Chapters 3\\r\\nand 4 two novel forms of cross-reactive food allergies among birch pollen\\r\\nallergic patients are presented, i.e. to jackfruit and sharonfruit. In both\\r\\ncases patients reacted on the first exposure to the fruit involved and more\\r\\nseverely than they used to do on apple and other fruits. These studies suggest\\r\\nthat some food homologs of Bet v 1 might be more stable than the extremely\\r\\nlabile Mal d 1 from apple. Jackfruit and sharonfruit allergy can be added to\\r\\nthe list of birch pollen related food allergies. Increased consumption of these\\r\\nfruits will result in a rise in allergic symptoms. \\n\\r\\nTreatment of food allergic patients is primarily based on\\r\\navoidance diets. Such diets can have a considerable social impact and lead to\\r\\nnutritional deficiencies. \\n\\r\\nIn Chapter 5\\r\\nthe allergenicity of different apple cultivars was assessed by SPT and\\r\\ndouble-blind, placebo controlled food challenge to develop hypoallergenic fruit\\n\\r\\nChapter 6\\r\\ndescribes the development of a hypoallergenic apple plant in which the Mal d 1\\r\\ngene was knocked out by RNA interference. Using leaf material of young\\r\\nplantlets for SPT and immunoblot, it was demonstrated that Mal d 1 activity was\\r\\nindeed reduced significantly in the mutant plantlets. \\n\\r\\nPublic opinion\\r\\non genetically modified foods has proven to be perhaps a bigger hurdle. The\\r\\nattitude of the allergic patients towards hypoallergenic genetically modified\\r\\nfoods was investigated and described in \\n\\r\\nChapter 7. Finally, two chapters\\r\\nfocus on strategies for allergen-specific immunotherapy. Specific immunotherapy is not used to treat food allergies.\\r\\nA major problem of immunotherapy using food allergens is the risk of severe\\r\\nside effects, including anaphylactic shock.\\n\\r\\nIn Chapter 8,\\r\\na study using birch pollen immunotherapy trial is described in which the effect\\r\\non cross-reactive apple allergy is evaluated by SPT and DBPCFC. Our clinical\\r\\ntrial supports earlier claims that birch pollen immunotherapy has a beneficial\\r\\neffect on cross-reactive food allergies. \\n\\r\\nIn Chapter 9, a recently\\r\\ndeveloped hypoallergenic mutant of the major apple allergen Mal d 1 is\\r\\nevaluated in vivo using SPT and DBPCFC.

       "  'Description': [\"The main purpose of this study was to investigate quality of life in patients' who had survived a cardiac arrest and were treated with an implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD). Two groups were compared, those that had received an ICD with those that were treated otherwise. This thesis comprises several studies on cardiac arrest survivors and especially those that received an ICD therapy.\\r\\nIn chapter 1 we described quality of life and the determinants of quality of life. The study design is also described in this chapter.\\r\\nThe sample consisted of 168 consecutive patients who were admitted to the hospital after OHCA. The patients completed a questionnaire at baseline, and at one, six and 12 months. The questionnaire contained items on quality of life (Rand-36 and HPPQ), depressive symptomatology (CES-D), anxiety (State Trait Anxiety Inventory), coping (Utrecht Coping List), social support ( Social Support List Interactions), social activities (subscale EORTC), sexuality (subscale EORTC), satisfaction with patient education (patient education questionnaire), continuity of care (CCCpQ) and utilization of care (RC-UD survey).\\r\\nIn Chapter 2 the results are presented on the relationship between continuity of care and quality of life. We found no significant association between patient education, continuity of care and quality of life in either group. We, however, did find an association between patient satisfaction with received care and quality of life.\\r\\nChapter 3 reports on a 12 month quality of life assessment of cardiac arrest survivors treated with or without an implantable cardioverter defibrillator. No differences were found between the ICD group and control group regarding quality of life and well-being. A significant improvement in physical and social functioning, and mental health were found in the first six months. The prevalence of anxiety and probable depression was high irrespective of the treatment received: anxiety and depressive symptoms did not change significantly between 1 and 12 months after discharge.\\r\\nChapter 4 details the factors that predict quality of life and depression in ICD recipients.\\r\\nMental health, appraisal support, feelings of displeasure and physical functioning measured at baseline (before treatment) were significant predictors of quality of life in ICD recipients at 12 months.\\r\\nIn Chapter 5 we assessed quality of life, depression and anxiety in ICD recipients who did and did not experience an ICD shock delivery. Significant differences were found within the groups over time regarding physical role limitations (p < 0.051). Those who experienced shocks throughout the year (group 1) felt more limited in their daily activities due to physical or mental problems. We concluded that overall quality of life and psychological well-being did not change in ICD recipients, irrespective of whether they experienced defibrillatory shocks. \\r\\nChapter 6 describes the content of the qualitative study. Seven major categories were derived from the analysis: anxiety, uncertainty, disappointment, frustration, unexpected barriers, acceptance of and dependency on the ICD played a major role in the lives of ICD recipients.\\r\\nThis study leads us to believe that survival of cardiac arrest has a greater impact on quality of life than the type of therapy received after the event.\"],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The principal goal of this work was to test the hypothesis that the joint should not be viewed as a composite structure consisting of a number of different and distinct connective tissue layers, but rather as an “organ” that is made up of functionally related tissues that share many characteristics and reaction patterns. A second aim, more practical in character, was to identify pathology-driven changes in this entity of functionally related tissue layers and in synovial fluid that might be classified as early signs of OA.\\n \\r\\nTo realise the main goals of this thesis, i.e. to determine whether there is indeed a functional connection between articular cartilage, subchondral and trabecular bone, an extensive comparative biochemical analysis was performed to assess the normal biochemical composition in mature animals without signs of disease (Chapter II). The strong influence of biomechanical loading on local tissue characteristics led to the study of two differently loaded sites.\\n\\r\\nThe main question in Chapter III is to what extent the functional adaptation to loading is a generalised phenomenon across all layers in the joint and also whether differences exist in the age at which site differences develop between the organic and inorganic (mineral) components of subchondral or trabecular bone. This area has not been previously explored, but is of great interest in the equine industry given the high incidence of bone-related problems in horses that are strenuously trained at a young age.\\n\\r\\nChapter IV compares normal tissue specimens with specimens from horses showing signs of (early) OA. Are these changes more evident or more extensive in one layer than in the other? Without the pretension of providing the definitive answer, it could be expected that, if such differences were to exist, they might at last give an indication on the origin of OA.\\n\\r\\nIn Chapter V the matter of early OA is pursued further. This chapter can be seen as complimentary to the other four given the role of synovial fluid as a reflection of what happens at tissue level.\\n\\r\\nChapter VI returns to the tissue level, but uses new and so far unexplored parameters for the detection of pathological processes in the three layers of tissue that make up the load bearing surface of the joint. In this chapter attention is focused on nitrite as a measure for the highly volatile NO, and on nitrotyrosine, a metabolite of NO. The combination of the two may give information on both metabolic and disease status of tissues.\\n \\r\\nIn Chapter VII the key word is load and the crucial question regards the way the horse, or more specifically the equine musculoskeletal system, copes with load. As the last chapter of this thesis, it places the main findings of the work in this perspective. The chapter further tries to relate these findings to other recent work in the horse and in other species, as the general concepts of articular (patho)biology have a much wider application than a single species.'],\n",

Dental occlusion and skeletal relationships are abnormal before treatment and change as a result of the treatment. It is likely that this will be reflected in the function of the masticatory system. The aim of this thesis was to analyze masticatory function during the various phases of treatment in patients with a mandibular retrognathism who are undergoing mandibular advancement surgery.\\r\\nIn order to quantify masticatory function, the following parameters were measured. After a fixed number of chewing cycles on cubes of a silicone rubber, the median size of the fragmented particles was determined with a sieving procedure as a measure of masticatory performance. The breakdown of food particles can be considered as the composite result of selection and breakage. Selection is the chance that a food particle is at least damaged during a chew. Breakage refers to the extent to which a particle, once selected, is fragmented. For three particle sizes, both parameters were determined in one-chew experiments. Maximum bite force was measured bilaterally at the level of the first molars using a bite fork with 2 force transducers. Electromyographic activity (EMG) of the anterior temporal muscle and the masseter muscle was recorded bilaterally during isometric clenching at maximal and submaximal bite force levels and during the chewing experiments. EMG was expressed as a function of bite force which gives an indication of muscle efficiency. \\r\\nBefore any treatment, compared with controls, in patients masticatory performance, selection and breakage are impaired and maximum bite force is lower.  \\r\\nAs a result of presurgical orthodontics, masticatory performance, selection, breakage, and maximum bite force did not change. \\r\\nAfter surgical advancement of the mandible and after completion of postsurgical orthodontics (1-1.5 years after surgery), masticatory performance, selection and breakage, maximum bite force, EMG during maximal clenching and peak EMG during chewing were essentially not changed and values were below those found in controls. Treatment did not change EMG/bite force relationships. The EMG/bite-force ratio determined at 10% - 40% of the maximum bite force was higher in patients, indicating lower efficiency for patients when less than half of the maximum bite force is applied. This finding is interesting, since muscle activities up to approximately 50% of the maximum EMG were used during chewing.\\r\\nFive years after surgery, masticatory performance did improve, particularly in patients with a poor masticatory performance before surgery. However, control values were not reached. Maximum bite force did not change and was still lower than in controls.\\r\\nIn this study we found that in retrognathic patients before treatment, masticatory function was impaired. Treatment did hardly influence masticatory function. Nevertheless, years after surgery, improvement of the chewing performance may occur, mainly in patients with a poor masticatory performance before treatment.'],\n",

Different types of genetic alterations include: DNA copy number gains/amplifications, deletions, inversions, translocations, point mutations and epigenetic gene modifications. Over the years, different technological advances have made it possible to detect many of these in a high throughput fashion. One such technique, comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), allows detection of genetic aberrations that result in a change in DNA copy number.\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe introduced the first human genome-wide array CGH platform which could be used to detect both low-level DNA copy number aberrations including homozygous deletions as well as high level amplifications in cell lines and clinical samples (chapter 3).\\r\\nGiven the accuracy and robustness by which one can quantitatively detect copy number aberrations, there are a plethora of applications for this technology. One can map recurrent regions of copy number aberration in a series of tumors and by doing so identify possible driver genes for tumor formation, progression or maintenance (chapters 6 and 8). One can also investigate the origin of metastases and the relatedness of local recurrences and second primaries (chapter 7). From a different point of view, one can start to investigate what the relationship is between underlying genetic defects and the types and numbers of DNA copy number aberrations present in the tumor (chapter 5).\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUsing a mouse genome-wide array CGH platform, we show that different inbred and outbred laboratory mouse strains are characterized by the presence of multiple DNA copy number polymorphisms (chapter 4). The majority of these polymorphisms are recurrent among different individuals from one strain and all analyzed strains could be distinguished based on their polymorphism profile. We also introduce a novel approach for determining regions of heterozygosity in different backcross mice using array CGH. This approach is faster than conventional methods for determining regions of heterozygosity.'],\n",

Postimplant dose calculations frequently show that the dose delivered to the prostate is lower than the prescribed dose. This problem is investigated by evaluation of the dose distribution of 130 patients four weeks after the implantation of the Iodine seeds (chapter 6). The research was focussed on two implantation techniques and two techniques for imaging of the prostate (magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound).

       "  'Description': ['Most drugs display their therapeutic activity on specific places in the human body and should reach the systemic circulation in order to be transported towards the site of action. Irrespective of the route of administration the same sequence of steps are of relevance for the exposure to a drug: release from the dosage form (dissolution), absorption into the blood (permeation through a biological membrane) and finally removal from the body (metabolism and elimination).\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first part of this thesis focusses on the physicochemical properties of drugs. Chapter 2 evaluates the physicochemical properties of drugs required to achieve appropriate absorption upon several routes of administration (oral, transdermal, buccal/sublingual, nasal and vaginal). It appeared that the physicochemical properties required for absorption do not vary to a large extent through the different routes of administration and the solubility was identified as one of the most critical parameters emphasizing the importance of the formulation.\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the second study the physicochemical properties and gastrointestinal permeability of steroids were evaluated in relation to absorption (chapter 3). Of the calculated physicochemical properties (molecular weight, number of hydrogen bond donor and acceptor sites, number of rotatable bonds, Polar Surface Area and ClogP) ClogP was the most discriminative descriptor. The measured apparent permeability coefficients (Papp, Caco-2 cells) showed that all steroids were well transported over the cell monolayers.\\r\\nIn the next study the gastrointestinal absorption and P-glycoprotein (Pgp) efflux transport of heterocyclic drugs was investigated (chapter 4). Since Pgp is expressed at the Blood Brain Barrier as well, it can be expected that CNS penetration will be impaired if a drug is a Pgp substrate. The transport data showed that most drugs tested display a high permeability over the cells and that the Pgp efflux transporter was expressed. However, no correlation could be found between brain penetration in rats and the Pgp efflux ratio as measured with the Caco-2 cells.\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAn alternative route for intestinal absorption is lymphatic uptake. The major advantages are found in the fact that first pass metabolism is circumvented and the possibility to deliver very hydrophobic drugs to the systemic circulation. It was investigated whether it is feasible to predict the potential of drugs for lymphatic absorption (chapter 5). It was shown that partition coefficients (octanol/water, ex vivo dog lymph or Intralipd) offer the possibility to assess the potential for lymphatic transport of drugs. The Caco-2 transport data showed that Caco-2 cells are not suitable for assessing the potential of drugs for lymphatic absorption.\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the second study involving lymphatic drug delivery, the contribution of lymphatic absorption of testosterone undecanoate (TU), a very hydrophobic drug, to the systemic exposure of testosterone (T) was determined (chapter 6). In a thoracic lymph duct-cannulated dog model, the oral bioavailability and lymphatic transport of TU after postprandial administration was determined. These data demonstrate that intestinal lymphatic transport of TU is responsible for the systemic exposure of T by avoiding the extensive first-pass effect.\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, a novel methodology was proposed to evaluate the possibility for waiving bioequivalence studies on the basis of standard human pharmacokinetic data (chapter 7).\\r\\nIt was shown that if a drug exhibits dose linear pharmacokinetics and a sufficiently fast dissolution profile, it can be concluded that this drug appears to pose no problem with respect to absorption. Provided that the dissolution profiles of the different formulations are equal bioequivalence can be guaranteed.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Post translational modification plays an important role in the regulation of cellular functions via the modulation of the structural and functional properties of strategically selected proteins. Through the key mechanism of protein phosphorylation, proteins can be rapidly and reversibly modified, providing and ‘on-off switch’ for a given protein activity. Protein kinases and protein phosphatases are the key regulators in protein phosphorylation and protein dephosphorylation processes. Consequently, protein kinases and phosphatases are together with their corresponding protein substrates intensely studied in an effort to elucidate signaling pathways mediated via reversible protein phosphorylation. In particular protein kinases are intriguing enzymes, since they are endowed with a tremendous precision in recognizing their target.\\r\\nThe primary goal of the work described in this thesis was aimed at gathering biochemical insight into structural and functional aspects of the 3’-,5’- cyclic guanosine monophosphate dependent protein kinase (PKG) type Iα using mass spectrometry based approaches. Type Iα PKG mediates essential physiological functions in cGMP-signaling pathways in for example vascular smooth muscle cells. Although there is significant progress in understanding the specific functional role of PKG, relative little is known about the overall structure of PKG, the significance of its autophosphorylation reaction, the nature of conformational changes induced by the binding of its various ligands, substrates and or inhibitors. New information about these molecular determinants is of importance in the design of molecular tools to delineate cGMP-signaling networks and eventually for future therapeutics that may target PKG-mediated signaling pathways.\\r\\nNon-covalent interactions between PKG and its natural activator cGMP, ATP and ATP analogs, as well as potent peptide inhibitors such as DT2 were studied by nanoflow electrospray mass spectrometry. Insight into binding order and stoichiometry of the various ligands could be directly derived from the acquired mass spectra. An interesting observation made in these studies is the unusual binding behavior of DT2. Mass spectra of PKG, acquired in the presence of cGMP and DT2, showed that preferentially 1 DT2 peptide binds to dimeric PKG. In addition, since high-resolution structural information is currently not available for PKG, binding sites of substrate and inhibitor peptides were localized using an approach combining photoaffinity labeling, stable isotope labeling and mass spectrometry. This approach was first tested on a highly specific substrate peptide. Initial results demonstrated that this peptide binds directly to the active site of PKG, and more importantly, binding is cGMP-dependent. Finally, a new and innovative method for the selective enrichment of phosphopeptides was developed. This method is based on the unique ion-exchange properties of spherical titanium oxide particles. In an on-line configuration phosphorylated peptides could be isolated from the non-phosphorylated peptides. Using this setup the autophosphorylation reaction of PKG was examined in time. Up to 8 phosphorylation sites were identified, of which 2 were previously uncharacterized. These results clearly show that titanium oxide has a high potential in the field of phosphoproteomics.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Teat condition in dairy cows'],\n",
       "  'Description': [\"The dairy cow's teat is the first line of defence against mastitis pathogens. The milking process may affect the teat's condition, increasing the risk of mastitis. It is well-proven that teat-ends with severe erosions or broken skin will have an increased risk of mastitis. However, more common changes in teat condition because of milking have not been related to udder health problems. The focus of this thesis was on the relationship between teat-end condition, machine milking and occurrence of mastitis. In this thesis, two types of changes of teat-end condition were distinguished: callosity rings around the orifice and machine-induced teat swelling. \\n\\r\\nA classification system of the callosity rings around the orifice was defined: the teat-end callosity (TEC) classification system. In this system, a distinction is made between roughness of the callosity ring (TECR) and thickness of the callosity ring (TECT). The developed TEC classification system was used in a 1½ year longitudinal field study on 15 farms to examine the relationship between TEC and the incidence of clinical mastitis. Teats with a thin and smooth TEC ring showed the lowest incidence risk of clinical mastitis.\\n\\r\\nTo evaluate TEC in the field, a simplified 4-category scoring system is suggested and used in an observational study on 200 dairy farms. Variation in %ROUGH between farms is explained by cow factors such as teat-end shape and machine-on time and milking machine factors such as the liner and the vacuum. \\n\\r\\nIn order to measure machine-induced teat swelling, a methodology, using ultrasound, has been developed. Using this method, the changes of teat tissue in relation to machine milking and the recovery time of teat tissue after milking were evaluated. 8 h after milking, the teat-end width and the teat-canal length still differed from before milking. The teat-wall thickness and the teat-cistern width were recovered after 6 and 8 h. \\n\\r\\nThe overall conclusion of this thesis is that a healthy teat of a dairy cow has a good balance between the physiological reaction to machine milking and maintaining its first line of defence mechanism against invading mastitis pathogens. Increasing rates of IMI were related to one or more of the following: a high degree of machine-induced swelling, a high level of TECT, a high level of TECR and the absence of TEC. Pathways through which these machine-induced changes lowered the resistance of the teat to bacterial invasion are the openness of the teat canal, harbouring of pathogens in TEC, and significantly increased or decreased level of keratin regeneration rate. Part of the impaired reaction of the teat to machine milking may lay in the peak milkflow rate. Suggestions are made to adjust the characteristics of machine milking to the milk flow profile of an individual cow. This can minimise machine-induced teat condition problems.\\n\\r\\nTeat condition changes can be used as an early warning signal for enhanced risk of clinical mastitis. Classification of teat condition is an essential tool in milking machine research and a useful monitoring tool of the quality of milking in the field. Protocols for systematic evaluation of teat condition are available.\"],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The pathogenesis of Dobermann hepatitis has been under debate for several years. In this thesis two hypotheses were formulated and discussed. \\r\\n\\r\\nHypothesis 1: In Dobermann dogs exists an autosomal genetic error in metabolism that leads to an abnormal copper metabolism which results in an increased hepatic copper concentration and leads to a (subclinical) hepatitis. \\r\\n\\r\\nHypothesis 2:  Some Dobermann dogs may have a specific DLA (dog leukocyte antigen) configuration that is associated with an abnormal or inadequate response on an (normal) immune-stimulation which prones to autoimmune hepatitis. \\r\\n\\r\\nTo investigate morbidity and mortality in this breed questionnaires were sent randomly to owners of 928 Dobermann dogs registered over seven different years. A proportional mortality of 3.7% was found for Dobermann hepatitis and in the group alive a prevalence of 0.8%.  The prevalence of subclinical hepatitis was also investigated in a group of 106 randomly selected 3 year old Dobermann dogs. Histopathologic examination of liver samples revealed subclinical hepatitis in 22 dogs (19 females and 3 males). Liver copper concentrations measured using instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA), was significantly higher (419  ± 414 mg/kg dry matter; mean  ± SD) (p=0.0008) in dogs with hepatitis than those without liver disease (197  ± 113 mg/kg; mean  ± SD). At 2.6  ± 0.6 years hepatitis persisted in 6 and the average copper concentration (939  ± 299 mg/kg) had continued to rise significantly (p=0.02). The hepatitis was associated with apoptotic hepatocytes and copper-laden Kupffer cells in centrolobular regions. The hepatobiliary copper excretion is examined by means of an intravenously administered radioactive copper isotope (64Cu) in both normal Dobermanns as well as patients. Plasma clearance values were in all dogs comparable without significant differences. The excretion of 64Cu into the bile was significantly less for the Dobermann dogs with subclinical hepatitis compared to the normal dogs which suggests an impaired copper excretion. Cholestasis was excluded by means of a 99mTc- Bis-IDA hepatobiliary scintigraphy. \\r\\n\\r\\nA quantitative Real-Time PCR was used to determine differentially expressed genes involved in copper metabolism and ROS defences. Most mRNA levels of proteins were around control values in the CASH group. In contrast, many of these proteins  were significantly reduced in the DH group. We also performed a candidate gene scan  for CTR1, Ceruloplasmin, Metallothionein, ATP7A, ATP7B, Murr1, COX17, ATOX1 and all had to be excluded. \\r\\n \\r\\nSince Dobermann hepatitis might also be (partly) immune-mediated we used an androgen (double blinded placebo controlled) for 4 months but no effect was found. We also treated five female Dobermann dogs with increased hepatic copper concentrations and persistent subclinical hepatitis with D-penicillamine for 4 months. The copper concentrations had decreased in all of the dogs (P=0.03) and histopathology returned to normal. Lastly DLA Class II allele variations are described. There was no prevalent DLA allele or haplotype in either of the disease groups. The majority of dogs was homozygous for one haplotype that had a frequency of 88.75% in the entire group of Dobermans. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe concluded that Dobermann dogs have an inborn error of metabolism that results in a decreased biliary copper excretion. Since Dobermann dogs with CASH or DH do not show a variation in DLA haplotypes if compared with normal Dobermann dogs we did not found proof to support the second hypothesis.'],\n",

It primarily affects large and giant breed dogs with Dobermanns being one of the most frequently affected. The high prevalence of DCM in specific breeds suggests a genetic background, but causal mutations have not yet been identified.\\r\\nThe main objective of the study described in this thesis was to identify the\\r\\ngene(s) involved in DCM in the Dobermann. For that purpose, the genes of interest were evaluated. Due to close similarities in human and canine DCM, mutated genes identified to cause DCM in the human are good candidate genes for DCM in dogs. At the outset of the DCM research project in 2001, most of the DCM candidate genes had not yet been mapped and the dog genome resources were limited. Therefore, bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones carrying the genes of interest were isolated from the canine BAC library. Microsatellite markers isolated from the BAC clones were typed in the Dobermanns and evaluated for association with the DCM phenotype. While the genes encoding desmin, phospholamban, ?-tropomyosin and ?-sarcoglycan were excluded as DCM causing genes, the genotyping results of the titin markers point to a crucial role of titin in DCM susceptibility.\\r\\nThe genetic markers and sequencing oligonucleotide primers reported in this\\r\\nthesis are tools that will enable fast evaluation of the DCM candidate genes in breeds other than the Dobermann.

       "  'Description': [\"The phosphorylation of proteins catalyzed by the protein kinases is one of the most important post-translational modifications found in the living cells and is involved in the control, either directly or indirectly, of all processes occurring in the cell. A major challenge in the signal transduction field is to define sequence, structural and mechanistic features responsible for the substrate selectivity, regulation and cellular function of individual protein kinases. We took part in this challenge and studied the family of Testis Specific Serine-threonine Kinases (TSSK) that comprises four members up to date. These kinases are expressed exclusively in testis during spermatogenesis and therefore they are the potential candidates that could be critical for fertilization. The main aim of this thesis was to give more insight into the biochemical properties and possible function(s) of TSSK3. Chapter 2 describes the analysis of biochemical properties, substrate specificity and in vitro activation of one of TSSK family members, TSSK3. In vitro TSSK3 exhibited the ability to autophosphorylate and to phosphorylate test substrates providing the evidence that TSSK3 is a genuine kinase. Sequence comparison indicated the existence within the TSSK3 catalytic domain of a so-called 'T-loop' a structure present in the AGC-family of protein kinases. To test if this T-loop is engaged in TSSK3 regulation, we mutated the critical threonine within the T-loop to alanine (T168A) and this resulted in an inactive TSSK3 kinase. Furthermore in vitro Thr-168 is phosphorylated by the T-loop kinase phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) and phosphorylation by PDK1 increased in vitro TSSK3 kinase activity, suggesting that TSSK3 can be regulated in the same way as AGC-kinase family members. Furthermore, analysis of a range of peptide sequences defines the peptide sequence, RRSSSY, as an efficient and specific substrate for TSSK3. In Chapter 3, we searched for TSSK3 potential regulatory interacting proteins by a yeast two-hybrid approach. We identified, a novel, widely expressed protein, RUSC2 and we showed that it binds to but is not a substrate for TSSK3. We also observed it to be phosphorylated by Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK). Next, we demonstrated that RUSC2 transiently interacts with JNK kinases after oxidative stress treatment and that TSSK3 appears in this stress-induced complex as well. Furthermore we showed that this interaction is abolished by inhibitory mutant of MKK4. In this chapter we pointed out the possible connection between RUSC2, TSSK3 and oxidative stress induced JNK signaling pathway. Chapter 4 describes our search for mutations in two other genes of the TSSK family, TSSK1 and 2, in patients with infertility. We found, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the TSSK2 gene, which changed threonine residue, located in the C-terminal regulatory domain of TSSK2, to methionine (T280M) that may be correlated with spermatogenic failure. Thus, TSSK2 might be a candidate gene for molecular marker for genetic diagnosis of male infertility. In Chapter 5, a model for RUSC2 assembly with TSSK3, JNK and H-Ras is proposed and the possible directions of future studies on TSSK family and their role in signal transduction are discussed\"],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Today, there is an increasing interest in selective and sensitive analysis of proteins and peptides with a relatively high speed. The first chapter of this thesis describes several strategies for the on-line multidimensional analysis of peptides and proteins in biological samples. This overview of the existing approaches to couple on-line different separation techniques for the determination of proteins and peptides includes the more conventional liquid chromatography (LC)-LC coupling, as well as the on-line LC-capillary electrophoresis (CE) coupled systems and the strategies for on-line CE-CE coupling. Special attention is paid to the interface between the dimensions as well as the design of the coupled systems.\\n\\r\\nAn overview of the possibilities of on- or in-line preconcentration procedures in combination with a CE separation, focused on the determination of peptides and proteins, is also included in the thesis (chapter 2). The methods are categorized in electrophoresis-based and chromatography-based preconcentration. \\n\\r\\nThe objective of this thesis is the development of novel on-line multidimensional systems for the separation and quantitation of peptides in biological samples. Two on-line two-dimensional (2D) systems have been developed: a size exclusion chromatography (SEC)-reversed phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) system (chapter 3-4) and a SEC-capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) system (chapter 5-6). In both cases the heart-cut principle is used to isolate in the SEC dimension the fraction, containing six enkephalin peptides as target compounds, from proteins and other interfering substances. This fraction is transferred to the second (RPLC or CZE) dimension and its components are separated. In the SEC-RPLC system a loop is used to transfer the enkephalin-containing fraction, while the SEC-CZE system is based on a new type of interface consisting of trapping of the enkephalins on a micro column and on-line electrokinetic injection of a part of the eluate from this column. Determination of model enkephalins, developed with both systems show satisfactory linearity and intraday precision while the total analysis time is less than 30 min. The concentration limit of detection (CLOD) of both systems, employing UV detection, is in the order of 2-3 μg/mL, which is comparable to other peptide assays based on separation and suitable for the determination and quantitation of a number of peptide drugs with plasma concentrations in the low μg/mL range. Both methods allow the injection of CSF samples without pretreatment. However, due to the limited sensitivity of the methods the concentrations of endogenous enkephalins in plasma and CSF cannot be determined, since these concentrations are at least three orders of magnitude lower than the presented CLOD values. It is therefore necessary to improve the sensitivity of the systems. In the general conclusions of this thesis preliminary experiments with more sensitive detection methods, such as fluorescence and MS detection are described in order to illustrate the possibilities and difficulties of the coupling with these detection modes. Some recommendations are given for the achievement of a higher sensitivity.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Paratuberculosis, or Johne’s disease, is a chronic infection of the small intestine of cattle caused by Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis (M.a.p.) , leading to an incurable form of protein loosing enteropathy. Young animals are orally infected with  M.a.p., which resides and replicates in the macrophages of the gut. After a long period without symptoms, disease develops generally at the age of 4-6 years. Asymptomatic animals shedding bacteria with their feces contribute to infection of other young animals. Due to both difficulties of diagnosis of the disease in an early stage and high resistance of the bacteria against environmental influences, prevention of the disease is difficult. A good vaccine, together with management measures that are currently undertaken, would help in eradicating the disease. \\n\\r\\nBased on the knowledge on other intracellular bacteria, we hypothesized that a vaccine should induce a cytotoxic T cell (CTL) reaction in vaccinated animals. Secondly, we hypothesized that these CTL could be induced by using Heat Shock Protein 70 (Hsp70) of  M.a.p. as a carrier protein to shuttle antigen into the MHC class I pathway. \\n\\r\\nIn a longitudinal study on 20 infected calves we showed that antibody production was related to high frequent shedding of bacteria, while differences in cellular immune reactions between high and low frequent shedders were only detectable early in the study.\\r\\nFor the use of Hsp70 as a CTL inducing protein we investigated if bovine antigen presenting cells (APC) interacted with the recombinant Hsp70 in vitro.  Receptor mediated endocytosis of Hsp70 could be demonstrated, which was related to the type and the maturation stage of the APC (monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells). Interaction of a fusion protein, consisting of the receptor binding domain of Hsp70 fused to enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), with bovine APC could also be demonstrated, which made the fusion protein suitable for immunization of cattle. Recognition of the fusion protein could be demonstrated in vitro with lymphocyte stimulation tests, however, GFP specific CTL activity could not be detected with two different cytotoxicity assays. As dendritic cells (DC) are pivotal in initiating immune reactions, cytokine gene expression profiles of DC incubated with M.a.p., E.coli and Hsp70 were compared at 6 and 24 hours of incubation. Cytokine gene expression was largely similar for incubation with M.a.p.  and E.coli,  resulting mainly in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, while especially IL-12 gene expression was detected later, after 24 hours of incubation only, when DC were incubated with Hsp70. In the last chapter of the thesis the results are discussed with emphasis on Hsp70 as a tool in disease prevention and as a dominant antigen during infection.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Patients with severe haemophilia have a plasma activity level of factor VIII or IX below 1%. Although the laboratory diagnosis of severe haemophilia is distinct, marked variation in bleeding pattern among patients has been observed. Knowledge of indicators and determinants of this variation may enhance the quality of patient care in terms of individualized prophylactic treatment. Individual tailoring of treatment may increase cost-effectiveness of treatment. Karin van Dijk examined bleeding patterns of 285 patients with severe haemophilia at the Van Creveldkliniek. She studied the age at first joint bleed, annual joint bleed frequency, annual clotting factor consumption and arthropathy. In total 4737 patient-years were collected - which is approximately 17 per patient. The median age at first joint bleed was 1.8 years and varied from 2.5 months to 5.8 years. The age at first joint bleed was associated with the use of clotting factor concentrate later in life. Patients who experienced their first joint bleed at an early age had consistently higher annual clotting factor consumption than patients who had their first joint bleed later in life. The age at first joint bleed may therefore be used as an indicator of bleeding pattern.\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe determinants of variation in bleeding pattern are largely unknown. To study determinants of this variation, Van Dijk selected 21 people with a more severe bleeding pattern and 21 with a less severe bleeding pattern. In these, pharmacokinetics, proteins involved in clot formation and -lysis and thrombingeneration were analysed. Furthermore, the effect of the underlying defect in the gene encoding for factor VIII was studied in 241 patients with severe haemophilia. These factors were not, or only to a limited extent, associated with bleeding pattern.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The susceptibility to common psychiatric disorders is largely determined by genetic factors. Knowledge of these factors may give insight into the causes of these disorders, and, more importantly, open new ways for prevention and treatment. Identifying the causal DNA variants, however, has proved to be difficult, despite considerable research efforts. One explanation is that many genes and environmental factors are involved, which would require large study populations to detect variants with modest effects. Some variants may be involved in specific disease symptoms only, or their relative importance could differ between population subgroups. In both cases, detecting such variants would be difficult in unselected, ethnically diverse patient samples.\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis thesis describes genetic studies performed on clinically well-defined, homogeneous groups of Dutch patients suffering from schizophrenia and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and presents novel techniques for efficiently performing such studies.\\r\\nIn a large sample of unrelated schizophrenia patients, we investigated 12 functional candidate genes involved in dopamine neurotransmission. Dopamine dysregulation has long been implicated as a causal factor in schizophrenia, since most of the effective drug treatments block dopamine receptors in the brain. In this study, which was performed using microsatellite markers and pooled DNA from patients and controls, we found no evidence however for a significant contribution to schizophrenia from any of these genes. These results suggest that if dopamine genes are involved in schizophrenia, their role must be small. \\r\\nSchizophrenia has a very diverse clinical presentation and disease course in individual patients, which suggests the existence of disease subtypes with different biological causes. To investigate this possibility, we collected patients with and without the deficit form of schizophrenia. The deficit syndrome is characterized by prominent, enduring negative symptoms, such as decreased interest, social withdrawal and flattened affect. In these groups, we investigated variants in several genes that have recently been implicated in schizophrenia. We found that the neuregulin 1 and RGS4 genes were almost entirely associated with the non-deficit group, which provided genetic support for a distinct aetiology of clinically recognizable forms of schizophrenia. The PIP5K2A gene, which has previously been implicated in bipolar disorder, was strongly associated with both deficit and non-deficit schizophrenia. For several other recently reported genes, such as dysbindin (DTNBP1) and G72/G30, we were able to rule out a substantial role in Dutch schizophrenic patients.\\r\\nIn ADHD, genes from the dopamine system have also been regarded as candidate genes, since the most effective medication blocks the dopamine transporter. We have investigated the dopamine transporter gene (DAT1), as well as the dopamine receptor genes 4 (DRD4) and 5 (DRD5), in a large family sample of Dutch children with ADHD. We found no evidence for association of these genes with the disorder. In the same families with affected pairs of siblings, we have performed one of the first whole-genome linkage studies in ADHD. The results indicated that DNA regions on chromosomes 15q and 7p might contain genes that contribute to the disorder. On chromosome 7, we found no support for involvement of dopa decarboxylase (DDC), a functional candidate gene in the linkage region.\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides specific genetic studies in these two disorders, two techniques are presented for the efficient screening of genetic markers. A new mathematical procedure was developed to correct the so-called stutter artefact in the analysis of microsatellite markers. This method enables the accurate and efficient estimation of microsatellite marker allele frequencies in DNA pools (combined DNA from large groups of individuals, which can be screened for differences between patients and controls). Finally, an inexpensive and efficient method was developed for analyzing single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on standard DNA sequencing equipment.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Radiotherapy is a common treatment for head and neck cancer patients. Unfortunately, it produces serious acute and long-term side effects to the oral cavity. One severe complication is the loss of salivary gland function, which can persists for many years. Saliva has multiple functions relating to speech, taste perception, mastication, and swallowing and bolus formation. Cleansing and dental and mucosal protection are also important functions. In this thesis, a detailed report is given on the effects of radiotherapy on changes in the parotid gland function. Different methods of measuring gland function are described. Moreover, a preventive measure to limit the gland toxicity was investigated in rodents.   \\n\\r\\nThe radiation field and, in particular, the volume of the parotid gland tissue exposed to radiation is of notable importance with regard to the development of gland damage and hypofunction. Therefore, it is important to achieve detailed information about the size and position of the parotid gland. Great differences in size and position of the parotid glands between the patients were seen. In order to exactly define the localisation of the glands, it is essential to use CT-based simulation of radiation fields. \\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe radiation tolerance of the parotid glands as a function of dose and volume irradiated was accurately described. The best parameter for evaluation of the parotid gland function appeared to be the flow measurement using the Lashley cups. However, if direct flow measurements are not feasible, 99mTc-pertechnetate scintigraphy might be a good alternative. Flow reduction depended on the mean parotid gland dose. For a post treatment parotid flow ratio á\\r\\n\\r\\n25%, the TD50 (the dose to the whole organ leading to a complication probability of 50%) was found to be 31, 35 and 39 Gy at 6 weeks, 6 months and 1 year after radiotherapy respectively.\\n\\r\\nThe consequences of parotid gland injury are still difficult to manage. Prophylactic treatment with sialogogues like the muscarinic receptor agonist pilocarpine has been shown to have radioprotective potential. The effects of preirradiation treatment of pilocarpine on rat parotid gland function were investigated in relation to radiation dose. Pilocarpine induced compensation, which at least underlies the radioprotective effect of the drug. This effect seemed to be dependent on the amount of damage induced. Therefore, the type of fractionation scheme and the volume of the gland that lies within the radiation portal will be crucial for the effectiveness of a prophylactic pilocarpine treatment.\\n\\r\\nWith the more detailed knowledge on the dose/volume effects of radiation on parotid function, we can try to focus on sparing the parotid gland function. The prevention of radiation-induced loss of parotid gland function will depend on both optimal sparing radiation therapy techniques and on pharmacological agents, which can selectively interfere with the radiation-induced effects. These preventing strategies will need a joint effort of radiation-oncologists, clinical physicists and radiobiologists.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['LDL receptor-related protein (LRP) is a multifunctional cell surface receptor that is expressed in many cell types. It is able to bind numerous structurally unrelated ligands. This thesis describes four novel functions of LRP in different cell types.\\n\\r\\nβ2-integrins are heterodimeric proteins present at the cell surface of leukocytes. They are involved in various processes, like leukocyte adhesion to the vascular wall. We reported that LRP directly bound to the α-subunit of β2-integrins. Upon activation, β2-integrins form clusters in rafts of monocytes to increase the avidity for its ligands. LRP was co-immunoprecipitated with β2-integrins in the raft fraction of both naïve and stimulated monocytes. In addition, LRP colocalized with β2-integrins in the clusters. Downregulation of LRP disrupted the β2-integrin clusters, which resulted in a decreased adhesion of monocytes to activated endothelium. These data indicate that LRP is required for optimal β2-integrin function.\\n\\r\\nThese results prompted us to explore the functions of LRP in other leukcoytes. Though, cellular expression patterns in lymphocytes have not been fully investigated yet. Our study showed that LRP is present in CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, natural killer (NK) cells and B-cells. We observed a differential localization of LRP in these cells. Whereas it was present at the cell surface of NK cells and B-cells, the total LRP pool was localized intracellularly in both T-cell subtypes. In these cells, LRP could be transported to the cell surface upon a reaction with allogenic monocytes. These data point to a novel role for LRP in immunologically based diseases, like graft-versus-host-disease.\\n\\r\\nIn brain, LRP is a key component in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). It is involved in the uptake of amyloid β (Aβ) precursor protein and in the further processing of it, eventually leading to secretion of β peptides. High β concentrations can lead to the development of AD. The present study showed that β could directly bind to LRP at the cell surface brain endocthelial cells (BECs), with the Aβ40 isoform having a higher affinity than Aβ42. LRP mediated the internalization of β peptides, which were subsequently transported to the blood across the blood-brain barrier. The presence of high concentrations of Aβ decreased LRP levels in BECs, caused by a direction of LRP into the proteasomal degradation pathway. Interestingly, brain LRP levels in mice and patients suffering from AD were also decreased, suggesting LRP to be a new therapeutic target in the challenge of AD.\\n\\r\\nLRP was also involved in the binding and uptake of C4b-binding protein (C4BP), but this uptake resulted in the degradation of C4BP. Mutant C4BP with replacements of their positively charged residues were less efficiently degraded. These residues were also able to bind heparin. We found that heparan sulfate proteoglycans mediated the first step of cellular C4BP binding, which was followed by LRP-mediated degradation. C4BP can also bind anticoagulant factor protein S. Biacore experiments showed that protein S-complexed C4BP was still able to bind to LRP.\\n\\r\\nFuture research may be emphasized on how one single receptor can exert many, distinct functions.'],\n",

       "  'Description': [\"This thesis describes the research that was undertaken to find peripheral markers for epilepsy and ALS. Changes in the glutamatergic system and excitotoxicity are suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of epilepsy and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (chapter 1) and therefore research was focused on proteins important in maintaining low extracellular glutamate concentrations: glutamate transporters (EAATs) and the enzyme glutamine synthetase (GS). \\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHuman blood platelets take-up glutamate in a Na+-dependent manner, suggesting the involvement of EAATs (chapter 2). EAAT2 protein was found in human blood platelets, but uptake in resting platelets can be inhibited only by high concentrations of DHK. EAAT2 is likely to contribute to glutamate uptake in resting human platelets, but possibly other transporters are involved as well. Thrombin activation of blood platelets, involving α-granule secretion, increased glutamate uptake 9-fold. Uptake was DHK sensitive and kinetic studies showed an increase in active transporters. EAAT2 protein was present on α-granules. Thus, the recruitment of EAAT2 from á-granules is most likely the cause of the increase in glutamate uptake. \\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEAAT2 and excitotoxicity have been implicated in the pathogenesis of ALS. Platelets of ALS patients had a normal basal and thrombin-stimulated glutamate uptake and a normal expression of EAAT2 (chapter 3). However, the amount of GS protein in ALS patients' platelets was increased. Thus, GS expression in platelets may provide a blood marker for ALS and for the effectiveness of therapy. \\n\\r\\n\\t\\r\\nAs platelets are cell fragments and have no active transcription and translation, we examined the expression of glutamatergic transcripts in leukocytes (chapter 4). Microarray and PCR analysis showed that leukocytes express a number of genes implicated in glutamatergic signaling, including EAAT1, 2 and 3 and GS. Also GS protein and enzyme activity was demonstrated. GS mRNA was approximately 50% decreased in newly diagnosed epileptic children and after 1.5 years and appeared not to be affected by AED treatment. Thus, leukocyte GS expression seems to be an early marker of epilepsy. \\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo study the possible correlation between blood and brain parameters in TLE, we studied EAAT expression in the hippocampus of animals with experimentally induced TLE, using the juvenile pilocarpine model (chapter 5). Increases in glutamate transporter GLAST and GLT1 protein were found in the hilus (distinctly stained cells) and the stratum lacunosum-moleculare, in animals 2 weeks after the inductions of SE, but not at later time-points. GS protein expression was only examined 2 weeks after SE and was not different from controls. Vimentin staining, a marker for reactive gliosis, was increased in the same regions, suggesting that the changes in GLAST and GLT1 are related to gliosis (chapter 5). These changes might reflect temporary changes in glutamatergic transmission and might be part of the mechanism leading to epilepsy. Using the same rats, leukocyte mRNA expression was quantified also (chapter 6). EAAT1 and EAAT3 transcripts were present in rat leukocytes but were expressed at a level too low for qPCR analysis. GS transcripts were abundantly present in rat leukocytes. QPCR showed no difference in animals after SE. Thus, GS seems not to be a peripheral marker of the epileptogenesis in animals of the juvenile pilocarpine model.\"],\n",

       "  'Description': [\"The main aim of the thesis was to assess the prevalence of heart failure in patients with a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Furthermore, to explore diagnostic strategies (including natriuretic peptides and cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR)) to identify heart failure in COPD patients. Finally, to document common mechanisms and possible interactions in the development of the two syndromes. \\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prevalence of previously unknown heart failure was assessed in 405 patients ≥\\r\\n 65 years with a GP diagnosis of COPD, in a stable phase of their disease. All participants underwent an extensive systematic diagnostic work-up and an expert panel established the presence of heart failure and/or COPD during consensus meetings. Of 405 participating patients with a diagnosis of COPD, 83 (20.5%) had previously unrecognised heart failure (42 patients systolic, and 41 'isolated' diastolic, and none 'isolated' right sided heart failure). In total 244 (60.2%) patients had COPD according to the GOLD criteria; in 50 (20.5%) patients combined with unrecognised heart failure. The prevalence of heart failure in stable COPD patients is therefore about four times as high as in subjects aged 65 years or over in the population at large. \\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIndependent clinical determinants of the presence of concomitant heart failure were a history of ischaemic heart disease, body mass index, laterally displaced apex beat, and heart rate. The ROC-area of this multivariate 'clinical model' with these four predictors was 0.70. The ROC area of amino-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) as a single test was 0.72. Addition of NT-proBNP to the 'clinical model' significantly increased the ROC-area to 0.77 (95% CI 0.71-0.83). Addition of electrocardiography to the 'clinical model' increased  the ROC-area to 0.75 (95% CI 0.69-0.81). Thus, a limited number of easy available items from history and physical examination with addition of NT-proBNP and/or electrocardiography can increase the confidence of the clinician about the presence or absence of concomitant heart failure in patients with stable COPD. \\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a nested-case control study we assessed the diagnostic value of cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging for detecting or excluding heart failure in COPD patients. The diagnostic value of CMR was higher than that of electrocardiography or natriuretic peptide measurements. CMR may serve as an alternative in case of uninterpretable echocardiographic results.\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe reviewed the literature for etiological and pathophysiological pathways that could be involved in the development of heart failure in the presence of COPD or vice versa. The relationship between COPD and heart failure seems multi-factorial, with tobacco smoking as a common etiologic factor. Local and systemic inflammation, and possibly local and systemic atherosclerosis are common pathways. An important starting point for both diseases seems to be dysfunction of the alveolar-capillary membrane, resulting in decreased oxygen diffusion, and (in more severe cases) sympathetic and structural changes in heart and lungs, which could promote the development of COPD and heart failure. At the moment, much of the interrelation between both syndromes is still unknown. \\n\\r\\n\\r\\nConclusion: Clinicians should be aware of the high prevalence of previously unknown heart failure in elderly patients with COPD. Intensified co-operation between general practitioners, pulmonologists and cardiologists is needed in clinical practice and research to extend the diagnostic strategies, further explore common pathways and treatment options, and eventually increase the prognosis of this large patient population.\"],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The studies presented in this thesis have reported on the elicitation of transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations  (TLESRs) in health, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and  postfundoplication. The relationship between the esophageal acid exposure time and the underlying manometric motor mechanisms, especially TLESRs, in non-hernia patients with GERD is examined. Also the effect of fundoplication on esophageal motility, bolus transit across the esophagogastric junction (EGJ)  and intragastric distribution has been evaluated. The studies give new insights into the origin of postoperative dysphagia, odynophagia and dyspepsia. Furthermore, the role of the proximal stomach and the pressure gradient across the EGJ on acid reflux during TLESRs has been assessed with new technical modalities combining three dimensional (3D) ultrasonic imaging, high-resolution topographic manometer and pH-metry. This thesis provides new insights into EGJ physiology, especially on the role of  proximal stomach in TLESR eliciation and on the role of the EGJ pressure gradient on gastroesophageal reflux during a TLESR. In addition, the effect of fundoplication on esophageal and EGJ motility, intragastric distribution, and EGJ transit efficacy has been evaluated. It is now apparent that an altered intragastric distribution plays a pivotal role in the genesis of postfundoplication dyspepsia.  Changes in fundic and EGJ anatomy with fundoplication lead to a different pressure profile across the EGJ thereby preventing esophageal acid reflux during a TLESR and limiting EGJ transit which relates to postoperative dysphagia.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Patients with a poor ovarian response in IVF treatment are known to have low pregnancy rates because of the low number of embryos available at transfer and the high cancellation rate. Many strategies have been suggested to improve the IVF outcome in these patients. However, it will probably be more rewarding to identify those poor responders that will have poor pregnancy prospects in subsequent cycles than to continue the search for stimulation protocols that might improve IVF outcome. \\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo determine the prognosis of a patient with an insufficient response to ovarian hyperstimulation it is clinically useful to discriminate between expected and unexpected poor responders. In expected poor responders the poor response was predicted on the basis of the result of an ovarian reserve test, such as basal FSH and the antral follicle count. As the underlying cause of the poor response in these patients will most likely be a diminished ovarian reserve, alternative stimulation protocols are bound to fail. Continuation of IVF treatment should be discouraged. In contrast, most unexpected poor responders, with normal ovarian reserve tests, will have sufficient ovarian reserve to respond normally in the subsequent cycle. Their cumulative pregnancy rates are not diminished.\\r\\nIn the present thesis it is shown that the commonly used strategy of aggressive stimulation with high doses of gonadotrophins does not improve the IVF outcome of poor responders and should therefore be avoided.\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause the ovarian reserve declines with age, women of 41 years and above are normally not treated with IVF in the Netherlands. However, when women between 41 and 44 years of age were treated with IVF in a research setting, the majority of these patients showed five or more antral follicles on ultrasound. This indicates that the ovarian reserve is still sufficient. The pregnancy rate in IVF in this group was comparable to the pregnancy rate of women aged between 38 and 41 with sufficient follicles. The number of antral follicles therefore is a better predictor of IVF outcome in older women than age. It seems no longer justified to simply deny IVF treatment to all older patients now that it is possible to select a subgroup with a favourable prognosis.'],\n",

In the medical domain, such systems can be equipped with a patient-specific facility that indicates which diagnostic test or combination of tests should be performed. Current systems, however, do not take into account that tests might be ordered in packages rather than one by one. Current systems furthermore do not take into account that physicians would prefer to gather information for a specific purpose, such as the general condition of the patient, prior to gathering information about an other topic, such as for instance the presence or absence of metastases. In this thesis, we describe a automatic test-selection facility we designed that fits better with the daily medical practice than current facilities do. Our facility is capable of selecting diagnostic tests while taking into account the specific characteristics of the patients illness, the characteristics of the test, such as its sensitivity and specificity or its predictive value, and the order in which various different subgoals are investigated by the physicians. It is furthermore able to select multiple tests rather than just one test. By extending a decision-support system with a test-selection facility, the system become more and more interesting to use in the daily medical practice. A decision-support system with a good test-selection facility could lead to ordering fewer tests.

Originally, it was chosen as a vertebrate model system because its excellent properties that allow the study of embryonic development could be combined with powerful genetic analysis. Forward mutagenesis screens have led to the identification of thousands of mutants that are defective in developmental processes. More recent genetic screens have yielded many additional mutants in diverse biological processes, some of which are very reminiscent of human diseases. Great effort is undertaken to identify the genes responsible for these mutant phenotypes. However, the reverse genetic discovery of gene function, by inactivation of genes through knockout technologies, has not been possible in zebrafish until recently. \\n\\r\\nThis thesis describes the establishment of a knockout technology in zebrafish. It describes the creation of the first zebrafish knockout, the rag1 gene, by target-selected mutagenesis. By resequencing a comprehensive library of mutagenized zebrafish, a null mutation in the rag1 gene was identified. This mutation leads to a failure in rearrangement of the immunoglobulin locus and consequently results in immunodefiency. Next, several refinements to this knockout technique are described. Instead of direct resequencing of mutagenized animals, the TILLING technique was used to pre-screen for point mutations in several genes. Using this method, thirteen potential zebrafish knockouts were identified. The current methodologies and potential future applications to do reverse genetic analysis in zebrafish are reviewed.\\n\\r\\nThe other subject of this thesis is 'microRNAs (miRNAs) in zebrafish development’. miRNAs are small non-coding RNA molecules that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression. The base-pairing of miRNAs to target mRNAs results in translational inhibition or mRNA cleavage. Hundreds of miRNAs have been identified in various multicellular organisms and many miRNAs are evolutionarily conserved. Although the biological functions of most miRNAs are unknown, miRNAs are predicted to regulate up to 30% of the genes within the human genome. The recent advances in miRNA biology are reviewed. Particularly, there is a focus on the roles of miRNAs in vertebrate development and disease. The construction and analysis of the dicer knockout in zebrafish is described. Disruption of the miRNA-producing enzyme Dicer results in developmental arrest and failure to produce miRNAs, indicating that miRNAs are essential for vertebrate development. Furthermore, the miRNA expression patterns during zebrafish embryonic development are described. Most miRNA are expressed in a highly tissue-specific manner during segmentation and later stages, but not early in development, which suggests that their role is not in tissue fate establishment but in differentiation or maintenance of tissue identity.\"],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The individual studies, presented in separate chapters of this thesis, were designed to get answers to certain methodological problems and biological questions associated with the myometrial function of early postpartum dairy cows.\\n\\r\\nChapter 1  introduces the topic by briefly summarizing the events occuring in the puerperal uterus, focusing on the role of myometrial contractions, and listing some of the possibilities used to record uterine contractility. The demand for an accurate, non-invasive, intrauterine pressure (IUP) recording and analysis system, for use in postpartum cows kept on dairy farms, is mentioned - as is the need for more physiological data on uterine functioning after normal parturition.\\n\\r\\nChapter 2 reviews the development of techniques for measuring, analyzing and evaluating uterine activity. Changes in IUP during the normal and abnormal bovine postpartum period are detailed in chronological order. Following their previous introduction, the effects of some drugs, used to influence uterine contractility, are reviewed.\\n\\r\\nChapter 3 describes the good correlations between the results from two simultaneous electromyographic (EMG) recordings (using surgically imbedded bipolar electrodes), those from two different IUP recording methods (an open tip catheter and a microtransducer system), as well as those from the above IUP and EMG methods, in cows after induced parturition. It outlines a new digital technique for properly characterizing mechanical activity in the early postpartum bovine uterus even under on-farm circumstances, based on low-cost, disposable IUP recording units, which utilize a transcervically introduced, non-invasive method for fixation of the IUP measuring units (the  \"virtual knot\"), and especially developed acquisition and analyzing softwares with a post-measurement filtering capability.\\n\\r\\nChapter 4 describes the successful application of a digital non-invasive, open tip catheter system to quantifying IUP changes in untreated, healthy, postpartum cows under on-farm conditions. While showing considerable individual variability, the mean frequency (FREQ), amplitude (AMP) and area under the curve (AUC) values for the myometrial contractions decreased continuously and significantly during the first 48 hours postpartum, with the largest decline occurring between 12 and 24 hours. The IUP values showed no significant correlations with blood Ca2+-concentrations.\\n\\r\\nUsing the above system, the uterotonic effects of a single intramuscular treatment with oxytocin (50 IU) or carbetocin (0.35 mg), 14 to 16 hours after normal parturition, are examined in Chapter 5. These treatments were similarly effective, almost identical in enhancing uterine contractility. In each case, FREQ and total area under the curve (TAUC) showed a significant short-term treatment effect (until 4 h after treatment) - peaking during the 1st post-treatment hour, and returning to the initial levels during the 3rd hour. Other parameters (AMP, DUR /duration/ and AUC) were not affected. None of the IUP parameters revealed any significant effect in the long-term analysis (12 to 36 hours post-treatment) due to any of these treatments.\\n\\r\\nChapter 6 details an investigation into oxytocin-induced prostaglandin release - as characterized by plasma 15-ketodihydroprostaglandin-F2α concentrations. Intramuscular treatment with a therapeutical dose of oxytocin (50 IU) between 13 and 15 hours after calving did not significantly alter prostaglandin release. However, administering the oxytocin on two cows intravascularly, did provide evidence of an oxytocin-induced prostaglandin synthesis. It is hypothesized that, although the quantity of released prostaglandins appearing in the peripheral circulation after an intramuscular oxytocin treatment seems to be too small to be detected, it may have an indirect effect through the stimulation of a local prostaglandin synthesis and release, making an additional contribution to the direct uterotonic effect of oxytocin.\\n\\r\\nChapter 7 summarizes and generally discusses the previous chapters in the context of the most current knowledge available in the literature, listing the main outcomes and conclusions of the thesis.'],\n",

       "  'Description': [\"The laboratory rat is one of the most studied model organisms for human heath and disease. Researchers have developed many inbred strains that specifically mimic aspects of human genetic disease, like hypertension, diabetes, and neurological disorders, like anxiety, schizophrenia, and many others. The development of such models largely depends on the amount of natural occurring variation. In this thesis, I describe a method to induce genetic variation in the rat and discover the newly induced mutations. Using this method, called target-selected mutagenesis or TILLING, we developed mutant rats and more importantly, knockout rats, harboring a mutation that abolishes gene function in a directed way.\\n\\r\\n Besides inducing genetic variation, I also describe studies on naturally occurring genetic variation. Since inbred rat strains are specifically selected to mimic certain aspects of a human genetic disease, it is of importance to gain insight in the genetic variation that may cause this disease. Therefore, we sampled genetic variation in coding regions of over 50 rat genes in 96 commonly used inbred strains. In addition, we studied variation in wild rats, caught in The Netherlands and compared this to laboratory strains. We found that 84 percent of wild rat alleles was still represented in a set of 36 commonly used rat strains, illustrating that rat strains are descending from a limited founder population of domesticated wild rats relatively recently. Moreover, we postulate that wild rat-based shotgun sequencing is an efficient approach to discover novel genetic variation in the rat. Despite the advances reported in this thesis, we are still at the beginning of full understanding of the function of the mammalian genome. Even if we know the exact sequence variation in each rat model, we still don't know which of the sequence variants is functionally important for establishment of the disease. Therefore, the need for development of genetic experiments for the rat is inevitable, as described in the Introduction.\"],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The limit therapeutic effect of traditional therapeutic approaches against breast cancer (BC) compels to search for new effective anti-BC therapies and to develop appropriate prognostic systems to predict BC patient outcome before therapy application. Therefore, first, we studied the prognostic value of several hematological and serum biochemical parameters to predict mammary carcinoma growth rate in a mouse model and the effect of IL-2 therapy. Then two therapy modes were tested in original mouse models, namely immunotherapy by means of local IL-2 and lectin aimed cytotoxic therapy. These studies are usually hampered by the lack of proper mouse models for BC. Therefore, an original system of spontaneous mouse models with various incidences of multiple mammary/ovary/uterine epithelial lesions and lymphoma in the BLRB, BYRB, and CBRB strains has been developed. The characteristics of all three strains as general mouse models for familial BC are presented. \\n\\r\\nThe results of local IL-2 therapy in human BC are not clear yet.  This kind of immunotherapy is first of all aimed to augment the anti-cancer response of T/NK cells. However, these cells are not frequent among BC infiltrating mononuclear cells. Our data in mouse models were in general in accordance with these findings suggesting that only a distinct proportion of MC bearing recipients, namely those with tumors with prevailed T/NK cells within tumor infiltrate, might benefit from immunotherapy. Indeed, using an original \"proper subgrouping approach\" both beneficial and non-beneficial recipient subgroups were found within IL-2 treated mice in spontaneous and transplanted models. Therefore, specific aim of this dissertation was to make obvious the need of a selection procedure development for recipients.\\r\\nBeing interested in a rational design of carbohydrate-based lectin aimed therapeutics against BC we have developed synthetic glycoconjugates as diagnostic tools to identify lectins and used them for targeted delivery of a therapeutic. In particular, we developed cytotoxic melphalan bearing liposomes equipped with lipophilic tetrasaccharide SiaLex (synthetic selectin ligand) as a vector and demonstrated a promising therapeutical effect of this drug formulation in the transplantable BLRB mouse mammary carcinoma model. \\n\\r\\nEndogenous lectins, including galectins, play an important role in the in breast cancer cells during progression and in metastasis. So, they are attractive targets for lectin aimed anti-breast cancer therapy. Therefore, we studied galectin expression on MC cells from a variety of mouse models from our collection and showed that galectins are present on the MC cell surface of all mouse models tested. Moreover, galectin expression profiles detected in various mouse models in vitro and during spontaneous MC progression in vivo were similar to findings in human BC lines and specimens. These data validate our mouse model system composed of several complementary models which mimic various aspects of BC as useful tool to test novel target cytotoxic therapeutical protocols to prevent MC growth (i) directly, aimed to galectins on MC cells and (ii) indirectly, aimed to selectins expressed on endothelial cells of newly arisen tumor vascularity, or (iii) using both approaches to target \"hot spots\" of MC growth.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Understanding the complex cellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate the immune response remains one of the major challenges in immunology. A key question is how the immune system is regulated in order to control a protective immune response and prevent chronic and destructive immunopathology. Within the adaptive immune system CD4+ T cells are keyplayers in the initiation and orchestration of immune responses. However, there is now increasing evidence that subsets of CD4+ T cells are also important negative regulators. Amongst these, the so-called naturally occurring CD4+CD25+ Tregs and IL-10 producing Tr1 cells are the best characterized. The ability of regulatory T cells (Tregs) to control many facets of the immune response suggests that they might be used as targets for new therapeutic strategies. \\n\\r\\nIn the first part of this thesis we explored the presence and functionality of different subsets of Tregs in Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA). We identified and characterized self heat shock protein 60 (HSP60) specific T cells (chapter 2) and we studied the frequency, phenotype and functionality of naturally occurring CD4+CD25+ Tregs in JIA patients (chapter 3). Subsequently, we explored the role of human HSP60 in the induction and function of CD4+CD25+ Tregs using PBMC of healthy controls and tried to further classify the human HSP60 specific T cells (chapter 4). In the second part of this thesis we evaluated the safety and effectiveness of Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation (ASCT) for refractory JIA by studying 34 JIA patients transplanted in 9 different transplantation centers within Europe (chapter 5). Furthermore, we explored the mechanisms that are attributable to the induction of tolerance by ASCT and identified CD4+CD25+ Tregs as one of the keyplayers in this induction (chapter 6). \\n\\r\\nTaken together the studies described in this thesis may contribute to our understanding of the pathophysiology of JIA as well as of the physiology of regulatory immune responses in general. We identified different subsets of Tregs as crucial players in the tolerization process. Furthermore, it identified human HSP60 being the first known physiological human antigen, naturally present at inflammatory sites and able to activate Tregs. This knowledge may be pivotal in designing the new immunoregulatory strategies for JIA and other autoimmune diseases.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) plays a pivotal role in fertility and reproduction in mammals. It induces the release of luteinising hormone (LH) en follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) from the pituitary. These hormones are responsible for gonadal steroid production and indirectly for gametogenesis. \\n\\r\\nIn this thesis, studies are presented which described the development of a highly immunogenic GnRH antigen, as well as the evaluation of this antigen in vaccines in target species. The native GnRH peptide was enlarged to a GnRH-tandem peptide and immunogenicity was further increased by dimerization of the peptide and introduction of foreign amino acids (G6k-GnRH-tandem-dimer). This modified peptide construct was conjugated to ovalbumine. It appeared to be highly effective in immunosterilization, i.e. blocking testosterone production, in male piglets. \\n\\r\\nThe role of the individual amino acids of the G6k-GnRH-tandem-dimer on immunosterilization efficacy was established, using alanine replacements. All amino acids, except amino acids at position 2 and 3, could be individually replaced by alanine without affecting efficacy of the vaccine. Peptides with alanine replacements at position 1 or 4 did induce antibodies that were specific for GnRH and did not cross-react with other GnRH-isoforms present in mammals.\\n\\r\\nImmunosterilization by vaccination against GnRH could be a suitable alternative for surgical castration in male piglets. Surgical castration prevents boar taint, but is an animal unfriendly practice, as it is performed without anaesthesia. Immunosterilization may also be beneficial for growth performance. Effects of the time of onset of effective immunosterilization on growth performance were studied. Effective immunosterilization early during the fattening period resulted in a growth performance similar to surgical castrates. In contrast, when immunosterilization was initiated late during the fattening period, growth performance was improved over surgical castrates and carcass quality appeared to be similar to intact male pigs. In addition, immunosterilized pigs of both groups could easily be distinguished from intact male pigs by the size of their testes. \\n\\r\\nTwo vaccines with the G6k-GnRH-tandem-dimer antigen in CoVaccine and Carbopol adjuvant were evaluated in sexually mature male ponies. The CoVaccine-treated stallions showed a high antibody response after the second vaccination, subsequently leading to undetectable testosterone levels and affected testis function, while effects in the Carbopol group were only present in one of the four stallions treated.\\n\\r\\nIn humane medicine, GnRH vaccination could be an alternative for hormone therapy in prostate cancer patients. Two potential vaccines with the antigen in ISA 51 and in CoVaccine adjuvant were studied in pigs. The latter vaccine appeared to be more effective. It reduced testosterone levels, weights of testes and accessory sex glands in all treated animals. Both vaccines can be considered as non-toxic; no chronic abnormalities were observed in blood, urine, organs or tissues.\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion, this vaccine could be a suitable alternative for surgical castration in pigs, eventually leading to a ban on this animal unfriendly practice in the EU. In human medicine, GnRH vaccination could replace hormone therapy in diseases driven by gonadal steroids. In prostate cancer for instance, GnRH vaccination may be a long term effective, cheap and safe alternative.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Liposomal targeting of glucocorticoids : a novel treatment approach for inflammatory disorders'],\n",
       "  'Description': [\"Glucocorticoids can be highly effective in a wide range of inflammatory disorders e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel diseases and psoriasis. However, their application in systemic treatment approaches is limited due to a high incidence of serious adverse effects, especially related to long-term treatment. In addition it is generally assumed that - contrary to the so-called 'disease modifying anti-arthritic drugs' - glucocorticoids only suppress the inflammatory process, leaving the progression of disease-related tissue damage unaffected.\\n\\r\\n Two aspects can be regarded critical for the efficacy-safety issues related to systemic glucocorticoid treatment. First, the unfavorable pharmacokinetic behavior of glucocorticoids upon intravenous administration, which is characterized by rapid clearance in combination with a large volume of distribution. Therefore high and frequent dosing is often necessary to achieve an effective concentration of glucocorticoid at inflamed target sites. Combined with the second aspect, namely the profound physiological actions of glucocorticoids in many different tissues, this explains the high risk of occurrence of serious adverse effects.\\r\\nA drug-targeting approach may be employed to increase the efficacy/safety ratio.  One of the most interesting carriers for drug-targeting in inflammatory disorders is the long-circulating liposome system. Long-circulating liposomes are small lipid bilayer vesicles with an aqueous interior that can be used to entrap water-soluble agents. Often water-soluble polymers like poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) are attached to the surface of these liposomes to reduce adhesion of plasma proteins that would otherwise induce recognition and rapid removal from the circulation by macrophages in liver and spleen. Studies with radiolabels entrapped in long-circulating liposomes have indicated that they can selectively extravasate in sites of pathology (inflammatory tissue and tumors), by virtue of increased permeability of the vascular endothelium at these sites.\\n\\r\\nThis thesis describes the studies that have been performed to evaluate whether the approach of drug targeting can improve delivery and therefore the efficacy of glucocorticoids in inflammatory disorders. We studied pharmacokinetics, tissue distribution, target localization and therapeutic activity of glucocorticoid-PEG-liposomes in both rat and murine experimental arthritis as well as rat and murine experimental encephalomyelitis. The results of these studies indicate that liposomal encapsulation can dramatically increase the therapeutic efficacy of glucocorticoids in inflammatory disorders. A single injection of 10 mg/kg liposomal prednisolone for instance, resulted in complete reversal of the evoked exacerbation of inflammation for almost a week. In contrast, an equal dose unencapsulated prednisolone was hardly effective. Only a weak effect was observed after repeated daily injections. Our mechanistic studies indeed pointed to increased activity as a result of enhanced accumulation of glucocorticoid at sites of inflammation, realized by virtue of the long-circulating liposomal formulation.\\n\\r\\nIn addition to the therapeutic use in experimental inflammatory disorders, we explored the therapeutic potential of long-circulating glucocorticoid-liposomes in experimental tumor models. Glucocorticoids have been reported to be active in some experimental cancers, however the effects were controversial and required extreme high and toxic doses. Surprisingly, in different murine experimental tumors we found a profound (> 90%) growth inhibition was found after a single dose of liposomal prednisolone. Histological studies revealed the occurrence of cell death among the majority of the tumor cells and showed a marked effect on the capacity of the tumor to invade healthy tissue. The beneficial effect of our liposomal approach may relate to the ability of long-circulating liposomes to selectively deliver the encapsulated glucocorticoid to tumor-associated inflammatory cells, preventing the tumor to utilize inflammation-driven neovascularization and matrix-degradation for its growth.\\r\\nIn conclusion, the studies that are described in this thesis point at a dramatic improvement of the therapeutic value of glucocorticoids when incorporated in long-circulating liposomes as targeting vehicles. These findings may offer perspective in both the field of chronic inflammatory disorders as well as in oncology.\"],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Ageing is characterised by a reduction in physical reserve, the physiological capacity in excess of that needed for daily activities, that provides a margin of safety that absorbs age- or disease-related changes without a loss in function. When physical capacity falls below the ability required for the performance of daily tasks, functional limitations and a loss of independence may occur. Approximately 20% of people between 65 and 75 years of age report problems with activities of daily living (ADLs), a proportion which increases to 48% in people older than 85. \\r\\n\\r\\nExercise studies and exercise promotion for older adults offer the potential for improving the performance of daily activities and quality of life. However, the results of current exercise programmes are limited and inconsistent. The University Medical Center (UMC) Utrecht developed an exercise programme focusing on functional tasks of everyday life, tasks that are affected early in the ageing process. The aim of the studies described in this thesis was to study the difference in effect between functional tasks exercises and resistance strength exercises on the physical functional performance and health-related quality of life of older community-dwelling women.\\r\\n\\r\\nA pilot study with 24 community-dwelling, medically stable women (mean age 74.6 ?4.8) demonstrated that both exercise programmes were feasible and well tolerated by women over the age of 70 years and living in the community.\\r\\n\\r\\nNinety-eight healthy women aged 70 and older were randomly assigned to either the function group (n = 33), the resistance group (n = 34) or a control group (n = 31). Participants attended exercise classes three times a week for 12 weeks. Functional task performance (ADAP test), isometric knee extensor strength (IKES), handgrip strength, isometric elbow flexor strength (IEFS) and leg extension power were measured at baseline, at the end of training (at 3 months) and 6 months after the end of training (at 9 months). The ADAP assessment of daily activity performance (ADAP) test includes 16 common tasks, such as transferring laundry and boarding a bus, performed at maximal effort. proved to be reliable and valid for measuring the performance of daily activities by community-dwelling older women.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ADAP total score increased more in the function group than in the resistance group or the control group. The ADAP total score of the resistance group did not change compared with the control group. In contrast, IKES and IEFS increased significantly in the resistance group compared with the function group and the control group. Six months after the end of training, the increase in ADAP scores were sustained in the function group, whereas the strength gains of the resistance group had disappeared. Physical activity scores demonstrated that functional tasks exercises may positively influence daily habits more than resistance training, which means that older individuals may continue exercising and thus maintain the effects of exercise. Functional tasks exercises are more effective in improving physical functional performance than common resistance strength exercises and the effects are preserved for longer than the gain in muscle strength achieved with resistance exercises.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['In the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis, based on the respons to injury mechanism, the pathophysiological phenomenons endothelial dysfunction and inflammation are playing a pivitol role. \\n\\r\\nEndothelial dysfunction is characterized by a shift towards reduced vasodilation, a pro-inflammatory state, and pro-thrombic properties. Endothelial dysfunction is associated with most forms of cardiovascular disease such as hypertension, coronary artery disease, chronic heart failure, peripheral artery disease, diabetes, and chronic renal failure. Furthermore the severity of endothelial dysfunction has been shown to have prognostic value for cardiovascular events.\\n\\r\\nEvidence that atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease emerged when pathologic studies showed that T-lymphocytes and macrophages are present in the shoulder regions of atherosclerotic plaques in individuals who died from acute myocardial events. Subsequent studies implicated a multitude of pro-inflammatory targets that appear to be involved in atherogenesis, atherosclerosis and plaque rupture. \\n\\r\\nIn the current thesis we explored several aspects of the described model of vascular injury in the setting of type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is emerging as a worldwide epidemic and currently about 200 million people are affected worldwide. An important cause for this increased incidence is the associated increase in patients with insulin resistance (approximately 400 million worldwide right now). Insulin resistance is driven by central obesity and is secondary to free fatty acid fluxes towards muscle and liver. Several risk factors such as glucose intolerance, hyperinsulinemia, obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, but also endothelial dysfunction and inflammation, have been found to cluster and often precede type 2 diabetes mellitus. Seeing the importance for primary prevention of early identification, the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) of the US created in 2001 a readily applicable definition for daily clinical practice for this cluster of metabolic abnormalities, often referred to as the metabolic syndrome. Although a pathophysiological construct seems plausible, future research must unrevel pathophysiology and clinical use before the metabolic syndrome can be designated as a ‘syndrome’. The individual components that make up the syndrome should be treated coherently. These are the end-sites of the vascular tree. However other risk factors act like trunk of this vascular tree. Awareness of the underlying disorders is important for understanding the pathophyiology and thus coherent treatment: be aware for insulin resistance and its associated (non-) traditional risk factors like endothelial dysfunction and inflammation. \\n\\r\\nThe discovery of nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) and subsequent insight into their role in several metabolic pathways was a major breakthrough in the understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the insulin resistance syndrome. The Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) as a drug subclass are PPAR-γ agonists that have been exhaustively shown to improve peripheral (predominantly skeletal muscle) insulin sensitivity in both animals and humans. In addition to their effects on insulin sensitivity, TZDs have demonstrated both direct and indirect vascular effects, including improved endothelial function, decreased vascular inflammation, lowered plasma FFA levels, improved LDL phenotype, and inhibition of VSMC proliferation. The TZDs have been demonstrated to reduce elevations in blood pressure and microalbuminuria and to improve fibrinolysis with consequent reversal of the procoagulant state. \\n\\r\\nRecently in the first Prospective Pioglitazone Clinical Trial in Macrovascular Events (PROACTIVE) pioglitazone treatment reduced the relative risk for the combined endpoint death, myocardial infarction, and stroke with 16%. Other trials, like RECORD, CHICAGO, and PERISCOPE, are planned to report in 2007.\\n\\r\\nSeveral issues concerning TZD treatment are yet to be resolved. The apparent paradox of adipocyte differentiation with weight gain concurring with the insulin-sensitising effects of TZDs is not completely understood. The TZD-induced decrease in blood pressure accompanied by an increase in the plasma volume has not been fully explained but make the TZDs contra-indicated for patients with heart failure. An important issue that needs to be resolved is the importance of raised cholesterol levels, in particular raised LDL levels, caused by rosiglitazone. Future research may provide answers to these questions, particularly with respect to the role of PPAR-γ, but also PPAR-α, in vascular pathophysiology.

       "  'Title': ['The Bordetella pertussis protein Pertactin: role in immunity and immune evasion'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Pertussis is a highly contagious infectious disease of the respiratory tract which is caused by Bordetella pertussis. Before widespread introduction of vaccination against pertussis, almost every child contracted pertussis. The disease is most severe in neonates and children under the age of 1. Introduction of mass vaccination reduced the number of pertussis cases significantly and resulted in a 10-fold decrease in pertussis mortality in the Netherlands in the late 1950s. Despite vaccination, pertussis remained endemic. A major epidemic occurred in the Netherlands in 1996. Since the 1996 outbreak, the Netherlands now has an epidemic pertussis cycle with peaks every 2 to 3 years during the last decade. Also in several other European countries, as well as Canada, The United States and Australia, a re-emergence of pertussis was observed. Several explanations were proposed for the sudden increase of pertussis in the Netherlands including waning immunity in adolescents and adults, increased reporting, improved diagnosis of the disease and the adaptation of the B. pertussis population. In the Netherlands, pathogen adaptation has probably played an important role in the resurgence of pertussis. Vaccine adapted strains showed polymorphisms in two proteins implicated in protective immunity: P.69 Prn and Ptx. The role of P.69 Prn in protective immunity has been well documented in both humans and in animal models. Furthermore, P.69 Prn is present in several of the currently most used ACVs. \\n\\r\\nUntil recently, relatively little was known about the antibody response to P.69 Prn, the location of epitopes on P.69 Prn and the role of variation in Prn on immune evasion. Variation in the variable region1 was described to affect the Ab response to this region, but no direct evidence or a feasible mechanism for immune evasion was described. The goal of this thesis was to identify the location of (protective) epitopes to which human Abs are directed, and to investigate the role of variation in P.69 Prn and the implications for the anti-P.69 Prn Ab response.\\n\\r\\nOur results clearly indicate that Prn has evolved several ways to escape antibody and possibly phage binding. We showed that the N-terminus of P.69 Prn harbors important epitopes. Furthermore, our data suggests that the variable region1 has evolved to hide those important epitopes from immune recognition and possibly phage binding. In addition, Prn has several other flexible (and variable) loops that are employed to hide adjacent epitopes from the immune system (epitope masking). The N- and C-termini of P.69 Prn interact physically, which results in the masking of a part of Prn. Since the C-terminus has a linear structure that folds towards the N-terminus, it is likely that the Ab response to this region is less efficient then an Ab response directed to the conformational epitopes located in parts of the molecule that are covered by the C-terminus (conformational masking). The loops that are exposed, e.g. region1, region2, and several other loops, were shown to be highly variable (antigenic variation). We showed that deletion of the variable regions does not improve protection against infection. Apparently deletion of the decoy regions does not automatically skew the Ab response towards the conserved protective epitopes. However, we have shown that it is possible to employ synthetic peptides to induce a protective response towards conserved and protective epitopes. \\n\\r\\nThe results presented in this thesis have shed new light on the mechanisms employed by bacteria, and B. pertussis in particular, to evade immune recognition. These results will facilitate the development of new, possibly synthetic, but mainly more effective vaccines.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma susceptibility genes in the HLA region'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['The Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) region on the short arm of chromosome 6 includes the classical HLA genes and in addition HLA-related and non-HLA related genes. The majority of the genes located in this region are directly or indirectly involved in the immune response. The polymorphic HLA molecules, encoded by the HLA genes, bind endogenous and exogenous peptides. Stable bound peptides are recognized by CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, which elicit a humoral or cytotoxic immune response to pathogens. The immunological function of HLA molecules in transplantation has been widely studied. The role of HLA in autoimmune disease and cancer however is less obvious. In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) aberrant HLA expression patterns have been observed on primary tumour cells and lymph node metastases, suggesting an aberrant immune response. Whether the aberrant expression resides in the HLA genes themselves or is as a result of other genes within the HLA region is poorly understood. This thesis describes how the HLA region on the short arm of chromosome 6 is associated with the pathogenesis of HNSCC. \\n\\r\\nAssociations with particular HLA-B alleles and HLA-B-DRB1 haplotypes were identified. However, since few patients carried these alleles and haplotype, this could not be the primary risk factor for the pathogenesis of HNSCC. The MICA gene is in linkage disequilibrium with HLA-B and involved in the innate and adaptive immune system. Allelic polymorphism for the MICA gene was evaluated with a refined method for determination of MICA allele polymorphism based upon the combination of nucleotide polymorphisms in exons 2, 3 and 4 and repeat polymorphism in exon 5. No differences in MICA allelic polymorphism were identified between patients and controls. Repeat length polymorphism, present in the MICA transmembrane region and encoded by exon 5, revealed a significant decrease in the frequency for the MICA-A9 repeat in the patients. Analysis of MICA protein expression indicated that the majority of tumours expressed MICA. The expression of MICA was not correlated with the length of the repeat present in the transmembrane region. To evaluate the role of non-HLA related genes, located within the HLA region and which confer susceptibility to HNSCC, disease-associated regions were defined using microsatellite analysis in pooled DNA analysis. Microsatellite analysis revealed three associated regions, one in the class I region and two in the class II region. From the associated regions 18 genes were selected and evaluated for their RNA expression in tumour tissue compared to surrounding healthy tissue. MICA RNA expression was significantly increased in tumour tissue while a significant decrease in RNA expression was observed for hydroxysteroid (17-beta) dehydrogenase 8 (HSD17B8) in tumour tissue. For retinoid X receptor β (RXRß) and NOTCH4 a decreased, but non-significant, RNA expression in tumour tissue was observed. These results show that apart from HLA genes also other genes in the HLA region are associated with the pathogenesis of HNSCC.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Regulation of proteoglycan-specific immune responses in arthritis'],\n",
       "  'Description': [\"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease characterized by chronic synovial inflammation. Many cells of the immune system are involved in this chronic inflammatory process. The primary target organs are the joints although as the disease progresses systemic manifestations often also appear. As a consequence of the inflammatory process, RA patients generally develop a progressive loss of cartilage and bone in joints, resulting in painful joints and impaired functional status. Understanding the immune-pathogenic development of RA is a crucial step toward improving its management. In this thesis we focused on two major points: gaining more insight into the immune-pathogenic mechanisms underlying RA and investigating the possible anti-inflammatory role of HSP70. \\n\\r\\n\\tIn order to study arthritis, we made use of the proteoglycan-induced arthritis (PGIA) model in BALB/c mice, which is a T cell-dependent, autoantibody-mediated progressive relapsing autoimmune model resembling many characteristics of RA. Originally PGIA was induced by four PG immunizations of which the first and fourth injection were in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) and the second and third PG injection in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA). In chapter 2 (published in Arthritis & Rheumatism 2004;50(5):1665-76) we described that by replacing the Freund's adjuvants by dimethyldioctadecylammonium bromide (DDA), arthritis can be induced by only two PG immunizations. Although the clinical and immunological features of the “classic” form of PGIA are preserved, the onset of the disease is faster and the severity is increased. An additional advantage is that hereby all undesired side effects of the Freund's adjuvants, such as the role of interfering immune responses induced by microbial HSPs present in CFA, are eliminated. DDA exerted a strong stimulatory effect via the activation of innate immunity and forced the immune response toward Th1 dominance (chapter 2). In the PGIA model using DDA as adjuvant, we explored the anti-inflammatory capacity of immune responses to HSP70 in arthritis and searched for the mechanisms involved (chapter 3, manuscript submitted). HSP70 pretreatment dramatically suppressed the development of inflammation and subsequent tissue damage in PGIA. Moreover, HSP70 pretreatment resulted in a regulatory immune response not only to HSP70 but also to PG. To better understand the role of T cells in arthritis we generated a T cell receptor transgenic (TCR-Tg) mouse (chapter 4, accepted Journal of Autoimmunity and chapter 5, manuscript submitted). The T cells of this mouse are specific for an epitope (designated 5/4E8) in the G1 domain of human cartilage PG (amino acids 70-84). These TCR-5/4E8-Tg mice are a unique source of naïve antigen-specific T cells that are capable of inducing progressive chronic arthritis, both spontaneously (<15%), and after immunization with PG (100%) and upon adoptive transfer to BALB/c.SCID mice. Based upon the clinical and histopathological features and the autoimmune aspects shared between PGIA and RA, we believe that these TCR-5/4E8-Tg mice are a valuable tool for further analysis of the mechanisms associated with the initiation and pathogenesis of autoimmune arthritis; and more specifically, for the analysis of the role of antigen specific T cells in disease development. \\n\\r\\n\\tAs in PGIA, T cell responses against cartilage PG do also occur in RA, at least in a subset of patients. In chapter 6 (manuscript in preparation) we tested for responses to several PG epitopes in longstanding RA patients compared to osteoarthritis (OA) patients and healthy controls. In particular, two epitopes (amino acids 16-39 and 263-282; both located in the G1 domain of human PG) appeared to be frequently recognized RA and OA patients as shown by proliferation and preferential Th1 cytokine production. This indicates that PG-specific responses might be involved in RA immune pathogenesis either primarily or, more likely, as a consequence of cartilage destruction. \\n\\r\\n\\tTaken together, PG-specific immune responses were studied in PGIA as well as in RA and showed that the PGIA model provides a unique opportunity to study possible autoimmune mechanisms. Pretreatment with HSP70 showed the potential to modulate (suppress) the arthritogenic effect of PG via IL-10 mediated response and thus to treat arthritis. \\n\\r\\nRA is a complex autoimmune disease controlled by various cells of innate and adaptive immunities, environmental factors and genetic components. A successful treatment of RA will depend on the early diagnosis and a better understanding of pathological processes. The PGIA model enabled the investigation of several in vivo mechanisms in a complex system of inflammation and autoimmunity. The analysis of PGs and HSPs, both present at the site of inflammation, provided insight into the pathogenesis of autoimmunity and arthritis and suggests that both proteins may be targets of immunomodulation by different mechanisms.\"],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Risks and risk-analysis for the development of pressure ulcers in surgical patients'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['With prevalence figures of 13% for university hospitals and 23% for general hospitals, pressure ulcers are a major health care issue in The Netherlands. Pressure ulcers in surgical patients are frequently encountered, as is illustrated by reported incidence rates up to 66%. The number of patients at risk will probably also grow, due to an ageing population. In an extensive review of literature on pressure ulcers in ICU patients, figures on pressure ulcer prevalence and incidence are presented that are 2-3 times higher than those for “average hospital” patients. Also many risk factors for pressure ulcer development are identified. Furthermore, it was concluded that most existing risk assessment scales are not specifically developed for use in an ICU population and that new scales are generally modifications of existing versions and are not properly validated.\\n\\r\\n In a prospective clinical study in 204 patients, 31 possible risk factors were correlated with the actual development of pressure ulcers in postoperative ICU patients. There was a high cumulative incidence of pressure ulcers of 53%, of which 21% were grade 2 or higher. Four independent predictors for the development of pressure ulcers grade 1 or worse were identified: sex, age, duration of anaesthesia and the occurrence of intraoperative complications. In 80% of the patients, the first manifestations of pressure ulcers were present by the third postoperative day, indicating that the operating table is often the basis for pressure ulcers.\\n\\r\\n In a randomized clinical study, tissue-interface pressure measurements were performed during a surgical procedure in 80 patients, comparing four different operating table surfaces. High interface pressures were very common, even on special pressure-relieving support surfaces.\\r\\n Interface pressure measurements were also performed on three support surfaces for the immobilization of trauma patients in an emergency department. This study was conducted in healthy volunteers. Extremely high interface pressures, exceeding 170 mmHg for the sacral area, were found on the spineboard, which is currently the standard surface for immobilization and transportation of trauma patients in The Netherlands. To what extent external pressure influences tissue perfusion and thus tissue oxygenation at deeper levels, was studied using Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS). Oxygen saturation (StO2) was measured in soft tissues overlying the sacral area of 33 volunteers under different external pressures. The results showed that there was a wide inter-individual variability in StO2 course and very poor reproducibility of measurements. NIRS seems not useful for assessing tissue oxygenation in pressure ulcer research.\\n\\r\\n Pressure-relieving surfaces play an important role in the prevention of pressure ulcers. In a randomized clinical study, three high-specification pressure-relieving mattresses were compared. A total of 306 patients with a hospital stay of at least 5 days were included. The overall incidence of grade 2 or worse pressure ulcers was 5.9%, without significant differences in incidence between the three mattresses. This study suggested that standard high-specification mattresses may result in a lower incidence of pressure ulcers in surgical patients. In conclusion, this thesis has demonstrated that the pressure ulcer problem is still highly relevant in surgical and ICU patients.'],\n",

       "  'Description': [\"Introduction: Different clinical studies have shown that transfusion of stored platelets results in better haemostasis in patients with thrombocytopenia with and without a platelet function defect. \\n\\r\\nObjectives: Current preservation procedures aim to optimally preserve the metabolic status of platelets during prolonged storage at 4°C. Currently most Blood banks isolate and store platelet concentrates (PC's) at 22°C. Working at room temperature, has several advantages. It is obviously very simple, and the survival of PC's post transfusion is higher than with chilled-rewarmed PLTs. These advantages are useful when the blood banks and hospitals have enough patients to use freshly isolated PC's immediately. However, there is never a so called 'demand-supply balance' between the blood banks and hospitals. When more PC's are supplied than demanded, blood banks have to store PC's for sometime.\\n\\r\\nStorage at room temperature has also dis-advantages. Currently, with PC's stored at room temperature for more than 5 days there is the problem of microbial multiplication.  This is the reason that so that the FDA limits the storage time to less than 5 days. Another pitfall of storage at room temperature is that it introduces changes in platelets indicative for premature activation, and in GPIb damages and initiation of apoptosis. Improvements have been sought in lowering the storage temperature to below 4°C (in the presence of glucose) but this treatment severely reduces the survival of transfused platelets. A main feature of platelet chilling-rewarming is the gradual increase in the sphere to disc shape change, actin assembly, a gradual increase in [Ca2+]i concomitant with spontaneous agglutination, insensitivity to disaggregating agents, and GPIb clustering. \\n\\r\\nThis thesis describes how metabolic suppression improves the preservation of platelet function during prolonged storage. The mechanism of arrest of energy generation prior to cold storage is described (Chapter 2); and how transient metabolic blockade prior to cold storage might be involved in the delay of apoptotic activities and their correlations to platelet binding and phagocytosis (Chapter 3). Furthermore, the different steps in the mechanism of stimulus response coupling are discussed in relation to the role of P-selectin expression, changes in GPIbα expression and PS exposure (Chapter 4). After introduction of metabolic suppression in absence of metabolic inhibitors we adjusted metabolic suppression to conditions compatible with blood bank procedures (Chapter 5). Finally the pilot studies in the blood banks revealed that our developed metabolic suppression prior to cold better preserves platelet functions compared to controls after 18 days storage.\"],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Cardiac and pulmonary complications are common in subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), but also other extracerebral complications are frequently observed. This thesis focuses on the occurrence of extracerebral organ dysfunction and the additional value of markers of these medical complications in prognosticating the occurrence of delayed cerebral ischemia or poor outcome.\\n\\r\\nThe electrocardiogram and serum cardiac troponin I level are simple tools to screen patients for cardiac dysfunction. ECG abnormalities did not predict the occurrence of delayed cerebral ischemia and have limited value in prognosticating poor outcome. Cardiac Troponin I is a powerful predictor for the occurrence of pulmonary and cardiac complications in patients with aneurysmal SAH. \\n\\r\\nPulmonary edema  and depressed cardiac contractile function were frequently observed in the first 5 days after SAH. A depressed cardiac output was also frequently seen but usually mild and self limiting within one day. A depressed cardiac contractile function in at least one day in the first 5 days after SAH onset was more prevalent in patients with an elevated cardiac troponin I. Single transpulmonary thermodilution technique (providing estimates of pulmonary edema and cardiac function) is a promising tool for monitoring SAH patients especially with elevated cardiac troponin I on admission.\\n\\r\\nAn important and frequently used severity of illness score in the intensive care unit (the SAPS II score) is a useful and reliable prognosticator in SAH patients. This score may in some circumstances provide more information than specific SAH rating scales in predicting poor outcome or the occurrence of delayed cerebral ischemia. Of the individual parameters of the SAPS II score, PaO2/ FiO2 ratio, serum urea, age and the GCS were independent prognosticators of poor outcome.\\n\\r\\nOf the 83 patients who completed quality of life (QoL) questionnaires 9 patients (11%) had a poor outcome on the modified Rankin scale. Forty three (53%) of patients complained of tiredness and 42 (51%) had negative job consequences. In these patients disorders of sleep and wake occurred in one-third. Patients with severe sleep disturbances often have a considerably reduced QoL.\\n\\r\\nTo epitomize: extracerebral organ dysfunction is frequently seen after SAH. Grading scales incorporating signs of extracerebral organ dysfunction should be used more frequently by neurologists and neurosurgeons treating SAH patients. Cardiac troponin I can be used as marker to identify patients who are at risk of developing cardiopulmonary complications and could benefit from early invasive hemodynamic monitoring. Additional studies using single transpulmonary thermodilution are required to study the effects of cardiac and pulmonary estimates on delayed cerebral ischemia and outcome in SAH patients. Also studies with extended follow-up are required to evaluate whether a therapeutic strategy taking into account cardiac index, cardiac contractile function and extravascular lung water can improve supportive therapy and outcome. The improvement of long-term outcome should focus on attention for sleep disorders in patients complaining of daytime fatigue, restless or, nonrestorative sleep, snoring and restless legs syndrome.'],\n",

       "  'Description': [\"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common life-threatening autosomal recessive inherited disease in Caucasians, and is characterized by progressive lung disease, pancreatic insufficiency, malnutrition, hepatobiliary disease and elevated sweat electrolyte levels. The increased survival of CF patients during the past 20 years is the result of optimal nutrition, aggressive use of antibiotics, meticulous physiotherapy and exercise programs, and a better understanding of the disease. This thesis aimed to investigate the effect of exercise and nutrients on the physical condition of pediatric patients with cystic fibrosis. Chapter 1: Effects of anaerobic training in children with cystic fibrosis. Aerobic exercise programs have shown inconsistent effects on pulmonary function and suboptimal compliance. We found that high-intensity anaerobic training, mimicking children's natural activity pattern and containing the necessary variation, could enhance anaerobic and aerobic performance, and improve health-related quality of life in children with mild-to-moderate CF. Chapter 2: Short-term protein intake and stimulation of protein synthesis in stunted children with cystic fibrosis. Nutritional strategies in CF focus primarily on high-energy and high-fat intake, but not on optimal protein intake. The current recommendations of 1.0-1.5 g protein/kg/d, might be suboptimal, since a portion of the CF patients are stunted, and chronic inflammation and recurrent infections induce protein catabolism. Comparing 3 isoenergetic diets with different amounts of protein (1.5, 3 and 5 g protein/kg/d), we found a significantly higher whole-body protein synthesis in the group receiving the highest amount of protein. Chapter 3: Micronutrients Chronic pulmonary inflammation and infection combined with maldigestion and malabsorption cause oxidative stress. Chapter 3.1: Decreased Coenzyme Q10 concentration in plasma of children with cystic fibrosis. We found significantly diminished plasma concentrations of the lipid soluble antioxidant CoQ10, but a normal ratio between oxidized and reduced CoQ10, in CF patients with mild-to-moderate pulmonary disease. .Chapter 3.2: Dietary supplementation with multiple micronutrients mixture: no beneficial effects in pediatric cystic fibrosis. Since CF is characterized by both oxidative stress and poor exercise tolerance we investigated the effect of a mixture of multiple micronutrients (ML1) with either antioxidant and/or muscle fortifying action. We found no beneficial effects on either pulmonary function or anaerobic and aerobic muscle performance in pediatric cystic fibrosis patients compared to placebo. Chapter 4.1: Abnormal mechanical and energetic properties of skeletal muscle in a mouse model of cystic fibrosis. CF patients often demonstrate altered skeletal muscle performance and exercise intolerance. We found evidence of intrinsic abnormality in fast-twitch extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and slow-twitch soleus (SOL) muscles in a transgenic mouse, with a C57BL/6 background and the δF508 mutation, as compared to wildtype. A significantly lower absolute, but significantly higher specific isometric force (force per gram muscle) of twitch contraction was seen. Chapter 4.2: Influence of micronutrients on the contractile properties of skeletal muscle in a mouse model of cystic fibrosis. We could positively influence the 'altered' mechanical muscle performance in superfused, intact, fast-twitch EDL muscle of both wild-type FVB and transgenic FVB/ δF508 mice by direct administration of CoQ10, but not of vitamins B2 or E, nor a mixture of α-lipoic acid and acetylcarnitine.\"],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The first part of this thesis deals with brain infarct patterns in patients with differing degrees of stenosis of the internal carotid artery. Stenosis or narrowing of the internal carotid artery (ICA) is a well-known cause of infarcts or strokes. Infarct maps are used to study differences in infarct pattern in patients with ICA stenosis. Infarct distribution maps for each stenosis category were created by mapping each CT image to an average brain image and applying this transformation to the manually segmented infarcts. The construction of the average CT brain image proceeded in two steps. First, a temporary average image was made, based on a small number of images. The temporary average image was used as reference image for the construction of the real average image. The use of a temporary average provides a better starting point than the use of a randomly selected image. Three different average images based on the same data were created. This was important for the evaluation of the registration consistency. The use of an average brain image as reference results in more consistent registration than the use of a single image. ICA stenosis was categorized into mild (0-49% stenosis), severe (50-99% stenosis), or occlusion (100% stenosis). In total, 80 patients with mild stenosis, 33 with severe stenosis, and 29 with occlusion of the ICA were included. Differences between the infarct maps were analyzed using a non-parametric randomization based technique. Subtle differences were found between mild stenosis and occlusion maps and between severe stenosis and occlusion maps, but not between mild and severe stenosis maps. Differences were located in the territory of the middle cerebral artery. Patients with ICA occlusion had larger infarct volumes than patients with mild or severe stenosis. Volumes between mild and severe stenosis did not differ.\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nThe second part of this thesis is focused on the impact of diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2) on brain volume and on white matter lesion volume and pattern. Magnetic resonance images (Inversion Recovery (IR) and Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR)) of 99 patients with DM2 and 46 controls were used. The images were segmented into white matter, gray matter, cerebrospinal fluid, lateral ventricles and white matter lesion (WML) using an automated k-Nearest Neighbour classification algorithm. Linear regression analyses adjusting for intracranial volume, age, gender and level of education revealed a significant decrease in gray matter volume in DM2 patients and significant increases in the volume of the lateral ventricles and of the WMLs. These differences were more pronounced in women.\\n\\r\\nAnalyses of differences in WML location in a random subset of subjects (61 DM2 patients and 26 controls) were directed at the white matter area around the lateral ventricles. The analyses were performed by non-rigid mapping of segmentations of cerebrospinal fluid, including the lateral ventricles, to a reference lateral ventricles image. Evaluation of this method showed an accurate matching of the lateral ventricles to the reference image. This deformation is used for WML mapping. WML patterns are made by summation of the mapped WMLs of DM2 patients and controls separately. Analysis of differences in WML pattern showed more frequent lining and capping of the lateral ventricles in DM2 patients. A separate analysis of men and women showed significant differences only in women.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Iron modulates phagocyte-endothelial cell interactions: Implications for atherosclerosis'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Atherosclerotic heart disease has claimed the lives of millions of people each year in the Western world, and rapidly increases in prevalence in many other places. The disease results from cholesterolemia, coupled with a chronic inflammatory condition of the vascular wall that lead to vessel occlusion and various clinical manifestations.In 1981, Sullivan suggested possible benefits of iron depletion against coronary artery disease, from the observations where men and menopausal women were more prone to develop this disease. Following Sullivan’s proposal, basic and clinical data have begun to provide explanations for a link between iron and atherosclerosis (Chapter 1). This thesis has aimed to investigate the role of iron in the inflammatory events crucial in atherogenesis, especially in the course of phagocyte-endothelial cell interactions.In vitro studies described in this thesis reveals an immunomodulatory function of iron in inflammation. Chapter 2 and Chapter 3 show that NTBI promotes accumulation of intracellular labile iron and production of oxygen-derived free radicals, leading to cell activation. Activation of endothelial cells is a well-characterized phenotype that leads to endothelial dysfunction in vivo, which not only will initiate the development of atherosclerosis, but also plays a role at a critical late step of thrombosis, promoting vessel occlusion and acute cardiovascular events. In combination with chronic infections iron enhances infection-induced endothelial activation (Chapter 4), implying that in the presence of other stressors, iron may contribute significantly in aggravating atherogenesis. In addition, in Chapter 6, the drawbacks of EDTA chelation therapy particularly in inducing endothelial activation are described. The use of this alternative therapy for atherosclerosis therefore needs to be critically reconsidered, especially in regards to its effectiveness and safety. Furthermore, iron also promotes monocyte (Chapter 2 and Chapter 5) and neutrophil (Chapter 7) activation. An increased number of phagocyte infiltrates may thus complicate the progression of atherosclerotic vascular diseases. The infiltration of monocytes also play a role in neuroinflammation, stimulating the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Finally, Chapter 8 demonstrates the involvement of iron in enhancing the rate and the production of oxidised LDL cholesterol, especially through interactions with phagocyte-derived oxygen metabolites. Based on the findings in this thesis, iron depletion and iron chelation could be beneficial for such unfavourable conditions generated by iron. The identified modifying role of iron in inflammation described in this study (Chapter 9) offers an additional strategy for prevention and therapy of inflammatory diseases, like atherosclerotic vascular diseases and neurodegenerative diseases.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The aim of the research described in this Thesis is to design polymeric micelles showing controlled instability due to \"hydrophobic to hydrophilic\" conversion of the core, and to demonstrate its utility as a drug delivery vehicle. For that purpose, a novel class of thermosensitive and biodegradable polymers, poly(N-(2-hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide mono/di lactate) (poly(HPMAm-mono/di lactate)), were synthesized. The cloud point (CP) of these polymers in water varied depending on the ratio of the copolymer composition. Since poly(HPMAm-dilactate), having a CP of 13 °C, is converted in time to poly(HPMAm-monolactate) (CP of 65 °C) or more hydrophilic pHPMAm, this polymer was supposed to be suitable for \"hydrophobic to hydrophilic\" conversion at body temperature. Therefore, amphiphilic AB block copolymers of poly(HPMAm-dilactate) and poly(ethylene glycol) (pHPMAmDL-b-PEG) were synthesized. These block copolymers formed polymeric micelles in water with a size of around 50 nm by rapidly heating an aqueous polymer solution from below to above the critical micelle temperature (CMT). By cryo-transmission electron microscopy analysis, it was shown that pHPMAmDL-b-PEG micelles have a spherical shape with a narrow size distribution. 1H NMR and static light scattering measurements demonstrated that the micelles have solid-like and dense core structures and that the hydrophobic core is stabilized with a hydrophilic PEG corona. Most importantly, the pHPMAmDL-b-PEG micelles showed controlled dissolution at body temperature as a result of the hydrophilization of the core due to the hydrolysis of the lactic acid side chain in the thermosensitive block, demonstrating that our concept of controlled instability can be achieved with pHPMAmDL-b-PEG micelles. Next, the loading of paclitaxel (PTX), a very hydrophobic cytostatic drug, into pHPMAmDL-b-PEG micelles was studied. Taking advantage of the thermosensitivity of pHPMAmDL-b-PEG, the loading was done by simple mixing of a small volume of a concentrated PTX solution in ethanol and an aqueous polymer solution and subsequent heating of the resulting solution above the CMT of the polymer. PTX could be almost quantitatively loaded in the micelles up to 2 mg/mL. Release of PTX was induced by the pH-dependent destabilization of the micelles at relatively high concentration of PTX, while dialysis against a large volume of water induced the release of PTX by diffusion. PTX-loaded micelles showed comparable cytotoxicity as Taxol (clinically used formulation of PTX in a 50:50 mixture of Cremophor EL and ethanol) against B16F10 cells. On the other hand, the empty micelles were far less toxic than the Cremophor EL vehicle, which is beneficial for in vivo applications. When administered intravenously into rats, pHPMAmDL-b-PEG micelles showed a relatively long blood circulation time with 20 % of the injected dose still circulating in the bloodstream after 24 hours. In contrast to empty micelles, PTX that was loaded into pHPMAmDL-b-PEG micelles was cleared quite rapidly after intravenous administration in mice. PTX-loaded pHPMAmDL-b-PEG micelles showed comparable in vivo antitumor efficacy as Taxol both after intravenous and intraperitoneal administration. In conclusion, the work presented in this Thesis indicates that pHPMAmDL-b-PEG polymeric micelles have promising features as vehicles for hydrophobic drugs owing to their controlled instability.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Recovery of gait after stroke'],\n",
       "  'Description': [\"In the Netherlands annually about 30,000 people suffer a stroke for the first time. One third of these stroke patients die within the first year, while 41% experience long term disabilities. This makes stroke a major disease in medical and in socio-economic terms. Not just on society but also, and far most, on the afflicted individual and his or her environment the impact is felt of a sustained stroke. Following a stroke a person's independence in moving about may be significantly compromised. The expected level of walking to a great extent determines the expected level of activities of daily living and possible discharge to home. \\n\\r\\nThis thesis describes the long term recovery of hemiplegic gait in severely affected stroke patients. Based on the application of a repeated measurement research design, data were obtained within the first post-stroke year period. This information subsequently enabled the identification of time-related changes and was used to address the following main questions: \\n\\r\\nAre intensive stroke rehabilitation programmes, implemented within the early and subacute post-stroke phases, worthwhile in terms of long term functional gains and can this long term recovery be estimated early after stroke onset for better individualized reliable therapeutic goal setting and discharge planning? \\n\\r\\nFor this purpose, early and late recovery patterns were studied as functional recovery after stroke tends to be non-linear and time-dependent. Subsequently, this information was used in the interpretation of some of the mechanisms involved in the long term recovery of hemiplegic gait and the impact of intensity of therapeutic interventions on this recovery. \\n\\r\\nThe main findings of the studies presented in the first part of this thesis indicate predictive relationships between early determinants and late outcome and the relevance of measuring frequently and longitudinally in order to take into consideration the non-linear time-dependent relationship of covariates with recovery of gait after stroke. In the second part it is demonstrated that the long term effects of intensity of stroke rehabilitation, implemented during the initial 20 post-stroke weeks, are maintained for up to one year. However, a significant number of patients with incomplete recovery showed improvements or deterioration of walking ability and ADL beyond the error threshold between 6 and 12 months post-stroke.\\n\\r\\nSeveral mechanisms involved in stroke recovery are discussed, such as recovery of penumbral tissues, neural plasticity, resolution of diaschisis and behavioural compensation strategies. Rehabilitation is believed to modulate this logistic pattern of recovery, most likely by interacting with these underlying processes. Our prediction models suggest that outcome is largely defined within the first weeks post-stroke.\"],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Coeliac disease (CD) is a chronic intolerance to a dietary protein called gluten. This protein is present in common cereals such as wheat, barley and rye, and it is needed to prepare the derivate products such as bread or pasta. CD only occurs in individuals that carry certain altered genes. The identification of these genes and how they contribute to developing the disease is therefore crucial to understanding this disorder. When we started this study in 2001, we knew that gluten activated an abnormal immune response leading to specific intestinal damage. The work performed in this project aimed to identify which genes drive the development of the disease by comparing the expression of the genes in the intestine of coeliac patients to non-coeliacs. This work unraveled new insights into the adaptive and innate immune responses to gluten, and led us to propose that the damage in the intestine occurs because the intestinal cells are not able to reach their complete functionality and their location. The knowledge gained will guide the search for other genes that cause CD. It will also help the development of diagnostic tools for identifying patients at risk of developing CD and of new avenues for therapeutic intervention.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Adaptation of signal transduction and muscle proteome in trained horses'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['In the present thesis the localization and activation of signaling proteins, known from human studies, in equine muscle were investigated under conditions of rest, after an acute bout of exercise and before and after a period of (intensified) training. Proteins of interest (protein kinase C (PKC), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and heat shock protein 27 (HSP27)) were studied using histological and biochemical techniques. PKC isoforms were differentially expressed in muscle fiber types and the subcellular localization at rest was different among PKC isoforms. MAPKs and HSP27 were differentially activated upon an acute bout of exercise in muscle of horses, whereas a normal or intensified training program did not result in clear long-term adaptations of these signaling proteins. In order to investigate training-induced fiber transitions, MHC content was determined as well. Changes were found in MHC content between muscles. However, training did not induce a change in MHC content which suggests no conversion of muscle fiber types upon training. In addition, for the first time in horses, proteomic technology was used in rhabdomyolysis and used to elucidate (intensified) training-induced muscle adaptation at the protein level. In cases of acute tying-up, horses expressed an altered form of creatine kinase M chain. Furthermore, the expression level of various proteins changed upon normal or intensified training. From the overall findings of this thesis we hypothesize that, like in human muscle, PKC isoforms, p38 MAPK, JNK and HSP27 play a major role in equine muscle cell signaling. Since these proteins are involved in the insulin signaling cascade, the findings emphasize the importance of the equine muscle in glucose homeostasis as well. The similarities between human and equine muscle cell signaling make the horse an excellent model to study biological markers for guiding training and preventing overtraining in humans and horses. Moreover, the application of such markers could increase the welfare of the equine athlete in clinical practice. The unraveling of the equine genome would facilitate the identification of new markers using proteomic technology. Despite the similarities between the human and equine athlete and the way they adapt to training, it remains to be elucidated whether or not other aspects (mental, neuro-endocrine, metabolic) act analogous in the process of developing overtraining.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Cystoid macular edema in uveitis : More than meets the eye'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Cystoid macular edema (CME) is a major complication of uveitis, which has an especially severe course in elderly patients. CME was noted in 33% of all uveitis patients, of whom 44% had low vision (visual acuity equal to or less than 20/60) in at least one eye. Of all uveitis patients with low vision, 42% was caused by CME. The aim of this thesis was to elucidate the possible role of vascular disease in the development of inflammatory CME and to explore the new treatment options for inflammatory CME. The new key insight into the pathogenesis of CME consists of an association between inflammatory CME and generalized microvascular damage. Until now, CME has been considered to represent a complication of uveitis associated with leaking ocular vessels and was believed to represent an ocular disorder only. However, our findings linked microalbuminuria, which is typical for a general vascular disorder, to inflammatory CME. If the pathological vascular conditions constitute a high risk for developing CME, we would expect that the vessel protecting drugs might have a beneficial effect on inflammatory CME. We found no effects of short-term lisinopril medication on inflammatory CME. However, other promising vascular protecting drugs are available and could be investigated in the future. Various cytokines and factors influencing the endothelial function play a role in the increased vascular permeability of patients with CME. Recent advances in the technique of the multiplex immunoassay allow us to measure a variety of cytokines in small volumes as in intraocular fluid samples. The understanding of the function that these mediators have in various uveitis entities and their effect on the vascular permeability and the vascular endothelium could lead to a better insight in the pathogenesis of these disorders. It could also lead to the development of novel therapeutic interventions for diverse uveitis entities and possibly also CME. Standard treatments for CME are frequently reported to be inefficient and associated with (systemic) side effects. We investigated the effect of systemic NSAIDs on visual acuity and inflammatory CME, but found a limited (if any) effect. Only a high drop out rate because of side effects (26%) of this medication was reported. In contrast, the use of intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide (IVTA) injections has given ophthalmologists a powerful tool in the treatment of CME with no -or very limited- systemic side effects. The role of IVTA might especially be of value in those patients with acute presentations and/or severe recurrences of non-infectious intraocular inflammation and patients with intractable inflammatory CME. IVTA might shorten the time interval needed to achieve improvement or remission in patients otherwise treated with slow acting medications. Further studies with longer follow-up and a higher number of patients of various uveitis entities are needed to determine the exact place of IVTA in the treatment of uveitis and inflammatory CME.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['From the studies described in this thesis, investigating different aspects of outcome assessment in total hip arthroplasty, the following conclusions and recommendations can be made: \\r\\nTo ensure good quality of life and adequate mobility for future elderly generations, adequate measures need to be taken to respond adequately to the increasing demand for THA, for instance with regard to future budgets for THA, the use of cost-effective prosthesis systems and training of surgeons and other medical personnel. \\n\\r\\nThe revision burden of THA (Total Hip Arthroplasty) in the Netherlands is relatively high compared to the Scandinavian countries. Apart from figures from a discharge registry and an implant registry with compliance less than 60% and no possibilities for follow-up, there is no registration system for THA in the Netherlands. In spite of problems with liability, compliance, cost and confidentiality with the introduction of a register, new efforts should be undertaken within the Dutch orthopaedic community to start nation-wide orthopaedic registries. Such registries should serve both as a database to study outcome after surgery and as a benchmarking tool for all participating clinics. \\n\\r\\nThe moderate to good compliance to existing recommendations for the indication for THA found in our survey of Dutch and Swedish orthopaedic surgeons shows the applicability of these recommendations in clinical practice. However, we found that patients in a later phase of the disease process did not improve to the level achieved by patients with a better preoperative function. Therefore, traditional orthopaedic practice, to delay surgery as long as possible, might need to be re-evaluated, especially for elderly patients. Clinical guidelines on THA, based on review of clinical evidence and involving cost-effectiveness and patient preference, should be established in both The Netherlands and Sweden. Apart from consensus statements, no such guidelines exist in either country.\\n\\r\\nBecause of the multiple risk factors found for re-revision for both septic and aseptic loosening, and the relatively low annual number of revisions for infection, the findings of our study on revisions for infection from the Swedish National Hip Registry might be a reason to centralize these difficult treatment procedures in specialized clinics. This would also improve adequate monitoring of the type and resistance patterns of bacteria found in these infections. Development of resistant bacteria is a worrisome trend in medicine in general and especially in the vulnerable group of patients with an artificial joint. Future research in prevention and treatment of this devastating complication is needed to maintain the high percentages of patients with excellent outcome after THA. \\n\\r\\nLong waits for THA cause considerable loss in quality-adjusted life years for patients involved and thus impose an avertable burden of disability. With regard to the waiting list problem that still exists in orthopaedic surgery in The Netherlands and Sweden, especially for joint replacements, new approaches for managing waiting lists should be followed. These include reducing demand for the procedure by audits of waiting lists and reassessment of patients on the lists. Further, prioritization of patients on the waiting list based on clinical urgency is a strategy used in other countries. Lastly, reorganization of care patterns such as redirection of referrals to clinicians with shorter waiting lists, reduction of missed appointments and reduction of specialist physician follow-up visits are possibilities to improve access to a medical procedure like THA.\\r\\nIn this thesis, several aspects of outcome assessment in total hip arthroplasty were investigated. We should strive for continuous quality improvement of the procedure, by following and adapting practice guidelines based on patient oriented outcome measures and population studies, to use available health care resources in an optimal way and to guarantee best quality care to our patients.'],\n",

We give an overview of the existing literature of both experimental (in vitro and in vivo) and clinical studies that address this issue.\\n\\r\\nImaging of tumor growth, tumor characteristics and the effect of therapeutic interventions in living animals (intravital imaging) has been made possible by new molecular and optical techniques. In chapter 3 we validate bioluminescence imaging as a minimally invasive tool to monitor tumor growth in the liver.\\n\\r\\nKRAS is important as an initiator of CRC tumorigenesis. In chapters 4 and 5 we asses the dependency of late stage CRC cells on mutant KRAS. We analyze this with a highly aggressive CRC cell line that harbors an endogenous KRAS mutation. In chapter 4 we assess the effect of endogenous mutant KRAS on the interplay between CRC cells and the immune system. In chapter 5 we analyze which distinct stages in the process of liver colonization are affected by endogenous mutant KRAS.\\n\\r\\nRAS proteins signal through a number of distinct signaling cascades. COX-2 is important in the development of multiple cancers, including CRC and bladder carcinoma. The exact relationship between endogenous mutant RAS and COX-2 is unclear. In chapter 6 we investigate this relationship in CRC cells. Furthermore, we investigate the potential therapeutic effects of selective COX-2 inhibitors in a mouse model of established CRC liver metastasis in chapter 6 and in a mouse model of bladder carcinomas in chapter 7.\\r\\nIn the ensuing chapters we focus on reovirus, one of the most promising RAS-directed therapeutics. We investigate the mechanism underlying the RAS-specificity of tumor cell killing in chapters 8 and 9. Next, in chapter 10 we assess the potential of reovirus as a therapeutic agent against experimental CRC liver metastases and investigate the role of the immune system on the therapeutic effect. In chapter 11 we investigate the susceptibility of freshly resected human liver metastases to reovirus T3D infection.\\n\\r\\nWe conclude that late stage CRC cells are dependent on mutant KRAS for their invasiveness, metastatic potential and for immune evasion. This makes mutant KRAS an interesting therapeutic target with great potential against metastatic colorectal carcinomas. COX-2 is a direct target of mutant KRAS and selective COX-2 inhibitors have therapeutic potential against colorectal liver metastases and bladder carcinomas.\\n\\r\\nMutant KRAS sensitizes CRC cells to reovirus T3D induced apoptosis. The therapeutic efficacy of  reovirus T3D against established liver metastases is hampered by the host immune system but can be increased by concomitant immunosuppression. The mislocalization of the reovirus receptor JAM-1 in human colorectal liver metastases may be an obstacle for its use as a oncolytic agent in the clinic.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Lower respiratory tract infections are an important cause for morbidity and mortality and associated with considerable costs and antibiotic consumption, especially in patients needing hospitalization. The aim of this thesis was to evaluate diagnostic and treatment strategies to decrease costs and control antibiotic use in hospitalized patients.\\n\\r\\nEarly identification of patients with high risk a for a complicated course could prevent unnecessary ICU admissions, complications or deaths. However, current definitions of severe CAP do not seem suitable to guide pneumonia management. A new prediction rule based on routine clinical, biochemical and microbiological information was proposed to determine which patients are at risk for early clinical failure. \\n\\r\\nResults of rapid microbiological tests can help in tailoring therapy early in the course of treatment. An algorithm was developed to determine cost savings based on the results of rapid diagnostic testing. Application of this algorithm to a population of patients hospitalised with CAP showed that the use of Gram staining of sputum or urinary antigen testing to diagnose pneumococcal pneumonia will lead to only minimal cost-savings. \\n\\r\\nCessation of empirically initiated antibiotic treatment may be justified if viruses are identified. Clinical and economical impact of early, rapid and sensitive identification of viral infection by means of novel Taq-man real-time PCR techniques was evaluated in a randomized trial. Diagnostic yield increased as compared to routine diagnostic procedures and viral infections were detected in over 20%, but its use was not associated with reductions in antibiotic use or costs. Hence, real-time PCR should not become part of the routine work-up for every patient, unless the cost-effectiveness can be improved. However, financial investment in rapid tests may outweigh the costs associated with future treatment of infections caused by resistant micro-organisms.\\n\\r\\nPutative beneficial effects of initial combination treatment with a b-lactam antibiotics plus a macrolides or monotherapy with fluoroquinolones are an increased patient survival as compared to with a b-lactam monotherapy; possible disadvantages are increases in antibiotic use and treatment costs. In a systematic review, unequivocal evidence of increased patient survival only mounted form studies with substantial patient prescription bias. Contrary, antibiotic use and treatment costs would increase with about 20%, increasing up to over 50% in patients with moderate CAP, whereas the adequacy of therapy hardly changes. Therefore, the current evidence for the use of combination therapy or treatment with fluoroquinolones in CAP is not strong enough to justify a place in routine clinical practice. \\n\\r\\nIn theory, an early switch from intravenous to oral therapy reduces intravenous drug costs and allows an early discharge from hospital, but risks increase in treatment failures and treatment costs outside the hospital. In a study evaluating these factors, a early conversion to oral treatment significantly reduced length of hospital stay and overall costs as compared to a 7-day course of intravenous treatment. There were comparable clinical outcomes. Future steps towards more efficient management may include even shorter courses of antimicrobial treatment and implementation of early switch strategies in clinical practice.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Liver diseases occur quite frequently in dogs; the overall incidence in dogs has been estimated around 1-2% of the clinical cases. Most liver diseases are, like in humans, chronic and occur through chronic inflammation due to different causes. In all cases the on-going liver cell damage leads to a reduction of the functional liver cell mass and progressive deposition of fibrous tissue in the liver. These two phenomena, atrophy and fibrosis, are two sides of one medal and go hand in hand to cause fatal liver dysfunction in the end stage. The large regenerative capacity of the liver is lost in the course of chronic disease. There is convincing evidence that the two main counteracting factors, Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF) and Transforming Growth Factor-β1 (TGF-β1), determine the outcome of liver disease. HGF is the principal factor stimulating the liver to grow and regenerate and suppresses fibrosis and apoptosis. In contrast, TGF-β1 induces formation of excessive fibrous tissue and a reduction of the regenerative capacity together with stimulation of cell death. The findings with respect to the crucial counteracting effects of HGF and TGF-β1 in liver growth, regeneration and fibrosis, have stimulated researchers to investigate the potential of administering HGF to experimental animals given hepatotoxic or fibrogenic drugs. Administration of HGF completely prevented or, when given afterwards, reversed toxic effects. Even in cases of chronic damage with already formed disruption of the normal micro-architecture of the liver, fibrosis and atrophy (cirrhosis), this phenomenon could largely be reversed. Furthermore, the normal fatal course of peracute fulminant hepatitis (severe acute hepatic sepsis or toxicity) could be prevented in experimental animals. The few studies in dogs indicate that the above findings also apply to this species. Interestingly, one of the first reports of a very potent liver regeneration stimulating factor (now known as HGF) was found in dogs. Extrapolation for the above mentioned rodent models to human medicine has not been achieved. The use of novel therapeutic approaches in dogs presented at the veterinary clinic could be seen as a much more relevant animal model for the translation to human clinical medicine. For instance, HGF treatment during normally life-threatening hepatic diseases could cause a revolution in the treatment of liver diseases (in both man and dog). Therapeutic intervention could be achieved by the addition of the HGF-glycoprotein itself. Alternatively, and in line with the concept that the clinical outcome is determined by the balance between HGF and TGF-β1, gene therapy approaches resulting in blocking the effects of TGF-β1 have been similarly effective, at least in chronic disease models. Taken together, the central theme of this thesis involves several aims. The first aim is to describe the regulatory roles of Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF) and Transforming Growth Factor-β1 (TGF-β1), via the respective receptors c-MET and TGF-β1 receptors type II and I in growth, regeneration, and formation of fibrosis in a variety of liver diseases. Second, development of therapeutic tools based on the above insights to treat liver diseases characterized by inadequate growth or atrophy with fibrosis and/or cirrhosis, especially by influencing the balance between HGF and TGF-β1 in the liver. Finally, initial evaluation of the effects of such therapeutic tools.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['To gain insight into the surface chemistry of live microorganisms, pH stat experiments are combined with analyses of the time-dependent changes in solution chemistry using suspensions of live cells of Shewanella putrefaciens. The results of this study illustrate the complex response of the live cells to changes in pH of the aqueous medium. In particular, the observed acid-base activity of the organism cannot be attributed solely to the protonation or deprotonation reactions of functional groups in the cell wall. Time-dependent acid and base consumption curves by the bacterial cells are interpreted to consist of the following three contributions. (1) The near-instantaneous (time scale of minutes) buffering capacity associated with the functional groups present in the cell wall, (2) the short-term (< 1 hour) utilization of the intracellular buffering capacity, and (3), under basic conditions, the long-term (1-5 hours) release of (acidic) metabolic byproducts. By measuring the initial acid or base consumption at different pH values, the buffering capacity associated with the functional groups in the cell wall can be determined as a function of the pH of the medium. Lipopolysaccharides (LPS), the major constituent of the outermost layer of the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria, contribute little to the buffering capacity of the intact cell wall. Comparing the buffering capacities of the cell walls of live cells to that of cell wall components show that, while LPS may be important in regulating cell adhesion of Gram-negative bacteria, they may not provide many anionic binding sites for metal cations. The latter must therefore migrate deeper inside the cell wall. The main sources of acidity that explain the long-term base neutralizing capacity of live cells of S. putrefaciens are release of organic acids and dissolution of metabolically produced CO2. The redox, pH and temperature conditions regulate the type and rates of excreted metabolic products since each microorganism functions at an optimum pH and temperature. The observed release of acids under basic conditions may have important implications for the activity of live microorganisms in natural environments. For instance, by releasing protons, metal reducing bacteria, such as S. putrefaciens, may compensate for the proton consumption due to metal reduction, thereby maintaining favorable conditions for metal reduction in their immediate vicinity. Combining the results of the initial part of the acid-base consumption curves in the pH stat experiments with Zn2+ and Cu2+ binding experiments provides information about the surface chemistry of the cell walls. Carboxylate and phosphate groups are identified as the major sites for metal binding to S. putrefaciens. The binding isotherms of Cu2+ are best explained by invoking the presence of a small percentage of high affinity carboxylate sites in the cell wall. Using a simple cell wall complexation model shows that metal binding to cell wall functional groups is sensitive to the competition with metal complexation reactions of organic acids in solution, as well as to the acid-base properties of the high affinity sites in the cell wall. Characterization of the affinity of the organic ligands, released by cellular activity, for metal ions is needed to better constrain the affinity constants of cell wall functional groups for metal ions.'],\n",

       "  'Description': [\"The human body contains an important mechanism to protect itself against pathogens like bacteria or viruses: the immune system. T cells are central cells of the immune system and are essential in the defence against these foreign invaders. When no bacteria or viruses are around, T cell circulate in a resting state in the blood scanning the surroundings. When T cells sense the presence of unwanted guests they come into action: first they expand in numbers, by activation and cell division and then they change into cells specialised to fight the invader. The end result is a large number of T cells, armed to combat the pathogens. In the defence against foreign substances T cell signal to other cells of the immune system, so-called B cells, that invaders are present. When signalled by the T cells, these B cells start to produce'antibodies'; small substances that circulate in the blood to search and aid killing of the pathogenic substances. Production of these antibody occurs for instance when people are vaccinated. We have studied two molecules that are expressed on the surface of T cells and are mandatory for the activation, division and changing into armed T cells: CD28 and ICOS. In this thesis we have dissected the respective role of the relatively recently discovered molecule ICOS compared to the well studied molecule CD28. CD28 is mandatory for initiation of the cascade changing resting T cells into armed pool of specialized T cells. We have found that next to CD28, ICOS is also mandatory for the division and survival of T cells, resulting in expansion of the T cell pool. We looked inside the T cell and found that both molecules generate similar signals that lead to these comparable functions. Moreover, we found that both CD28 and ICOS are crucial for the antibody production after vaccination against the bacteria N. meningitidis. The similarities between ICOS and CD28 suggest that both molecules are attractive targets for immunotherapy. Activation through these molecules could boost the immune system when desirable or blocking the function could prevent aberrant T cell activation in the case of auto-immunity. Moreover, the presence of either CD28 or ICOS could be a diagnostic tool predicting the responses to vaccination.\"],\n",

The universal character of this regulatory system predicts that it represents one basic link between very different physiological parameters, sphingolipid homeostasis and pH regulation. This discovery may have an impact on developing cures for diseases of sphingolipid metabolism, like Gaucher and Farber disease, where the cellular accumulations of glucosylceramide and ceramide may actually induce pathogenesis via an effect on pH.

       "  'Description': ['Field imperfections are normally undesirable in magnetic resonance imaging. They degrade the quality of the images by wrong depiction of the anatomy and decrease of the signal-to-noise ratio. Furthermore, for velocity, flow and diffusion quantification, measurement errors related to these imperfections are induced. Analysis of the imperfections can be used to correct for the associated artifacts and errors. Next to that, it can create new contrast mechanisms, speed up the acquisition procedure or provide functional and structural information. In this thesis, field imperfections were analyzed for three purposes, viz. to quantify and correct for biased flow values at off-center locations, to provide structural information of foreign materials by susceptibility analysis and to visualize interventional devices. With regard to the first purpose, it was demonstrated that for increasing off-center positions, flow values get more biased because of increasing inhomogeneity of the main field and nonlinearity of the gradient fields for spatial and velocity encoding. By field mapping with local scaling factors, the spatial dependency of the flow biases was analyzed. The same scaling factors were used for correction. The second purpose of susceptibility analysis was twofold and included the detection and quantification of crystal structure transformations in implant alloys and the characterization of foreign objects. The magnetic susceptibility of implant alloys and the accompanying susceptibility artifacts in MR images depend on the microcrystalline structure of the alloy. It was shown that microcrystalline transformation could be detected and quantified by analysis of the susceptibility artifacts, which facilitates to reconstruct the thermo-mechanical state of the material in order to detect early failure or to measure interaction between tissue and implant. In this thesis, the alloys stainless steel AISI 304L and Nitinol were used. The characterization of foreign objects was done with susceptibility analysis of metallic foreign particles. By use of simulation, it was shown that, on basis of clinically used spin echo and gradient echo MR images, no distinction could be made between the volume and the susceptibility of the particles. This gap could be filled up by X-ray, because with this modality the size of a particle could be measured. Computed tomography failed in this respect as the size of the particle was overestimated. With regard to the third purpose, the visualization of interventional devices by exploitation of locally induced artifacts (markers), simulations were performed in order to quantify the field strength dependency of the markers on a device. The material to create a marker has to be easily magnetizable in order to invoke a satisfactory artifact and, preferably, the magnetization has to be field strength independent. Among others, the ferromagnetic stainless steel AISI 410 was chosen as marker material as it was the most effective for marker construction. In vivo'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Low atrial septum pacing in pacemaker patients'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['In patients with an indication for anti bradycardia pacing, atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common arrhythmia (30-50%) even in the absence of atrial tachy arrhythmias before pacemaker implantation. Pace prevention and pace intervention for atrial tachy arrhythmias could be an interesting adjuvant treatment in the prevention of the arrhythmia related complications. These treatment modalities when available in pacemaker systems could come at a relative low cost as the indication for pacemaker implant already exists. This thesis is aimed to explore the possibilities of an alternative atrial site pacing modality in the prevention of AF in pacemaker patients. Though the \"perfect candidate\" for this kind if preventive pacing is not clearly evident, the method of pacing and its feasibility is explored. Chapter 2-3-4 The technique of low atrial septum pacing is more complicated as compared to RAA pacing. The technique of implantation with the aid of a locator tool, its pitfalls and the verification of a proper right low atrial septal lead positioning is described and the results are evaluated. The typical ECG is described, electrical measurements as pacing threshold, sensing, impedance and far field R-wave detection are compared to the more traditional right atrial appendage pacing. Chapter 5 When the result of a therapy is to be appreciated, the yardstick for measurement should be reliable. For this reason the duration of the automated mode switch (AMS) was compared with 7 days Holter derived atrial arrhythmia data. Cumulative duration of AF and atrial tachycardia (AT) from Holter was correctly interpreted by the pacemaker in 99.9 %. In patients with AT without AF on Holter the cumulative AT duration did not compare well (63%) with the Holter recordings. The number of mode switches does not reflect the number of episodes of AF/AT. Chapter 6 A good sensing characteristic of atrial arrhythmias (AA) is imperative for AA prevention and intervention pacemakers. A newly designed bipolar screw-in lead was evaluated. As a result of the positive outcome with the animal study, an acute human experiment was performed. In the acute human tests in 15 patients, the mean P-wave voltage was comparable with the commercially available lead. The far field signal reduction was importantly improved (p < 0.0001). Pacing thresholds and pacing impedances were comparable. Chapter 7 A prospective patient blinded study was performed to evaluate right atrial appendage (RAA) and low atrial septum (LAS) overdrive pacing to non overdrive pacing on the AF burden in 280 pacemaker patients. The algorithm was switched on or off in a 3 month, single blind crossover design and antiarrhythmic drugs were kept stable. A control group of 96 patients without PAF served to assess any proarrhythmic effect of overdrive pacing. AF burden was not reduced during automatic atrial overdrive neither from the RAA nor from the LAS. There was no proarrhythmia induced by the overdrive algorithm in the control group. At this moment in time, it is unlikely that pacemaker mediated therapy for AF will be effective in pacemaker patients as single strategy.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Neurobiology of stress adaptation in the mouse: Roles of corticotropin-releasing factor and urocortin 1'],\n",
       "  'Description': [\"The body's ability to adapt to stressors is essential for survival. Failure of stress adaptation may lead to the development of stress-related disorders. The traditionally known adaptation system in vertebrates, is the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA-) axis, in which corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) plays a central role. The discovery of the CRF-related peptide, urocortin 1 (Ucn1), acting through CRF receptors, raises the question how CRF-related peptides, collaborate in stress adaptation. This question underlies this thesis research. We focused on the dynamics of CRF, Ucn1 and their receptors CRF1 and CRF2. In Chapter 2 we show that the CRF overexpressing (CRF-OE) mouse has increased amounts of CRF peptide and mRNA in the CNS only. This over-expression is associated with increased levels of bioactive CRF in the hypothalamus, increased body temperature and heart rate, as compared to wild-type (WT) mice. In Chapter 3 by using this transgenic mouse it is shown that CRF controls differentially the two CRF receptors, as to degree of mRNA expression and expression site in the brain: CRF over-production leads to a reduced number of CRF1 mRNA expressing neurons and to an increased number of neurons expressing CRF2 mRNA in specific brain areas . In Chapter 4 we support our hypothesis that CRF receptors, beside mediating actions of CRF-related peptides within the brain, also mediate such actions at the level of the spinal cord. The presence of both CRF receptor mRNAs is demonstrated throughout the spinal cord. In Chapters 5, 6 and 7 support has been gathered for the presumed role of the EW in stress adaptation. In Chapter 5 it is shown that chronic CRF excess down-regulates the Edinger-Westphal (EW)-Ucn1 expression. Furhtermore, the EW-Ucn1 neurons, in the CRF-OE mice respond, like the HPA axis to an acute challenge by increased Fos and Ucn1 mRNA expression. These results indicate that the HPA-axis and the EW work in concert in response to acute challenges but have opposite actions during chronic stress. We further investigated the EW during chronic activation of the HPA-axis, and show in Chapter 6 that, in contrast to the HPA-axis, the EW does not habituate to a chronic homotypic ether challenge and shows a down-regulation of Ucn1 mRNA levels vs. acutely stressed animals. Finally in Chapter 7 studies are described indicating that chronic-stress-induced activation of the adrenals might lead to inhibition of the EW-Ucn1 system, most likely through a direct action of corticosterone on EW-Ucn1 neurons. Notion supported by demonstrating that glucocorticoid receptors coexist with Ucn1 in EW-neurons, and that chronic corticosterone treatment reduces the number of EW-Ucn1 mRNA and peptide containing neurons. In Chapter 8 the results obtained in the thesis are put into a broader perspective, leading to the conclusion that CRF-OE mouse model is a suitable tool for investigating the role of chronically elevated CRF in the control of stress adaptation. Furthermore we propose that Ucn1-EW is involved in stress adaptation, and propose a series of studies to further elucidate the roles of CRF and Ucn1 in stress adaptation.\"],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Inhibition of NF-κB transcriptional activity by the estrogen receptor - Insights into the molecular mechanism'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['The steroid hormone estrogen plays a key role in the regulation of a wide variety of physiological processes, having profound effects on tissues throughout the human body. This becomes evident in postmenopausal women where estrogen deficiency is associated with increased risks for developing various diseases, including osteoporosis. Currently, it is established that estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) is an effective therapy for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. The protective effect of estrogen on the skeleton is due to inhibitory effect on bone resorption, which is attributed to suppressing the production of bone-resorbing cytokines. Unfortunately, ERT is associated with adverse effects, including an increased risk for breast and uterine cancer. An important alternative to ERT for the prevention of osteoporosis is the use of selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), which are compounds with estrogen agonistic or antagonistic effects depending on the tissue type. The biological effects of estrogen are mediated by the estrogen receptor (ER) belonging to the superfamily of nuclear receptors, which is the largest known group of eukaryotic transcription factors. Gene regulation by ER can be accomplished through direct DNA binding via estrogen response elements (EREs) or by modulating the activity of other transcription factors. The research described in this thesis focuses on the mechanisms involved in ER-mediated inhibition of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) transcriptional activity. NF-kappaB is the major regulator of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses, such as genes encoding cytokines. Therefore it is believed that cross-talk between ER and NF-kappaB lies at the basis of the anti-inflammatory, and thus bone protective, property of estrogen. ER exists as two different subtypes, ERalpha and ERbeta, and in this thesis it is shown that ERalpha, and not ERbeta, is the major ER through which transcription of NF-kappaB-regulated genes is inhibited (Chapter 2). Several indirect mechanisms, that may explain the inhibitory effect of ER on NF-kappaB activity, were excluded (Chapter 2 & 3). However, direct interactions between ER and NF-kappaB are described providing evidence for a direct mechanism (Chapter 4). The capacity to modulate NF-kappaB activity was assessed, not only for the natural ER-ligand 17beta-estradiol, but also for several SERMs (Chapter 2, 3 & 5). Through the use of specific mutants of ER it is shown that activation of ERE-dependent transcription and repression of NF-kappaB activity are two separate properties of ER that can occur independently of each other (Chapter 3). By using microarray analysis we determined the repressive effect of ERalpha on genes activated by TNFalpha, which is a cytokine that triggers the NF-kappaB pathway. Comparison of the expression profiles resulting from stimulation with 17beta-estradiol or SERMs revealed distinct effects of these ligands on TNFalpha-upregulated gene expression (Chapter 5). These findings may contribute to the development of estrogen-like compounds with anti-inflammatory properties for the treatment of diseases, such as osteoporosis and inflammatory diseases, without the adverse effects observed with current estrogen therapy.'],\n",

We describe the effects of treatment with the Angiotensin \\r\\n      Converting Enzyme(ACE)-inhibitor enalapril (treatment aimed at the \\r\\n      vasculature) on measures of cerebral function in streptozotocin (STZ) \\r\\n      diabetic rats. We found that experimental diabetes is associated with \\r\\n      reduced cerebral perfusion, and treatment with enalapril can partially \\r\\n      improve cerebral blood flow, deficits in Morris maze learning and \\r\\n      hippocampal synaptic plasticity.

Finally, we found that \\r\\n      long term treatment with enalapril prevented deficits in nerve conduction \\r\\n      velocity, and partially prevented deficits in BAEP and VEP latencies, \\r\\n      comparable to the previous study. However, we observed an increased \\r\\n      mortality in the long-term enalapril treated animals, probably due to \\r\\n      hypotension in combination with the effects of the STZ-model We thus \\r\\n      showed that impaired cerebral perfusion probably plays an important role \\r\\n      in the development of diabetic encephalopathy in experimental diabetes, \\r\\n      and showed for the first time that treatment aimed at improvement of \\r\\n      perfusion of the brain can partially prevent deficits in cerebral \\r\\n      function. Clinical study: The aim was to examine associations between \\r\\n      vascular risk factors, cognitive functioning and structural changes in the \\r\\n      brain in patients with DM2. To do so, we initiated the Utrecht Diabetes \\r\\n      Encephalopathy Study (UDES), a large cross-sectional study involving 125 \\r\\n      patients with DM2 and 64 matched non-diabetic controls. We found that \\r\\n      patients with DM2 had more cortical and subcortical atrophy and more deep \\r\\n      white matter lesions (DWML) and infarcts on brain MRI than controls. The \\r\\n      overall performance of patients with DM2 on the neuropsychological \\r\\n      examination was worse, particularly affecting the domains attention and \\r\\n      executive functioning, information processing speed and memory. Within the \\r\\n      DM2 group cognitive function was inversely related with white matter \\r\\n      lesions (WML), atrophy and the presence of infarcts. Furthermore, we found \\r\\n      that patients with DM2 had more microvascular complications, more \\r\\n      macrovascular (atherosclerotic) disease and more hypertension than \\r\\n      controls. Within the DM2 group impaired cognitive functioning was \\r\\n      associated with higher HbA1c levels, brain infarcts on MRI and a history \\r\\n      of vascular events. DM2 patients with retinopathy or with infarcts on MRI \\r\\n      had more severe cortical atrophy, whereas insulin levels, mean arterial \\r\\n      pressure, and macrovascular disease were associated with WML. We did not \\r\\n      find a relation between peripheral neuropathy and cerebral deficits in \\r\\n      patients with DM2, in contrast to previous findings in DM1 patients. \\r\\n      Finally, we showed that cerebrovascular reserve capacity (CVR) in patients \\r\\n      with DM2 is similar to that in controls. CVR was not affected by diabetes \\r\\n      duration, metabolic control, the presence of hypertension, intima/media \\r\\n      thickness, or albuminuria. In conclusion, diabetic encephalopathy is a \\r\\n      multifactorial condition, for which a history of macrovascular \\r\\n      atherosclerotic disease seems to be the most important risk factor. \\r\\n      Hyperglycaemia, vascular risk factors like hypertension and microvascular \\r\\n      complications seem to be of lesser importance.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['This thesis aimed at exploring new techniques for the surgical treatment of benign disorders of the esophagus. Specifically, studies were performed on surgery for gastroesophageal reflux disease and large (type II-IV) hiatal hernia. The chapters presented in this thesis involve studies that have been conducted to conclude on long-term durability and cost-effectiveness of laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. Furthermore, the background and treatment of failed primary antireflux surgery for gastroesophageal reflux disease in a large cohort series was studied and, finally, new surgical options for the repair of large hiatal hernia were investigated with emphasis on the advantages of robot-assistance and the selective addition of an antireflux procedure. In short, this thesis provides new insights into the long-term outcome of laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication and the cost-effectiveness of this technique in perspective of its learning curve and potential social-economic advantages. In addition, the benefits robot-assistance were explored in laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication and large hiatal hernia repair. It is now apparant that laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication is a durable technique up to five years after surgery but that it is not cost-effective when compared to conventional surgery. Not until sick leave days and/or operation related costs will drop is this strategy viable from an economic point of view. Regarding antireflux surgery, a large cohort of patients undergoing redo antireflux surgery was investigated to elucidate both symptomatic and objective outcome. Seventy per cent of patients was either satisfied with reoperation or reached normal objective evaluation. These figures were unknown before the start of this study. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that robot-assistance offers no subjective and objective benefits for the patient in laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication, but that usage of these systems may result in less recurrences of hiatal hernia after repair of these technically demanding disorders. This thesis also provides a systematic review on hiatal hernia repair in anticipation of a pilot study (chapter 9) in which it was demonstrated that a selective approach to antireflux procedures after hiatal hernia repair is reasonable. A randomized trial regarding this topic is therefore not advised.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The term inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is used to describe chronic inflammatory conditions of the gastro-intestinal tract. Patients suffer from abdominal pain, diarrhea, rectal bleeding and a substantial personal burden. The etiology of IBD is gradually being unraveled but remains a complex interaction between environmental, immunological and genetic factors. Mast cells and nerves can be found in close association in the intestine and the connection increases during inflammation. Understanding of the interaction between mast cells and nerves in IBD could help to provide new insights in the pathophysiology of this disorder. In this thesis a murine model was setup and validated to study the role of mast cells and nerves in the development of IBD by inducing a hypersensitivity response in the colon. This reaction is accompanied with mast cell proliferation and activation, infiltration of inflammatory cells, hypertrophy of lymphoid structures and diarrhea. The importance of mast cells was established by the observation that the responses could not be induced in mast cell-deficient (WBB6F1 W/Wv) mice. Furthermore, treatment with specific antibodies directed against the mast cell-derived pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF? could also abolish the characteristics for the response. A role for nerve-derived neuropeptide substance P was established by treatment with an antagonist against its specific receptor, NK1. Traditionally, mast cells are involved in allergic reactions and get activated by cross-linking of IgE molecules bound on the mast cell surface. However, not all hypersensitivity responses are associated with increased circulating levels of IgE. It was demonstrated that antigen-specific immunoglobulin-free light chains (IgLC) was capable of inducing mast cell activation by itself providing evidence for mast cell activation in non-IgE-mediated disorders. In the newly described murine colitis model a prominent role is established for IgLC by demonstrating that treatment with the specific antagonist for IgLC led to the abrogation of the hypersensitivity response in the colon. Since mast cells and nerves are highly associated and both described to be involved in hypersensitivity reactions, a role for IgLC in inducing neuronal activation was hypothesized. In this thesis it is described that IgLC can bind specifically to mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. Subsequent activation with the corresponding antigen resulted in a gradual increase in intracellular Ca2+ suggesting that the neuron gets activated. These data reveal a new physiological role for IgLC in eliciting antigen-specific neuronal activation and thereby amplification of the inflammatory response. Clinical relevance for IgLC is provided by demonstrating that serum concentrations of IgLC are increased in patients suffering from IBD and another gastro-intestinal disorder, irritable bowel syndrome. The data obtained in this thesis present new insight in the mast cell-nerve interactions in gastro-intestinal disorders and the novel murine model supplies a helpful tool to elucidate on the mechanism behind this interaction.'],\n",

In a thesis titled ‘Detection of COPD in smokers’ the results of 6 studies in middle-aged male smokers, conducted between 1998 and 2003 in IJsselstein, a town in the center of The Netherlands, are presented. At the baseline survey, among 702 male smokers, mean age 50 years, the prevalence of previously undetected COPD defined according to the GOLD criteria was high (30%). Smokers with undetected disease predominantly experienced mild airflow obstruction (87%). In multivariate regression analysis only age and cough were independently related to the presence of mild COPD. The ability of these determinants to discriminate subjects without COPD from those with mild COPD was relatively poor (ROC area 0.65). In 2003, 33 of 399 participants developed moderate COPD, i.e. a cumulative incidence of 8.3%. Notably, limitations of physical functioning measured by the MRC dyspnoea scale correlated more strongly with quality of life than the COPD severity staging. The risk of developing moderate COPD in smokers with baseline mild COPD was 5 times higher than in those with baseline normal spirometry (1 in 5 vs. 1 in 25). Age, cough, smoking before the age of 16 years, and ? 1 recent GP consultations because of lower respiratory tract (LRT) complaints were independently associated with development of moderate COPD. A prediction rule, based on these 4 patients characteristics, showed a reasonable discriminative ability (ROC area 0.72). Taking a cut-off of ? 2 points would identify as much as 79% (26/33) of the smokers actually developing moderate COPD in the next 5 years and 52% of the smokers not developing moderate COPD. Among smokers 45-64 years of age, nationwide screening in The Netherlands was expected to offer approximately 195,000 newly detected cases with COPD in one year and case finding in general practice among smokers with respiratory tract complaints over 78,000 new cases. Screening however showed a less favorable balance of costs and effects than case finding. The cost-effectiveness of intensive smoking cessation therapy – costs per newly detected subject with COPD who remained abstinent during at least 1 year - was markedly more favorable than the cost-effectiveness of short smoking cessation therapy. Main recommendations: - Intensifying smoking cessation interventions targeted at smokers with a high risk of developing COPD (55-64 years of age, smoking before the age of 16 years, respiratory symptoms) and at smokers with physician diagnosed COPD, should be encouraged. - Screening for COPD in middle-aged smokers can not be recommended. Case finding seems an attractive alternative, provided that intensive smoking cessation therapy is logistically possible and drug treatment for nicotine addiction is reimbursed. - Health care resources should preferably be applied to facilitate additional measures to prevent uptake of smoking or encourage smoking cessation in the population at large rather than to develop COPD screening programs in ‘healthy’ smokers.'],\n",

The process of lymphatic metastasis is, however, not well understood. This thesis examines the function of lymphatic vessels in relation to cancer progression and metastasis. The specific aim of these studies is to analyze how vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-C-induced lymphatics function and contribute to metastasis, and what the role of nitric oxide is in these processes. The larger aim of these studies is to determine if these molecular pathways are suitable therapeutic targets in cancer patients and in what clinical stages they would be useful. The experiments use several murine models that allow in vivo observation of the normal and tumor microlymphatic circulation. The results show, first, that abnormal lymphatics already start to occur in early stages of cancer. Second, that VEGF-C-induced tumor lymphatics exhibit abnormal drainage patterns and elevated lymph flow levels, as well as increased delivery of metastatic tumor cells to the lymph nodes. Third, that nitric oxide affects physiological lymph flow and tumor lymph vessel growth.

       "  'Description': ['Chest radiography (CXR) and abdominal ultrasound (US) are two widely used diagnostic imaging techniques in Western societies. General practitioners (GPs) in The Netherlands annually request approximately 500,000 CXRs and 200,000 abdominal US, and therefore clearly place a burden on health care. Besides, diagnostic investigations may lead to incidental findings, or to additional unnecessary diagnostic procedures. Little is known on the diagnostic yield of CXR and abdominal US in patients referred by GPs. The objective of this thesis was to determine the clinical effectiveness of CXR and upper abdominal US in general practice. Large part of this thesis was based on a prospective cohort study conducted from April 2003 to December 2004, with the participation of 78 GPs in the catchment area of three general hospitals located in The Netherlands. All patients of 18 years and older who were referred for CXR or upper abdominal US by their GP were included in the study, resulting in a study population of 1300 patients (870 CXRs and 430 upper abdominal US). All GPs were asked to fill in a standardized form before and after the radiological investigation, including information on the suspected diagnosis, and proposed patient management. Clinically relevant abnormalities were found in 24% of the CXRs. Anticipated patient management changed in 60% of the patients following CXR. The main changes included fewer referrals to a medical specialist (from 26% to 12%), a reduction in initiation or change in therapy (from 24% to 15%), and more frequent reassurance (from 25% to 46%). A change in patient management occurred more frequently in patients with complaints of cough, exhibited abnormalities during physical examination, or a suspected diagnosis of pneumonia. Pneumonia was diagnosed by GPs in 35 of 192 primary care patients suspected of pneumonia (18%), of whom 27 patients (14%) had a positive CXR, and 8 patients (4%) a negative CXR, however with an assumed high probability of pneumonia by the GP. CXR clearly influenced the diagnosis of pneumonia by the GP in 53% of the patients: CXR ruled out pneumonia in 47%, and the probability of pneumonia substantially increased in 6% of the patients. Anticipated patient management changed after CXR in 69% of the patients. Clinically relevant abnormalities were found in 29% of the abdominal US, mainly cholelithiasis. Anticipated patient management changed in 64% of the patients following abdominal US. Abdominal US substantially reduced the number of intended referrals to a medical specialist (from 45% to 30%), and more patients could be reassured by their GP (from 15% to 43%). A change in anticipated patient management occurred more frequently in patients with a prior cholecystectomy. Almost 50% of the patients were referred for abdominal US because of a clinical suspicion of gallstones. Cholelithiasis was detected with US in 29% of the patients with, and 11% without a clinical suspicion of gallstones. Marked differences were found in signs and symptoms of patients suspected of gallstones with and without cholelithiasis detected on abdominal US, and in patients with expected and unexpected gallstones.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The Dutch prevention policy document 2004-2007 expresses the need for more disease prevention interventions in the curative domain of health care. In hospitals the dietician is traditionally involved in preventive activities. The recent focus on prevention provides an opportunity to reflect on what facts and principles should guide priorities in hospital-based dietetic practices. This thesis consists of a collection of studies addressing patient selection based on future risks (prognosis), selection of interventions based on evidence for effectiveness (proof) and principles for priority setting based on a critical appraisal of the available scientific data and guidance of ethical values (priorities). The central question in this thesis is: What information, knowledge and values are needed to guarantee the quality of priority decisions in a hospital-based dietetic department? Chapter two presents two studies on undernutrition due to the gastrointestinal side-effects of intensive chemotherapy and total body irradiation in oncohaematological patients. The results may help dieticians to improve selection of patients who benefit either from parenteral nutrition support during admission (chapter 2.1) or from a more intensive counselling program during the recovery phase post-transplant (chapter 2.2) in order to prevent in-hospital complications as well as loss of (quality of) life time. The two studies in chapter three add to our knowledge on the effect sizes of specific dietary and lifestyle changes to prevent premature death in patients with coronary artery disease. The results show that effect sizes of dietary and lifestyle changes are relevant and comparable to the effects of routine prophylactic pharmacological treatments. Chapter four concerns patient selection policies of dietetic departments. Priority decisions should be guided by reflection on ethical values such as beneficence, autonomous choice and distributive justice and be based on the best available evidence. Professional accountability may be facilitated by explicit choices, transparent policy documents and openness for feedback. Exploring the implications, it is stated that at least three societal factors in western societies should be weighed in the priorities of hospital-based dieticians: the large burden of cardiovascular diseases, the substantial health disparities between socio-economic groups and the increasing frequency of unhealthy dietary behaviours. We conclude that priority decisions should be based on reliable information on the (future) needs of all relevant patient groups, knowledge about evidence-based benefits of dietary interventions and a clear vision on relevant ethical values. For those making the priority decisions, competencies related to appraisal of scientific data, ethical deliberation, coping with social diversity and quality management are essential.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Growth hormone stimulates bone healing Bone is one of the few tissues capable of complete regeneration. The mechanisms behind this phenomenon are of great interest not only in understanding the process of bone formation, but also in gaining insight into the regeneration of non-skeletal tissues. Distraction osteogenesis, in which bone formation is induced under gradual distraction of two bone surfaces, can be used both as an orthopaedic treatment option and as an experimental model to investigate the role of growth factors in bone regeneration. In this thesis we demonstrate that the expression of growth hormone receptor in distraction-induced bone regenerate is significantly higher than in osteotomy-induced new bone during the consolidation phase of the bone regenerate. We conclude that up-regulation of growth hormone receptor expression may enhance sensitivity to endogenous systemic growth hormone and thus promote consolidation of the bone regenerate after distraction osteogenesis. Based on these findings we hypothesized that local continuous growth hormone administration stimulates bone healing in a canine critical-sized bone defect model. Treatment with growth hormone resulted in healing of bone defects, but without an additional effect of local infusion. Growth hormone administration increased circulating levels of insulin-like growth factor-I and insulin-like growth factor-II. We conclude that continuous infusion with growth hormone stimulates bone healing in this critical-sized bone defect model. In addition to a direct effect of growth hormone, increased plasma concentrations of insulin-like growth factor-I and insulin-like growth factor-II most likely induce bone formation. Commercially available immunoassay kits for osteocalcin and carboxyterminal cross-linked telopeptide of type I collagen were evaluated in monitoring bone formation and bone resorption, respectively, during distraction osteogenesis. Plasma levels of these markers did not reflect the differences in the amount of newly formed bone induced by a distraction procedure or healing of an osteotomy. We conclude that the bone markers osteocalcin and carboxyterminal cross-linked telopeptide of type I collagen are not effective in monitoring bone formation and bone resorption in this canine model of distraction osteogenesis. Delayed-image bone scintigraphy was evaluated in quantitatively assessing distraction-induced bone formation. Distraction osteogenesis and bone healing of an osteotomy resulted in increased delayed-image scintigraphy ratios not only in the affected crus, but also in the adjacent femur. Delayed-image bone scintigraphy was not effective in differentiating between the amounts of newly formed bone. We conclude that delayed-image bone scintigraphy is not adequately sensitive in quantitatively monitoring bone formation, but may be useful as an early predictor of bone healing. Incongruity of the elbow joint and osteoarthritis of the elbow and antebrachiocarpal joint are major complicating factors in treating antebrachial growth deformities in dogs. Treatment with a circular external skeletal fixation system and a lengthening procedure was effective in correcting angular and rotational growth deformities. Nevertheless, it was not possible to completely restore all antebrachial length deficits. Initial elbow osteoarthritis, initial function, and radial and ulnar length deficits were identified as prognostic factors in dogs with antebrachial growth deformities. These factors should be addressed to predict the functional outcome of treatment with a lengthening procedure.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['New drugs in general practice: prescribing patterns and external influences'],\n",
       "  'Description': [\"In this thesis several studies are presented with the objective to detect and elucidate the patterns by which new drugs are prescribed by general practitioners (GPs). Furthermore, we studied the influences of medical specialists and community pharmacists as important factors on the GP's decision to prescribe new drugs during the first six moths after the drug's market introduction. The reason for why it is important to study the dynamics of prescribing new drugs is that even after years of extensive clinical testing in very specific patients there is still a high degree of uncertainty about the new drug's surplus value in medical practice when the new drug is introduced on the market. This uncertainty not only applies to the new drug's clinical effectiveness, but also to its safety profile when used by 'normal' patients and its socio-economic impact on society in general. The individual and fairly rational decisions of GPs to prescribe new drugs to specific patients may have unintentional consequences in the general patient population. GPs may decide that a new drug is the best option for his/her unique patient that failed to respond satisfactory to older drugs. However, if the majority of the GPs makes similar decisions this can result in the new drug being prescribed to patients for whom the drugs was not developed in the first place. The studies in this thesis resulted in three important findings. First, a small group of GPs seems, despite all reasons to be cautious, responsible for a substantial proportion of all early new drugs prescriptions within the first six months after the drug's market introduction. However, the GP's decisions to prescribe a new drug seem to be very drug dependent. Prescribing one new drug does not seem to be a strong predictor for the GP to prescribe other new drugs as well. This finding contradicts with the concept of the early adopters as being related to a general innovative predisposition. Second, our findings contradict the general and expected concept that the diffusion of new drugs generally follows a two-step model, with hospital specialists as the innovators and GPs as the followers. Although the influence of hospital specialists is clearly visible for new drugs, and often greater than for existing older drugs, the rapid uptake of new drugs may not always be specialist induced. GPs themselves are responsible for a considerable amount of all early prescriptions for new drugs. Third, GPs that participate in pharmacotherapeutic audit meetings with the community pharmacists working in the same neighbourhood prescribe less new drugs. The professional collaboration between GPs and pharmacists seem to be an effective way to control early new drug prescribing in general practice. However, it is vital that GPs and pharmacists set common goals on how to optimise pharmacotherapy. This concordance should be reflected in PTAMs that result in concrete decisions with auditing of GP prescribing behaviour. Pharmacists should take up an active role in organising PTAMs to extent their influence on drug prescribing.\"],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Processes of care in paediatric rehabilitation'],\n",
       "  'Description': [\"In this thesis the paediatric rehabilitation treatment process in the Netherlands is described with a focus on the parents' perspective. To what extent are parents involved in the different stages of the paediatric rehabilitation treatment process? What is being done in treatment? Is there a clear relation between treatment activities and parent identified problems? Are parents satisfied about the services they and their child have received? Knowing how theories about care provision have been operationalized in clinical practice will help to sharpen guidelines regarding family-centred care and will help to further improve the quality of paediatric rehabilitation care. This thesis provides the Dutch paediatric rehabilitation field with three valid and reliable self-administered measures of the family-centredness and client-centredness of services: the Measure of Processes of Care (MPOC-56 and MPOC-20), the Measure of Processes of Care for Service Providers (MPOC-SP), and the Giving Youth a Voice Questionnaire (GYV-20). Interviews with 75 parents offer detailed information on parent satisfaction with received rehabilitation services, their involvement in the care process and parents' suggestions to improve their involvement in paediatric rehabilitation care. The data show that parents are to a large extent involved in all stages of the treatment process in Dutch paediatric rehabilitation centres. The average level of parent satisfaction about received services is high. According to the interviewed parents the communication between professionals and parents, parent involvement in goal setting, and parent involvement in treatment could be improved upon. Finally, a single case observational study in five school-aged children with complex needs provides information about tuning and transparency of the rehabilitation treatment process. Five randomly selected subjects with cerebral palsy were observed in detail during physical, occupational, and speech therapy, and their written reports were studied. Parent identified problems, treatment goals, and treatment activities were linked to the ICF components, domains and categories, and the amount of agreement was determined by code comparison. The analyses indicated some tuning of parent identified problems, goals and activities in all subjects, but only four of the treatment activities were perfectly tuned to treatment goals as well as to parent identified problems. The three main topics within this thesis, development of valid measures of the family-centredness of care, parent involvement in the care process, and tuning and transparency of care, strongly support a successful implementation of family-centred care in the Netherlands. Nevertheless, a lot of the work still has to be done. Parent participation in their child's care process can be enhanced, and the tuning and transparency of the paediatric rehabilitation treatment process can improve much when limiting conditions -of which time and money are most important- are removed, when the right tools are provided with a guided implementation, and when scientific research provides the working field with a scientific justification for interventions, preferably in cooperation with clinical workers.\"],\n",

In the developed world viral bronchiolitis is the most common cause of hospitalization among infants, 70% of these are associated with RSV. In recent years the realization is growing that RSV also is a considerable disease burden on adults as well. At the moment there is no effective antiviral therapy or an effective vaccine available against RSV infection. The development of a safe and working vaccine would greatly benefit from a better understanding of the interactions between the virus and its host. RSV is a negative sense, single-stranded RNA virus, part of the family of Paramyxoviridae, subfamily Pneumovirinae, genus Pneumovirus. Two closely related viruses Bovine Repiratory Syncytial virus (BRSV) and Pneumonia Virus of Mice (PVM) cause in their hosts, cattle and mice respectively, clinical symptoms reminiscent of RSV disease in humans. The aim of the research described in this thesis was to gain better insight in the (cellular) immunological responses of the hosts against pneumoviruses. Three models were used to examine the cellular immunity against pneumoviral infection, RSV in mice, BRSV in cattle, and a relatively new model, PVM in mice. Since the murine RSV model relies heavily on BALB/c mice, we have investigated the cellular immunity against RSV in C57BL/6. Five RSV-specific CD8 T cell epitopes were identified. Using the BRSV cattle infection model, the antiviral CD8 T cell reponses are analyzed. In the last model, PVM in mice, the first antiviral CD8 and CD4 T cell responses are described and their role in protection against PVM infection is examined. The results obtained with PVM in mice argue that it could represent a promising small animal model to elucidate pneumovirus host interactions.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Local radionuclide therapy using radioactive microspheres is a promising therapy for patients suffering from liver malignancies. In contrast to normal liver tissue, which receives most of its blood flow from the portal vein, liver malignancies are almost exclusively dependent on arterial blood supply. Based on this difference in blood supply, it has been demonstrated that radioactive microspheres with a diameter between 20 and 50 mm that are injected into the hepatic artery, selectively lodge in and around the tumours and thereby irradiate the surrounding tissue. The treatment of cancer with holmium-166 loaded microspheres has obvious advantages over the use of other radionuclides, because holmium is the only element, which can be easily neutron-activated to a beta- and gamma-emitter with a logistically favourable half-life (26.8 h), and it can also be visualized by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Using a solvent evaporation technique, non-radioactive holmium-165 can be incorporated into poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) microspheres as its acetylacetonate complex (HoAcAc). In a subsequent step, the microspheres (Ho-PLLA-MS) can be neutron activated. Before Ho-PLLA-MS can be clinically applied in patients, the pharmaceutical quality of the microspheres must be well defined, and in addition, the entire production procedure should be in compliance with the Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) regulations. The setup of a GMP production process resulted in Ho-PLLA-MS batches of which the pharmaceutical characteristics (residual solvents, possible bacterial contaminations and endotoxins) were in compliance with the requirements of the European Pharmacopoeia. Moreover, the administration of Ho-PLLA-MS must not lead to toxic effects. A biocompatibility study in healthy rats showed that neutron-irradiated Ho-PLLA-MS had a good biocompatibility. An in vitro degradation study showed that the degradation of Ho-PLLA-MS resulted in the formation of holmium lactate. Lanthanides, among which holmium, offer great opportunities for new anticancer therapies that can be visualized with different imaging modalities. Therefore, also other lanthanide-loaded particles have been designed. Holmium-loaded alginate microspheres with a mean size of 160 mm can be used therapeutically for embolization and, when radioactive, for local radiotherapy of tumours. The preparation and characterisation of holmium-loaded liposomes for was investigated and showed that these liposomes could be used for multilimodality imaging and cancer therapy. Liposomes formulations were successfully labelled with radioactive holmium, allowing local radionuclide therapy and visualisation with a gamma camera. The incorporation of gadolinium acetylacetonate resulted in a strong effect on the relaxivity of the liposomes, allowing their detection with MRI. In conclusion, the preclinical research described in this thesis demonstrates that regarding the pharmaceutical quality and biocompatibility of Ho-PLLA-MS clinical research can be initiated. Furthermore, the possibility to image therapeutic radionuclides like holmium with different modalities such as gamma cameras and MRI offers great opportunities for the development of other advanced radionuclide cancer therapies.'],\n",

       "  'Description': [\"The vast majority of respiratory tract (RT) symptoms such as cough, sore throat and earache are self-limiting (viral) infections. Despite this self-limiting character, in the Netherlands antibiotics are prescribed in about one out of every three RT episodes. A further rationalisation of antibiotic use by GPs is indicated, while inappropriate prescribing of antibiotics yields risk of side-effects, unnecessary utilisation of health services, encouraging patients to re-consult their GP for subsequent RT episode, and development of antimicrobial resistance. It is well established that a patient's decision to contact the GP, and the GP's management decisions are influenced by both the patients' and the GPs' views and by the way in which patients and GPs communicate with each other. A better insight in patients' and GPs' views might be fruitful to target implementation strategies and quality assurance programmes to improve antimicrobial management in general practice. The main focus of the studies presented in this thesis was to explore patients' and GPs' views on RT symptoms and antibiotics as possible determinants (amongst others) of illness behaviour, antibiotic prescribing, and international differences in outpatient antibiotic use. This thesis has shown that patients' views play a role in RT episodes. Therefore, it is important that the GP explores patient's views to avoid misinterpretation and to enhance shared decision making. Next to this,0020patients' views probably support their GPs' decision to prescribe antibiotics. This thesis also showed that GP's views are important in the management of RT episodes; GPs have to be aware that neither a single inflammation sign nor smoking by itself are sufficient reason to prescribe antibiotics in case of RT symptoms. The finding that the tendency to label RT episodes as infections is a determinant of the volume of antibiotics prescribed for RT episodes might indicate that diagnostic labelling is influenced by reasons of therapeutic justification. GPs should label RT episodes as infections when any type of infection is suspected, realising that only a minor proportion of all RT infections do warrant antimicrobial therapy. The inclination of GPs to prescribe new drugs is associated with the volume of second-choice antibiotics. Since this tendency is strongly correlated with receiving visits from pharmaceutical representatives, GPs should avoid visits from these representatives in the practice. GPs might be less concerned about patient dissatisfaction if they do not prescribe antibiotics; taking patients seriously will probably more benefit satisfaction. More consensus is needed between practice assistants' and GPs' views in order to enhance uniform disease management among practices. To achieve this, quality assurance programs might help to increase consensus and mutual understanding between GPs and practice. Finally, this thesis showed that international differences in outpatient antibiotic use can only partially be explained by differences in patients' views. Exploration of other possible determinants indicates that being more directly dependent on patients for income might be a risk factor for higher outpatient antibiotic use prescribed by GPs, while a higher degree of professional influence might be a moderating factor.\"],\n",

       "  'Description': [\"Inherited retinal disorders and posterior visual pathway abnormalities are important causes of visual impairment in children. Visual electrophysiology often is indispensable in diagnosing these conditions. This thesis shows the wide range of use of pediatric electro-ophthalmology, and demonstrates its value in establishing diagnoses and predicting the course of a disease, with consequences for the rehabilitation process. The electrophysiological results also contribute to the understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms and sometimes lead to new hypotheses. Chapter 2 describes the results of a retrospective study of 340 electro-ophthalmological investigations in children, performed without sedation or anaesthesia. The children had a mean age of 7 ± 5 years; only 4% of the examinations failed because of lack of compliance. The most frequently established disorders were tapetoretinal dystrophy, congenital stationary night blindness, and cone dystrophy. In 26 children (9%) a previously established diagnosis was changed; in 20 of them leading to a change of prognosis. These diagnostic changes profoundly influenced the rehabilitation process. Chapter 3 reports on a 15-year-old girl with a multi-system disorder. The electro-ophthalmological findings combined with the systemic features led to the diagnosis of thiamine responsive megaloblastic anemia syndrome (TRMA). Because of this diagnosis the girl was treated with thiamine, which resulted in normalization of her blood cell count and hemoglobin concentration without further need for blood transfusions. Chapter 4 describes the ocular and electrophysiological findings in 24 patients with Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. 78% of the 24 investigated patients proved to have a retinal dysfunction; this high frequency had not been described before. Four patients had normal ERGs and VEPs, indicating phenotypic, and possibly also genetic, heterogeneity. In Chapter 5 reports on the clinical and ophthalmological characteristics of two siblings with ectrodactyly, ectodermal dysplasia, and macular dystrophy (EEM syndrome). Fundus appearance and ERGs pointed to a congenital retinal abnormality, possibly associated with Bruch's membrane pathology, rather than a progressive condition. EEM is caused by mutations in CDH3, encoding P-cadherin; mutations in this gene are also responsible for hypotrichosis with juvenile macular dystrophy (HJMD). The results suggested that EEM and HJMD may represent phenotypic heterogeneity of the same syndrome. In Chapter 6 three non-albinotic patients are described with misrouting and foveal hypoplasia. Misrouting is considered to be the hallmark of albinism, and foveal hypoplasia an important ocular feature of the condition. However, the findings in this study indicated that pigmentation is not the only decisive factor in determining misrouting and foveal hypoplasia. Misrouting in these patients may have been caused by defective genes involved in chiasm development. Furthermore, we propose the hypothesis of misrouting exerting a retrograde influence on foveal development. In Chapter 7 the characteristics of autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness (arCSNB) are described. Mutation analysis in five of the seven patients showed mutations in GRM6. The patients with mutations showed unusual ERG results when measured with 15 Hz scotopic flicker stimulation; these measurements may therefore be used in the diagnosis of arCSNB. The electrophysiological results indicated the existence of alternative pathways for rod signalling under scotopic conditions.\"],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Investigations to explore human handedness have been conducted for ages. It is still uncertain what causes people to use the left or the right hand. Clues supporting the genetic origin of handedness have been accumulating and provide the best evidence. Nevertheless, in some populations there are added proportions of left-handedness that do not seem to be explained solely by genes. The term pathological left-handedness has emerged around 30 years ago, referring to some right-handers who became left-handed due to an early life brain insult. In this thesis an attempt is made to revisit pathological left-handedness, exploring some of its origins and possible later life health outcomes. Studies on origins of left-handedness were conducted in populations which are at higher risks of having early life brain damage, such as prematurely born children and survivors of childhood meningitis. Studies on possible outcomes associated with left-handedness were done in healthy populations of adults at risk for specific health consequences. Indicators of early life brain damage seemed to be related to a higher risk of becoming left-handed. Furthermore, being left-handed seemed to increase the risk of getting premenopausal breast cancer, psychological and physical distress, and mortality, especially due to cancer and cerebrovascular diseases. Studying handedness, which is only one aspect of overall laterality, is a complex process. The results of the studies in this thesis should be an inspiration for further research into the concept of pathological left-handedness.'],\n",

       "  'Description': [\"Triggered by the concern over relative high prevalences of liver tumors, skin ulcers and the viral lymphocystis disease in European flounder (Platichthys flesus) living in Dutch coastal and estuarine waters, an integrated study was initiated to investigate a possible causal relationship between chemical environmental pollution and these diseases. This thesis describes laboratory experiments in which we focused on histopathological and immunological aspects. The following working hypothesis was formulated from the results of previously conducted field and semi-field experiments: Exposure to major environmental chemical contaminants cause adverse health effects in European flounder including: - immunodeficiency, making individuals more susceptible to infectious diseases - induction of (pre)neoplastic liver lesions. European flounder proved to be a good choice for the main purpose of our laboratory experiments: filling the gap between correlative relationships (field surveys) and circumstantial evidence (semi-field study) on one side and causal relationships (laboratory studies) on the other side, linking chemical pollution and diseases in fish. Exposure to bis (tri-n-butyltin)oxide (TBTO), an organotin compound used as a biocide in anti-fouling paints, resulted in a number of effects such as a decrease in percentage of lymphocytes and total lymphocyte number in the spleen and a reduction of the absolute and relative thymus size. Also a decrease of the non-specific cytotoxic cell (NCC) activity was recorded that might facilitate the surviving of virus-infected cells and tumor cells due to diminished or absent lysis of such cells by NCCs. In the experiments with 2,3,7,8-tetra-chlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and the structurally related 3,3',4,4',5 pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB-126) also effects with possible repercussions for the effectiveness of the immune system were noted. Oral exposure to TCDD resulted in a trend in thymus size reduction, and oral exposure to PCB-126 resulted in a statistically significant reduction of relative thymus size. In both the TCDD and PCB-126 experiments strong induction of cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A) was recorded in several organs and cells, including cells of the hematopoietic system and circulating leukocytes. In literature an association between CYP1A induction and both immunotoxicity and carcinogenesis is suggested. Results from our experiments with TBTO under controlled laboratory conditions using levels that are comparable to high levels in the field indicate that TBTO is indeed a risk factor that may contribute to an increased occurrence of infectious and non-infectious diseases in wild populations. The relevance of the effects recorded in our experiments with TCDD and PCB-126 are more difficult to interpret due to aspects related to the experimental design (e.g. exposure levels, frequency and time), but a contribution of these substances to chemical-induced diseases in the real world is likely. Experiments using juvenile animals or even eggs, that are generally more susceptible to toxic effects, and long-term exposure in the case of carcinogenesis might offer a different perspective. Establishing a functional infection model is an essential prerequisite for validation of the immune status. Unfortunately, our attempts to develop a reproducible and practical infection model with the lymphocystis virus were unsuccessful.\"],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Ehrlichia ruminantium, an intracellular gram-negative rickettsia, is the causative agent of heartwater, a tick-borne disease of domestic and wild ruminants. It is a major constraint to livestock production throughout sub-Saharan Africa and the islands of Madagascar, La Réunion, Mauritius and São Tomé. The disease is also present in the Caribbean, on the French Antillean islands of Guadeloupe and Antigua, to which infected Amblyomma variegatum ticks were introduced, possibly as early as the eighteenth century. Research into heartwater was hampered for many years by the impossibility of obtaining viable E. ruminantium organisms of a defined genotype and free from contamination with mammalian cellular material. A major turning point was reached when a suitable culture system became available. However, the first in vitro culture system was exceptionally fragile, and unexplained failures used to occur frequently, causing frustrating delays in heartwater research. The work described in this thesis has provided an important contribution to improved heartwater vaccine development. A chemically completely defined medium for the continuous in vitro propagation of E. ruminantium has been described. Additional in vitro studies revealed that E. ruminantium has a broader repertoire of host cells than previously assumed. Propagation in an unusual host cell line led to the emergence of an attenuated version of the Welgevonden stock of E. ruminantium, an important basis for the development of a culture-derived heartwater vaccine. Preliminary studies on the efficacy of this vaccine indicated that sheep were fully protected against a lethal challenge with the virulent homologous stock or with any of four different heterologous stocks. Future studies aimed at development of a freeze-dried formulation would greatly improve the acceptance of a live, attenuated vaccine by the end user. Effective, reliable control of heartwater using this vaccine to prevent serious disease outbreaks could have a tremendous positive economic impact for small-scale as well as commercial farmers in South Africa.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['In vivo evaluation of therapeutic options in atopic dermatitis'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Atopic dermatitis (AD, or atopic eczema) is an inflammatory itchy skin disease. AD patients often have high serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels, T-cell activation and eosinophilia in peripheral blood. The dermal infiltrate of AD contains mainly T-cells, eosinophils and dendritic cells. Epicutaneous patch tests with aeroallergen application for 24-48 h can induce eczematous lesions in sensitized patients with AD. This is named the atopy patch test (APT). The APT is used as in vivo research model to study the mechanisms involved in the induction of eczema by inhalant allergens. AD treatment consists of application of emollients and topical corticosteroids. Other topical treatment strategies are the relatively new topical calcineurin inhibitors, tacrolimus and pimecrolimus. For more severe forms of AD, local phototherapy can be prescribed, but also oral use of ciclosporin A, corticosteroids, azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil. The overall aim of this thesis was to evaluate several therapeutic options for AD patients. We have focussed on two different systems to determine clinical efficacy 1) improvement of lesional, active AD skin and 2) inhibition of the APT as in vivo provocation model for allergic inflammation in AD. In chapter 2, medium-dose ultraviolet (UV) A1 (340-400 nm) was compared with narrow-band UVB (311 nm) phototherapy. We demonstrate that both treatment modalities are clinically equal effective. This is supported by a decrease in inflammatory cell infiltrate in both treatment groups. Based on practical advantages of NB UVB, as well as patient-friendliness, which are less heat load and shorter duration of phototherapy, the preferred choice of phototherapy for AD should be NB UVB. In chapter 3, the clinical effect of the newly developed drug mepolizumab, which is a monoclonal antibody to interleukin 5 (IL-5) aimed at eosinophil depletion, is investigated. We conclude that short-term intravenously administered treatment with mepolizumab has no clinical effect in AD patients, despite a significant decrease in peripheral blood eosinophils. Moreover, in chapter 5 we observe no inhibitory effect on the APT after mepolizumab therapy. So, despite a reduction of blood eosinophils, remaining blood eosinophils are able to migrate into the skin. Future studies are necessary to investigate if prolonged anti-IL-5 therapy (> 3 months) results in a more rigorous depletion of blood eosinophils and consequently in a decrease of tissue eosinophils. In chapter 4, two frequently used APT methods were compared. It was concluded that both APT methods can be used as in vivo model to study the initiation of allergic inflammation in AD. In chapter 6 the influence of pretreatment with topical tacrolimus 0.1% on the APT was studied and compared with pretreatment with a topical corticosteroid and with placebo. Tacrolimus was not capable to inhibit the APT reaction, in contrast to the suppressive effect of pretreatment with topical corticosteroids. This suggests that preventive treatment of non-lesional skin with tacrolimus will not be effective in AD, in contrast to topical corticosteroids.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in women with diabetes mellitus (DM) is increased. In this thesis different aspects of ASB in this patient group are described, focusing on the pathogenesis, the different methods of diagnosis, and the consequences on the long term. In the first part, it is described that the adherence of type 1-fimbriated E. coli to uroepithelial cells of women with DM is increased, compared to the adherence to uroepithelial cell of women without DM. This may play a role in the increased prevalence. It is shown that the fimH sequence, which encodes the adhesive part of type 1-fimbriae, of E. coli strains isolated from women with DM is highly homologous to the known fimH sequence of E. coli from nondiabetic patients. The resistance rates of E. coli strains isolated from the urine of diabetic women with ASB are found to be comparable to those of routine isolates from the female population in the same area. In the second part, two alternative ways to diagnose ASB are described. First, a scoring system that is based on two variables routinely obtained in daily clinical practice (duration of DM and glycosylated hemoglobin for women with DM type 1, and age and the number of symptomatic urinary tract infections in the previous year for women with DM type 2), that in combination with a urinary leukocyte count accurately predicts the presence of ASB in women with DM. Secondly, the development and validation of a real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)-based assay to diagnose E. coli bacteriuria are described. Despite the high prevalence of ASB, little is known about the possible consequences on the long term. It was investigated whether Escherichia coli bacteriuria was associated with a decline in renal function, the development of end-stage renal failure, or with hypertension in a healthy female population and in women with DM after a long-term follow-up. E. coli bacteriuria was not associated with a decline in renal function or with the development of end-stage renal failure in a population of generally healthy adult women during 12 to 14 years of follow-up. However, a strong association was found between E. coli bacteriuria and hypertension in the same population. Finally, the results of a prospective multicenter study are described that show that ASB does not lead to a faster decline in renal function or to the development of hypertension in women with DM type 1 or type 2 after six years of follow-up. Therefore, we conclude that screening of and subsequent treatment for ASB are not indicated in women with DM type 1 or type 2.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Salivary gland dysfunction is one of the prevalent side effects of the head-and-neck irradiation. The dry mouth syndrome or xerostomia predisposes a person to oral disease and discomfort and consequently to deterioted quality of life. In this thesis it was demonstrated that the implementation of a new irradiation techniques, intensity modulation radiotherapy (IMRT) can result in reduction to the mean dose to the salivary glands compared to that delivered by the conventional techniques.  IMRT yields dose distributions that conform more accurately to the 3D configuration of the target volumes and consequently spare the normal tissues. The theoretical calculation of the normal tissue complication probability for xerostomia 1 year after radiotherapy could be reduced up to 68% with the IMRT technique. Furthermore in this thesis we have developed a special MRI protocol for the follow up and the radiation damage to the salivary glands and eventually the measurement of the salivary function. A novel imaging technique was used, MR sialography. Saliva itself is imaged along the full trajectory of salivary ducts and 3-dimensional images of the salivary duct system are obtained . MR sialograms of healthy volunteers at different moments in time appeared to be reproducible. In patients, however, the MR sialograms before and after radiotherapy differed due to the radiation-induced damage to the salivary system.  This method offers a new insight to the problem because it provides spatial and functional information of   the radiation-induced xerostomia at the same time. This information could be used for a more effective IMRT treatment planning.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['The nature of emotional abnormalities in schizophrenia: Evidence from patients and high-risk individuals'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder that affects about one out of 100 people with symptoms generally emerging in early adulthood. According to the DSM-IV, schizophrenia is characterized by psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations, delusions, bizarre behavior or speech and negative symptoms such as flattening of affect. Psychotic symptoms such as hallucination and delusions are regarded as particularly characteristic for schizophrenia, although they may also occur in other psychiatric disorders. Besides these psychotic symptoms, which are often treatable with antipsychotic medication, people with schizophrenia experience negative symptoms (social withdrawal, affective flattening, apathy, alogia) and cognitive disturbances, e.g. memory dysfunction, attention problems, and emotional dysfunction. It are mainly these latter problems that cause that the majority of people with schizophrenia are unable to built up a social network, career and romantic relationships, making it one of the most invalidating psychiatric disease. Currently, the prevalent idea is that emotion processing is generally deficient in schizophrenia. Thus, the emphasis is solely on reductions or impairments. However, some studies suggest that schizophrenia is associated with a reduced ability to perceive and express emotions, with at the same time intact or even heightened emotional experience. This disjunction between emotional processes in schizophrenia was investigated in more detail. Second, this thesis dealt with investigating the presence of emotional abnormalities in individuals high on the schizophrenia spectrum continuum. Emotional abnormalities in people at high-risk for schizophrenia are hypothesized, because emotional abnormalities appear to be a core feature of schizophrenia and would therefore be expected to be present to a certain degree in high-risk individuals. Finally, we investigated the influence of social-emotional aspects on other cognitive functions, such as decision-making, in patients with schizophrenia and individuals at high-risk for schizophrenia. The most important findings are that emotional abnormalities appear to be central to schizophrenia and are also present in individuals with a liability for schizophrenia-like traits or an increased genetic risk. This suggests that emotional abnormalities can be regarded as a vulnerability marker for schizophrenia. However, these emotional abnormalities do not reflect an overall reduction in all aspect of emotion processing, i.e. perception, expression, experience and psychophysiology. Instead, schizophrenia patients and individuals at high risk report normal or higher levels of emotional experience, whereas the expression of emotions appears deficient. With respect to the perception of emotion, results depend on the type of processing that occurs, i.e. automatic, incidental processing or controlled, elaborative processing of affective information. These findings suggest a disjunction between deficits in elaborative processing of emotions on the one hand, and normal or increased emotional reactivity on the other hand. Moreover, deficits in the perception and expression of emotions appear to be consistently related to negative symptoms, such as blunted affect and social emotional withdrawal. In addition, positive symptoms might be related to an increased subjective emotional arousal. The finding of a particular pattern of emotional abnormalities in patients with schizophrenia and individuals at high risk for schizophrenia could give clues about the underlying brain pathology and ultimately the development of treatment strategies that selectively target those brain systems.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Hepatitis C in Hemophilia'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Hepatitis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with hemophilia. In our study with a follow-up of 35 years, we found that the risk for end-stage liver disease (liver failure, hepatocellular carcinoma, liver-related death) was 12% for HIV negative, and 35% for HIV coinfected patients. Although a significant proportion of hemophilia patients is at risk for long-term complications of hepatitis, many patients still have not been treated. In the Dutch hemophilia population, approximately 30-40% were not treated mainly due to fear of side effects, lack of clinical symptoms, and expected low efficacy of treatment. However, health-related quality of life was reduced in hemophilia patients with chronic hepatitis C. Thus providing an additional argument in favor of treatment, as health-related quality of life will improve after successful treatment for hepatitis C. Liver biopsies are rarely performed in hemophilia patients because of risk of bleeding, and high costs of clotting factor replacement. In order to assess liver fibrosis in the hemophilic population and identify patients eligible for antiviral therapy, we were the first to use a new, non-invasive device: the Fibroscan®. With this new technique we found an unexpected high proportion of patients with severe fibrosis or cirrhosis of approximately 35%. Many patients had significant liver damage that would not have been detected with the conventional methods like laboratory tests and ultrasonography. Based on the results of the Fibroscan® examination, approximately 25% of patients started antiviral therapy within three months. The majority of these patients had postponed antiviral therapy for years despite therapy had frequently been offered. These results indicate that the Fibroscan® may play an important role in persuading patients with significant fibrosis to start therapy. Furthermore, this technique may be used to follow patients in order to assess progression of fibrosis and determine prognosis. Conflicting data exist about the efficacy of IFN-based therapy in the hemophilic population. For many years, it was thought that patients with hemophilia would respond worse to IFN-based therapy than patients in the general population. Patients with hemophilia are often infected with HCV genotype 1, are predominantly male, have long-lasting infection, and have often high levels of viraemia. However, in our review of IFN-based therapies in the hemophilic population responses were similar to that seen in the general population. This was also corroborated in our pilot study of patients who were treated with Pegylated IFN combined with ribavirin. The sustained virological response for HIV negative and treatment naïve patients was 70%. This high response may be due to the high compliance to therapy in this population. The direct responses to antiviral therapy are precisely defined, but what are the long-term effects of this therapy? In a cohort study of approximately 300 patients, we found that all patients who achieved a sustained response after IFN-based therapy remained HCV RNA negative up to 15 years after treatment. Furthermore, none of the successfully treated patients developed liver failure or hepatocellular carcinoma. This was in contrast with patients who failed to eradicate HCV: the risk for developing end-stage liver disease was approximately 13%. In conclusion, these findings indicate that successful therapy postpones or may even prevent long-term complications of chronic hepatitis C during the first 10-15 years after therapy. However, longer follow-up is required to assess whether this favorable effect is sustained over the next decades.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Allergic asthma is an inflammatory disease characterized by bronchial hyper-responsiveness, airway inflammation, and reversible obstruction of the airways. In humans, cytokine activated eosinophils are thought to be important players in this process since they can release inflammatory mediators after cellular activation. Eosinophil differentiation, survival, and regulation of many of its cellular functions are regulated by interleukin (IL)-5, a T helper-2-derived cytokine. The IL-5 receptor (IL-5R) is expressed on the cell surface of eosinophils, and it is composed of an ?-chain that specifically binds IL-5 and a ?-chain, which is shared with the receptors for IL-3 and granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). An understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating eosinophil production and function is essential for the development of molecules that can potentially be utilized in the treatment of asthma and other eosinophil-associated diseases. In this study, we firstly elucidate the mechanisms by which IL-5 regulates cell survival. We found that binding of IL-5 to its receptor results in phosphorylation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and its effector protein kinase B (PKB/c-Akt), which have been implicated as critical mediators of cytokine-induced survival signals in other cell types. We identified PI3K-PKB downstream targets that are inhibited by IL-5 stimulation, and proposed novel mechanism describing a role for the glycogen synthase kinase –3 (GSK-3) and ?-catenin in eosinophils. We also studied the effects of a novel IL-5R antagonist peptide finding that it specifically inhibits IL-5-mediated signaling pathways as well as eosinophils functions including chemotaxis and cell adhesion. Furthermore, we analyzed the use of protein transduction domains (PTD) to deliver proteins than can inhibit eosinophil intracellular signaling, and thereby eosinophil function. Our work contributes to the development of safe antagonists that specifically target IL-5 and eosinophil function. Alternative therapies are necessary for the treatment of asthmatic responses since the continued use of oral steroids could cause severe side effects.'],\n",

The aims of the studies presented in this thesis were to assess: 1 the anatomical complications, its frequency and the influence of risk factors. 2 the pre- and intraoperative factors influencing the success of the TVT. 3 the long-term outcome of TVT in women in whom the TVT procedure was their first incontinence surgery. 4 the outcome after a follow-up of three years of TVT in women with previous incontinence or prolapse surgery. 5 the long-term outcome of TVT on urge incontinence and other forms of irritative bladder symptoms. 6 the outcome with a follow-up of three years of the TVT procedure in women with concomitant pelvic surgery. 7 the prevalence of immediate postoperative and long-term voiding difficulties (VD) after TVT. Between March 2000 and September 2001 women with an indication for a TVT procedure were asked to participate in this study. This was a long term ((3 years follow-up of all patients), multicenter prospective cohort study with 41 hospitals and 54 gynaecologists and urologists participating. RESULTS The original database comprised data from 809 women. 1 TVT is a relative safe procedure, concomitant pelvic surgery can be safely performed. Several risk factors for complications were identified. 2 General anaesthesia and inexperience of the surgeon with the TVT procedure seemed to have a negative effect on the result. Therefore, we believe that the TVT should only be performed by experienced surgeons. 3 This is the largest study which used validated disease specific health-related quality of life (HRQoL) questionnaires to asses the long term outcome of the TVT procedure. This study shows a long-term improvement of the quality of life after a TVT. 4 TVT is a valuable tool for women with recurrent stress urinary incontinence, prior prolapse surgery or both. Therefore, we think the TVT should be recommended for the treatment of recurrent stress urinary incontinence in women with previous incontinence and/or prolapse surgery. 5 This study reports the long term outcome of symptoms of frequency, nocturia, urge incontinence, overactive bladder (OAB), irritative symptoms. These symptoms are often prevalent prior to TVT and often resolve afterwards. Urge incontinence and OAB wet symptoms developed in 11% and 3% respectively and gave less improvement on the quality of life scores. Over all most symptoms resolved significantly more than they developed after TVT, resulting in a better quality of life after TVT. 6 TVT is effective for women without and with concomitant prolapse surgery, after 2 years a difference in UDI & IIQ scores could be identified. 7 Quality of life after TVT is only in part negatively influenced by the existence of VD and women who develop VD, are still significantly improved compared to their preoperative condition. Furthermore in most women the clinical course of developing urinary retention after TVT is mild.'],\n",

Minimal tumor-directed neutrophil migration was induced by IgG anti-tumor antibodies. In contrast, FcalphaRI triggered massive neutrophil migration and tumor-colony destruction. Production of chemotactic factors and release of inflammatory cytokines were increased, as well, suggesting an FcalphaRI-induced autocrine loop, leading to neutrophil migration and consequent destruction of tumor-colonies. In addition, tumor-cell killing was consistently more effective via triggering of FcalphaRI, than via FcgammaRI. Taken together, neutrophil FcalphaRI might represent an effective target for antibody therapy. Successful antibody therapy against liver-metastases: In colorectal cancer, many patients will develop liver-metastases, even after successful surgical removal of the primary tumor at a time at which no visible metastases are present. Peri-operative adjuvant treatment might, therefore, help to prevent secondary disease. We studied the potential of antibody-therapy to prevent outgrowth of liver-metastases in mice. Peri-operative treatment with anti-gp75 IgG2a prevented outgrowth of B16F10 liver-metastases in more than 90% of mice. Therapeutic efficacy was maintained in either C1q-, or CR3-deficient mice, but was abrogated in FcRgamma chain-deficient mice, which lack all activatory FcgammaR. These results indicate that interactions with activatory FcgammaR are necessary for successful antibody therapy of cancer. Because antibody therapy was still effective in FcgammaRI-/-, FcgammaRIII-/- and FcgammaRI/III-/- mice, an important role for the newly identified FcgammaRIV is supported.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The studies described in this thesis suggest that peptidoglycan (PG) is involved in initiation and progression of atherosclerosis. PG is an antigen that can be found in large amounts in the Gram-positive bacterial wall and only in small amounts in the Gram-negative bacterial wall. PG is able to stimulate the Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), a receptor that plays an important role in the innate immune system. In the normal situation PG is present in the intestinal mucosal flora, but under certain pathological circumstances PG is able to promote chronic inflammation at non-mucosal sites in the body. IgM, IgG and IgA antibodies against PG are present in serum of healthy subjects. However, in atherosclerotic patients the IgM antibody levels against PG are lower compared to control subjects. Furthermore, IgM antibody levels against PG are negatively associated with intima-media thickness in coronary arteries and therefore with more pronounced human atherosclerotic disease. We found these associations in a cross-sectional study, but these IgM antibody levels against PG are not prognostic markers for development of adverse cardiovascular events after elective coronary angioplasty. We also showed that adventitial fibroblasts and human coronary arteries express TLR2 and that TLR2 stimulation of adventitial fibroblasts increases expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, like IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and MCP-1. In addition, in wild-type mice Pam3Cys-SK4 stimulation promotes intimal lesion formation, which is clearly TLR2-mediated since TLR2-/- mice show no significant increase in intimal hyperplasia. In ApoE-/- mice TLR2 stimulation increases development of atherosclerotic plaques. In addition to recognition by TLR2, degradation products of PG can also be recognized by intracellular NOD and Nalp proteins. We found that NOD1 and NOD2 protein expression is significantly increased in human atherosclerotic lesions and in those lesions NOD2 protein is present in macrophages within inflammatory areas and in endothelial cells lining the vessel wall. NOD1 protein expression is associated with the presence of smooth muscle cells (SMC) and collagen, but also with macrophages when SMC are absent. Furthermore, both NOD1 and NOD2 protein levels are inversely associated with matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 levels and positively with MMP-8 and MMP-9 levels. Previous studies from our group showed that PG is present in human atherosclerotic plaques that reveal an inflammatory, vulnerable phenotype and that PG is present in the macrophage-rich regions of those plaques. In this thesis we extend this finding by showing that peripheral blood monocytes that are stimulated with PG increase expression and functionality of integrins on their surface, thereby promoting firm adhesion of the monocytes to endothelial cells and migratory properties. Furthermore, peritoneal macrophages stimulated with PG in vitro show increased homing into atherosclerotic plaques in vivo. These studies not only suggest that PG promotes atherosclerotic lesion development and progression; they also show that PG enhances accumulation of monocytes and/or macrophages at sites of inflammation thereby promoting the formation of vulnerable plaques. These vulnerable plaques are prone to rupture and thereby promote the formation of a thrombus. Such a thrombus eventually might cause a myocardial infarction or stroke.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The expanding use of prenatal diagnosis and improvements in prenatal screening lead to an increasing number of fetal abnormalities diagnosed in early pregnancy. While the majority of parents who have opted for prenatal diagnosis will be reassured that their child does not have the anomaly the test was aimed at, some parents will be confronted with the diagnosis of fetal anomaly. Therapeutic options are limited and these parents will have to decide whether they will continue the pregnancy and have a severely handicapped child or a child that will die soon after birth, or whether they will terminate this otherwise desired pregnancy. Parents who opt for a termination of the pregnancy (TOP) decide on their own loss of pregnancy. In the Netherlands this complex and painful decision is currently made 500 to 550 times a year. We conducted a postal questionnaire study, in 347 (196 f and 151 m) parents who had undergone a TOP 2 to 7 years before and in 386 parents (217 f and 169 m) who were asked for participation at time of hospitalization for termination of the pregnancy and who filled out questionnaires 4, 8 and 15 months after termination. Aims of the study: 1. to get insight into the decision-making process and in the short and long term psychological consequences. 2. to identify factors influencing psychological morbidity. 3. to compare the reactions of women and men and assess the interaction within the couples. 4. to formulate guidelines, which may minimize the emotional impact associated with termination of a pregnancy. Conclusions: - Parents experience termination of pregnancy for fetal anomaly more as a traumatic than a loss event. Psychological distress following TOP is initially higher in women than in their partners, but long-term outcome does not differ greatly. Parents with problematic adjustment in the first period after TOP have a higher risk of psychological morbidity in the long term. Although most parents adapt well to TOP a significant number (in women about 20%) keep long-term posttraumatic stress complaints. - Risk factors for long-term psychological morbidity are: inadequate partner support (mainly for women), low level of self efficacy, high level of doubt in the decision period, perceived pressure at the decisional process, more advanced gestational age, having a religion, a fetal anomaly presumably compatible with life, and a low level of education. - Down’s syndrome, being the most frequent cause of TOP, did not negatively affect parental outcome. - For most of the parents, the termination did not affect their future reproductive intentions, and regret about the decision was rare. This was also reflected by a positive attitude towards a next pregnancy and prenatal testing during such a pregnancy. Recommendations: Parents need to be informed about the risk of serious psychological distress in the first period after TOP, but also about the fact that most people adapt well on the long-term. The existence of patient self-help groups must be pointed out to them. The partner’s role in the adjustment is very important and therefore both partners should be equally involved in counselling. Clinicians should give extensive information as to the severity of the fetal anomaly. Parents should be offered psychological help in case of a high level of doubt in the decisional period and in case of serious distress in the first period after TOP.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Athero-Express is a tissue bank study, designed to investigate the expression of atherosclerotic derived biological variables in relation to the long-term outcome of patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy. Its design includes both cross-sectional and follow-up studies, the results from which should expand our current knowledge of atherosclerotic disease. Due to the relatively large sample size, it should be possible to correct potential confounders whilst exploring protein and RNA expression in relation to plaque characteristics. The objectives of Athero-Express include the identification of new plaque markers, patient risk profiles and treatment strategies as well as the early detection of “patients at risk”. Follow-up studies, in which the long term outcome in relation to local protein and RNA expression are studied, will take several years to complete, due to the large sample size required to correct confounding. For this reason, cross sectional studies are likely to be undertaken in the first years of the study. Cross-sectional studies can be used to validate any proteins of interest, which, from either in vitro or in vivo studies, appear to be related to the progression of atherosclerotic disease. Future follow-up studies will focus on proteomic analyses. These, in turn, should result in the discovery of new proteins of interest. To date, Athero-Express has proved a successful bio-bank. Several cross sectional studies have already been performed. Its power is based on the large number of patients included. At this moment, proteomic analyses are being performed in Singapore. We expect mass spectrometry proteomics to reveal new, as yet unrecognised proteins, differentially expressed in 1- traditionally defined fibrous, stable plaques versus atheromatous, inflammatory.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['In dogs, leishmaniasis caused by the protozoan parasite Leishmania infantum is a serious and potentially fatal disease. This parasite can also cause zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis in children and immunocompromised adults. A vaccine for dogs would not only be of great value in veterinary medicine but could potentially also reduce the incidence of zoonotic disease since dogs are the main reservoir for this parasite. In order to be able to test the efficacy of candidate vaccines, we have established challenge models for L.infantum in hamsters and dogs in our laboratory. Intravenous injection of a relatively high dose of in vitro cultured promastigotes (the stage transmitted by the sandfly vector) was found to reliably infect dogs and produce clinical symptoms in most of them. A detailed and prolonged follow-up of challenged dogs was found to be necessary for reliable results. Hamsters were found to be extremely susceptible to the infection and are therefore more suited as a model for L.infantum than mice. Increasing the challenge dose was found to decrease the prepatent period. A relatively high dose of parasites was therefore chosen as the standard since this enables the use of small groups of animals and decreases the follow-up period. Cysteine peptidases (CP’s) are known virulence factors in many parasites, including Leishmania. Previous research has indicated the protective potential both of CP knockout strains and of recombinant CP’s when used to vaccinate mice against L.mexicana. Two different L.infantum vaccine candidates were tested. A live attenuated strain of L.infantum, generated by targeted gene disruption of cysteine peptidase genes, was tested in hamsters. Although the strains were found to have attenuated virulence, protection could not be detected. Furthermore a formulation containing recombinant CP proteins and recombinant canine Interleukin-12 was tested in dogs; protection was again not found. More research is needed to find an effective vaccine for canine leishmaniasis. It is very important to test (new) candidate vaccines in dogs since it appears that results in the mouse model can not be directly translated to the dog. Results of dog vaccination studies are important, irrespective of the result, because this can increase knowledge of canine leishmaniasis and subsequently direct future research.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The principle aim of this thesis was to identify genes involved in intracranial aneurysms and subsequent aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) especially those implicated in the maintenance of the integrity of the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the arterial wall. These genes were identified using a study population with a familial preponderance of the disease. In part 1 of the thesis this study population and its familial risk factor were described. The population attributable risks of the known risk factors for aneurysmal SAH were outlined. Characteristics of intracranial aneurysms (i.e. size and number) in patients with a familial form of aneurysmal SAH and those with the non-familial or sporadic form were compared. Familial aneurysms appeared generally larger at time of rupture and more often multiple than non-familial or sporadic aneurysms. Demographic and clinical features in patients of families with familial intracranial aneurysms and different patterns of inheritance were compared and no differences were found. In addition, the ages of patients with SAH in affected parent-child pairs were compared and the age at time of SAH in parents was significantly higher than in their children. Finally, subtle manifestations of connective tissue or the ECM disease between patients with aneurysmal SAH and controls were compared to assess whether intracranial aneurysms is not a localized disruption but may rather represent a more general laxity of the connective tissue and ECM. Patients with ruptured intracranial aneurysms had a higher degree of joint mobility compared to controls. Part 2 described the identification of genes, especially those implicated in the maintenance of the integrity of the ECM of the arterial wall, involved in the occurrence of intracranial aneurysms and aneurysmal SAH. Allelic association with intracranial aneurysms was demonstrated for several functional and positional candidate genes of the ECM: versican (CSPG2), serpine1 (PAI1), perlecan (HSPG2), fibrillin (FBN2) and collagen 4A1 (COL4A1). A genome-wide linkage study was performed in a large Dutch family with intracranial aneurysms and linkage was shown to a locus on chromosome 1 and on chromosome X. A literature study describing and comparing the genomic loci identified in whole genome linkage studies on intracranial, thoracic and abdominal aortic aneurysms in search of possible common genetic risk factors for the three types of aneurysms, showed five chromosomal regions that may play a role in the pathogenesis of two or more aneurysmal types. Part 3 explored the utilization of genetic factors in clinical studies on aneurysmal SAH. The insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and the tumor necrosis factor-A (TNF-A) genes that are expressed after ischemia and that influence recovery after ischemia in the animal model of ischemia appeared associated with outcome in patients after aneurysmal SAH. Analyzing factors involved in the occurrence of rebleeding and secondary cerebral ischemia after aneurysmal SAH no association of genes modifying coagulation with risk of secondary cerebral ischemia and rebleeding after aneurysmal SAH could be demonstrated.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['The metabolic syndrome and vascular disease'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['In the Western population cardiovascular diseases are the most common cause of mortality and morbidity. There are several important risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, among them hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes and obesity. The clustering of cardiovascular risk factors associated with central obesity is often referred to as the metabolic syndrome. Due to different visions regarding the definitions, the underlying pathophysiology and the clinical usefulness, the metabolic syndrome attracts much attention of clinical research and clinicians. It has been shown that in apparently healthy individuals the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome is 20-25%, and the coming years the prevalence is expected to increase due to an increased prevalence of obesity. The metabolic syndrome is associated with a 2 to 3 fold increased risk for the development of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. In this thesis it is shown that in patients with manifest vascular disease the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome is nearly 50%. We also conclude that in patients with already manifest vascular diseases, the metabolic syndrome is associated with more advanced vascular damage as measured by indicators for increased (cardio)vascular risk. Adiponectin, produced by adipocytes, is involved in glucose metabolism and also has direct anti-atherogenic properties. The relationship between adiponectin and the metabolic syndrome and several estimates of obesity was demonstrated in patients with coronary artery disease in this thesis. Elevated iron stores are associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus and the metabolic syndrome, but the mechanistic link is not clear yet. Adipose tissue could be involved in the development of insulin resistance by the changed production of adipokines, so it could be hypothesized that elevated iron concentrations are involved in the development of the metabolic syndrome by interfering in adipocyte function. We indeed demonstrate that body iron stores, as reflected by ferritin levels, are significantly associated with the metabolic syndrome and adipocyte dysfunction, as measured by decreased adiponectin levels. The presence of coronary collaterals may have beneficial effects during myocardial ischemia and may improve cardiovascular outcome in patients with coronary artery disease. Impaired collateral formation could be one of the reasons for the increased cardiovascular risk in patients with the metabolic syndrome. However, we show that there is no significant association between the metabolic syndrome or insulin resistance and the presence of coronary collaterals in patients with documented coronary artery disease. Furthermore, we show that in patients with the metabolic syndrome combination therapy of low-dose simvastatin and ezetimibe preserves postprandial endothelial function contrary to high dose simvastatin monotherapy, whereas the same reduction in (fasting) plasma LDL-cholesterol is obtained after 6 weeks treatment. We also find that allowance for the use of lipid-lowering drugs in the NCEP-definition may identify an additional group of patients at elevated risk for cardiovascular diseases and diabetes and that the NCEP and IDF definitions identify metabolic syndrome patients with different cardiovascular risk profiles.'],\n",

       "  'Description': [\"Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PV) literary means augmentation of the vertebral body  through the skin. The main goal is partial or complete pain relief. Nowadays, the most frequent indication for treatment is a painful invalidating osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture (VCF), not responding to conservative treatment. In PV the collapsed vertebral body is stabilized by the injection of bone cement. In patients with painful, invalidating osteoporotic VCF, PV is the first therapy that is directly aimed at the source of pain: the vertebral fracture. \\n\\r\\n\\tThe technical aspects of the procedure have been scientifically investigated and are optimized during the last 25 years. The complication risk of the procedure is low and depends mainly on experience of the operator, the used inclusion criteria, optimal fluoroscopy and the materials used. Less studied is the clinical outcome of PV. \\n\\r\\n\\tIn this thesis the literature was reviewed on prospective studies to determine the effectiveness and safety of PV in patients with painful osteoporotic VCF treated with PV. Immediate pain relief was seen in 60-100% of patients and improved to 78-100% long term (maximum 4 years). Complications were related to cementleakage's and were mostly of no clinical consequence. Serious complications were rare. Long term, PV was associated with an increased risk of fractures in adjacent vertebrae. A prospective randomized clinical intervention study was not published. \\n\\r\\n\\tOur longitudinal prospective study in 112 patients with 168 osteoporotic VCF demonstrated significant immediate and long lasting pain reduction in nearly all treated patients. A randomized prospective study assessed the short-term clinical outcome of patients with painful osteoporotic VCF treated with PV compared to optimal pain medication (OPM). Pain relief and improvement of mobility, function and spinal stature after PV was immediate and significantly better on short term compared to OPM treatment. \\n\\r\\n\\tIn the preprocedural workup of patients selected for PV, the clinical relevance of bone marrow edema (BME) in osteoporotic VCF detected by MRI is unknown. Our study showed that pain decrease after PV in patients with VCF was more frequently observed when full BME was present on preprocedural MRI. Since 71% of patients with osteoporotic VCF with absent BME responded favorably on pain, PV should not be withheld based on absence of BME alone. Postprocedural, a gradual decrease of BME in osteoporotic VCF treated with PV was apparent during 12 months MRI follow-up. Decrease of BME was unrelated to pain relief. \\n\\r\\n\\tThis thesis demonstrates that during one year follow-up after PV, 24% of patients developed new VCF at untreated levels. Most new VCF occurred within three months of PV. Half of new VCF appeared in levels adjacent to treated levels and half were symptomatic. More than two pre-existing VCF was the only independent risk factor for the development of new VCF. \\n\\r\\n\\tFinally, a future interventional application had been investigated. Navigation on 3DRX image data is feasible in transpedicular percutaneous needle introduction, and has two advantages over fluoroscopic guidance: it poses less strict requirements on the expertise of the operator and it reduces the radiation exposure to the operator.\"],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Reactive oxygen species are produced during normal mitochondrial respiration processes. Intracellular homeostasis is among other factors dependent on the balance between ROS production and antioxidant systems. When this balance is threatened or ceases to exist pathologies can arise (cancer, degenerative diseases, and reproductive disorders). In this thesis we focus on how molecular peroxidation affects the fertility characteristics of bovine cryopreserved sperm. Firstly it is described how new methodologies can be used to detect sperm plasma membrane susceptibility to peroxidative damage before and after cryopreservation processes. These techniques are useful for selection of sires to be used in insemination programmes. Furthermore it is shown that cholesterol oxidation products (COPs) are already present in ejaculated sperm, whilst for other lipid molecules such as phospholipid- phosphatidylcholine, peroxidation is observed after cryopreservation. One of the most toxic COPs- triol was almost absent on sperm lipid extracts. However, exposure to pro-oxidants dramatically increased the total COPs content, but surprisingly did not elevate the concentration of triol. In addition the oxidative challenge increased levels of triol on sperm membrane reconstituted lipid vesicles suggesting that sperm cells may metabolize this toxic COP. Furthermore, COPs may play signaling roles on pathways that drive sperm to capacitation and acrosome reaction, contributing for acquisition of fertilizing ability. Several methodologies that are currently available not only on lipid peroxidation detection but also for protein and DNA oxidation are described in detail in this thesis. It is also shown how determined oxidation conditions influence frozen-thawed fertilizing ability and subsequent embryo development in vitro. Frozen-thawed sperm was exposed prior to IVF during three hours to three different oxidative treatments, (a) 100 µM H2O2; (b) 500 µM H2O2 and (c) 500 µM H2O2 and 20/100 µM Fe2+/Ascorbate. These pro-oxidants are known for their peroxidative properties namely in lipids and DNA. Two control groups were considered, (d) where sperm was equally incubated for 3 h without oxidants and (e) where IVF procedure occurred according to protocol without any previous incubation. The results showed that fertilization took place in all conditions, although incubations (c) showed the lowest cleavage rate compared to all the other groups followed by incubation (b) that had significantly lower cleavage rates than incubations (d) and (e). Embryo development was impaired for condition (c) where a 2-cell block was observed, and condition (b) had lower percentage of Day 9 blastocysts than both control incubations [(d) and (e)]. Flow cytometry analysis showed that DNA oxidation was observed for incubations with highest concentration of oxidants (b) and (c), whereas plasma membrane oxidation was highest from incubation (c). On the other hand percentages of viable and acrosome intact sperm cells were lower only between sperm samples that were incubated for 3 hours and group (e), despite the presence or absence of oxidants. Equally mitochondrial and intracellular oxidations were highest in incubation (c). These results suggest that frozen-thawed sperm can withstand a certain degree of oxidative damage without impairing its acquisition of fertilizing ability (capacitation, acrosome reaction) or impair fertilization itself. And the oocyte plays a very important role in repairing damage that is brought by the sperm upon fertilization and allowing further embryo development.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['About 30 to 50 percent of patients who undergo surgery suffer from nausea or vomiting (PONV) after the operation. These side-effects of anesthesia are unpleasant for patients. Therefore, prevention of PONV is desirable. This may be achieved by selective administration of prophylactic anti-emetics or use of less emetogenic anesthetic agents with patients at high risk of PONV. Such high-risk patients can be identified preoperatively using a prediction model for PONV. Such models predict the risk of PONV based on characteristics such as gender, age, smoking, nausea/vomiting after previous surgery, motion sickness and the type of surgery. Previously, two prediction models for PONV have been developed in Finland and Germany. The research described in this thesis was conducted to test whether these models predict the risk of PONV accurately in other patient groups than the patient groups in which these models were developed (development samples). The predictive accuracy of these models was tested in a group of about 1400 Dutch inpatients who underwent surgery in the Academic Medical Center (AMC) in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. In this group of patients, the predictive accuracy of the models was less than was expected based on the results from the development samples and from previous validation studies. Therefore, a new model was developed using the data from the Dutch validation sample. The predictive accuracy of this new model was subsequently tested in a group of about 1200 inpatients who were operated in the University Medical Center in Utrecht (UMCU). We also tested whether the three available prediction models, developed in inpatients, predict the risk of PONV accurately in outpatients.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Fibroadenoma and phyllodes tumor are fibroepithelial breast tumors. These tumors are biphasic, i.e. they are composed of stroma and epithelium. The behavior of fibroadenomas is benign, whereas phyllodes tumors can recur and even metastasize. Classification criteria for both tumors show considerable overlap, though. Further, morphological observations have suggested that fibroadenoma may progress to phyllodes tumor. The aim of this thesis can be summarized as a study of tumorigenesis and progression in fibroepithelial tumors, i.e. progression in fibroadenomas and progression in grade of phyllodes tumors.\\n\\r\\nBy a comprehensive study of its histology, we identified several regions of phylloid-like stromal progression in fibroadenomas. We subjected these areas to clonality analysis and demonstrated that they are monoclonal. Further, monoclonal epithelial progression to carcinoma in situ was found in fibroadenomas as well. We therefore demonstrated that fibroadenoma may show both epithelial (to carcinoma) and stromal (to phyllodes tumor) progression. The molecular mechanisms underlying development of fibroepithelial tumors are largely unknown. We showed that, in phyllodes tumors, stromal progression is driven by cell cycle deregulation and EGFR overexpression. In addition, stromal p53 expression turned out to be the strongest single prognosticator in phyllodes tumors. In the epithelial component of phyllodes tumors and in fibroadenomas these carcinogenic changes were absent. Deregulation of the cell cycle machinery may lead to loss of genetic integrity. We obtained copy number profiles of fibroepithelial tumors and demonstrated genomic instability in phyllodes tumors, but not in fibroadenomas. Although not related to grade, it seems that genomic instability plays a role in development of phyllodes tumors. Little information is available on the cytokines involved in neovascularization of fibroepithelial tumors. We found that HIF-1α expression, a pivotal angiogenic factor, correlates with tumor grade and predicts prognosis in phyllodes tumors. Surprisingly, phyllodes tumor epithelium showed HIF-1α expression as well, which most likely reflects relatively distant microvasculature causing mild hypoxia. Although similar quantities of microvessels are found in fibroadenomas as compared to phyllodes tumors, HIF-1α does not seem to play a role here. Finally, we compared gene expression profiles of fibroadenomas and phyllodes tumors. We found many novel genes which may contribute to genesis and progression of fibroepithelial tumors. As compared to fibroadenomas, phyllodes tumors showed altered expression of factors involved in transcription, cell adhesion, apoptosis, Wnt signalling, cellular integrity and extracellular matrix degradation. CTAG1, a gene of unknown function, showed a nearly 50-fold upregulation in phyllodes tumors which suggests that it may aid diagnostics.\\n\\r\\nIn this thesis we demonstrated that benign fibroadenoma may progress to the unpredictable phyllodes tumor. Further, we studied several major carcinogenic phenomena and found important roles for cell cycle deregulation, EGFR overexpression, angiogenic factors and genomic instability in phyllodes tumor genesis and progression. Although fibroadenoma and phyllodes tumor share morphological similarities, both tumors are different molecular entities. This thesis contains no data supportive of an active role of the epithelium in fibroepithelial tumors genesis., as had been suggested previously by some authors.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['In this thesis we assessed whether the risk factors known to affect markers of brain damage in the general population, also effectuate brain damage in patients who already have symptomatic arterial disease. \\n\\r\\nWe found that elevated levels of homocysteine were related to slightly lower global cognitive function. The results suggest that vascular mechanisms are not responsible for the relationship between homocysteine and cognitive function. \\n\\r\\nThe relation between the metabolic syndrome or type 2 diabetes mellitus, and cognitive function was investigated. The analyses showed that global cognitive function was not affected more in patients with than in patients without the metabolic syndrome. Only the scores on visuoperception and construction were slightly lower. Adjustment for markers of macro- and microvascular disease, and of metabolic disease, did not attenuate the results. Cognition in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus was similar to cognition in patients with the metabolic syndrome. This suggests that most of the relation between the metabolic syndrome and cognitive function in the general population is attributable to arterial disease. \\n\\r\\nWe analysed the relation between four vascular growth factors and cognitive function. The presence of the communicating arteries in the circle of Willis was assessed, as a measure of presence of cerebral collateral vessels; also the total volume flow rate (tVFR) through both internal carotid arteries and the basilar artery was assessed. In patients with internal carotid artery stenosis, higher basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) levels were related to higher scores on cognitive function. This relation was weakened by adjustment for tVFR, suggesting a mediating effect. Furthermore, patients with higher vascular endothelial growth factor levels had slightly lower performance on visuoperception and construction. We concluded that bFGF seems the most promising of the four studied growth factors for future clinical studies. \\n\\r\\nCognitive function was assessed in three categories of patients with manifest arterial disease: no stroke or TIA, and no silent infarcts; silent infarcts; or stroke or TIA at inclusion. While silent infarcts did not influence cognitive function in these patients, patients with stroke or TIA had lower scores than patients with symptoms elsewhere in the arterial tree. Thus, when patients already are vascular compromised, the presence of a silent brain infarct does not add to the cognitive dysfunction due to the arterial disease itself, while symptomatic cerebrovascular disease does affect cognitive function more severely.\\n\\r\\nPatients with manifest arterial disease did not have lower flow to the brain compared with the general population. Presence of diabetes mellitus was associated with lower total volume flow rate, as was increasing BMI. Patients with cerebrovascular disease had lower tVFR values than patients with symptomatic vascular disease elsewhere in the vascular tree. \\n\\r\\nWe have reviewed the literature on the fetal type posterior (FTP) circle of Willis. In FTPs there is an embryonic derivation of the posterior cerebral artery from the internal carotid artery. Besides the fact that a larger area is thus dependent on the internal carotid artery, leptomeningeal vessels can not develop between the anterior and posterior circulation. \\n\\r\\nPatients with a bFTP circle of Willis did not have statistically significant different WML volumes than patients without an FTP in our study. These preliminary results will be followed by extended analyses in patients with a unilateral FTP and comparison of different techniques to assess WML.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Recombinant gene delivery vehicles based on the replication-defective AAV have gained a preeminent position in the field of gene delivery to the brain. Efficient global gene delivery to the CNS is beneficial for the study of gene products is the entire CNS as well as for introducing and expressing genes encoding potential therapeutic or protective proteins in neuronal tissue. Although efficient global gene delivery to the CNS is an ambitious goal, recent scientific developments, as for instance the expansion of the repertoire of AAV vectors by the isolation of new serotypes and the creation of AAV vectors with chimeric capsids, might open up new avenues to achieve this goal. The overall aim of this thesis was to achieve efficient, scientifically and therapeutically relevant AAV- mediated gene delivery to the mouse brain. First, experiments were performed to assess the ability of different serotype AAV vectors to achieve efficient gene delivery to the CNS upon neonatal ICV injection. AAV8 was able to achieve most efficient, widespread delivery of transgenes. Second, the transduction properties of novel mosaic vectors incorporating capsid proteins from AAV1, AAV2, and AAV8 capsids are described. The transduction profiles of these vectors were compared to those of parental serotypes in mouse primary cortical cultures and in vivo after injection into the cerebral lateral ventricles of neonatal mice. Both in culture and in vivo, these mosaic vectors displayed additional properties. Third, the properties of both parental serotype vectors and mosaic vectors were assessed upon injection into the striatum of adult mice. The lysosomal storage disease GM1-gangliosidosis, an autosomal recessive deficiency of lysosomal acid β-galactosidase is biochemically characterized by accumulation of GM1-ganglioside in the central nervous system (CNS), and partially degraded glycoproteins, keratan sulfate and oligosaccharides in visceral organs. GM1-gangliosidosis is a proper candidate for gene therapy, as not all cells in the central nervous system have to be genetically modified to achieve therapeutic efficacy, because mechanisms for efficient secretion and uptake of lysosomal enzymes exist. Next, experiments were conducted to characterize the distribution of lysosomal β-galactosidase in the adult GM1-gangliosidosis mouse brain after AAV-mediated gene delivery. Several mechanisms of distribution were observed including: diffusion, axonal transport of the enzyme and axonal transport of mRNA. To evaluate the therapeutic potential of AAV- mediated gene delivery in neonatal GM1-gangliosidosis mice, an AAV vector encoding for β-galactosidase was injected into the cerebroventricles of neonatal GM1-gangliosidosis mice. which resulted in complete correction of enzymatic deficiency and lysosomal storage throughout the GM1-gangliosidosis mouse forebrain. Based on the results described in this thesis, AAV vectors can be considered highly promising vehicles for the delivery of therapeutically relevant transgenes to the CNS.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Peptides and proteins play a pivotal role in numerous life-processes and may show important pharmacological activities. There is an increasing interest in using these biomolecules for new therapies to treat life-threatening diseases. As a consequence, in the life sciences there is a great need for analytical techniques that allow reliable identification, characterization and quantification of peptides and proteins. Capillary electrophoresis (CE) is a powerful analytical technique that is well-suited for the analysis of biomolecules. CE offers much higher separation efficiencies than commonly used methods for peptides and proteins, such as HPLC and SDS-PAGE. Furthermore, it is relatively fast, and analyses can be performed under near-physiological and nondenaturing conditions. However, adsorption of peptides and proteins at the inner surface of fused-silica capillaries can result in poor separation efficiencies and irreproducible results. In the past, various methods have been proposed to circumvent this problem, but often these were laborious and showed limited applicability. Here we present a new elegant method that employs charged polymers to create a molecular bilayer on the capillary inner wall that prevents adsorption of biomolecular compounds. The coating procedure is straightforward and fast comprising only a simple flush of the capillary with aqueous solutions of the charged polymers. This thesis evaluates the suitability of capillaries coated with a bilayer of the polymers polybrene (PB) and poly(vinyl sulfonate) (PVS) for the analysis of peptides and proteins by CE with UV and MS detection. The electroosmotic flow induced by the coating was strong and constant, and independent of the type and pH of the BGE. The coating was stable providing reproducible migration-times for peptides and proteins (RSDs < 1.0%). The use of BGEs of high ionic strength effectively minimized interaction between analytes and the capillary wall, yielding plate numbers up to 600,000 for peptides and up to 300,000 for proteins. The bilayer coating demonstrated to be fully compatible with MS detection: no ion suppression or background signals of coating agents on mass spectra of the analytes were observed. Overall, these characteristics provide a CE system that is highly suitable for the fast, efficient and reproducible profiling of complex peptide and protein mixtures. The usefulness and resolving power of the new analytical system is demonstrated by the analyses of isomeric peptide/peptoid mixtures, closely-related peptides (enkephalins), and protein digests (revealing up to 20 peptides in a 1-min time interval). Furthermore, the bilayer-coated capillaries showed to be very useful for the stability monitoring and characterization of (degraded) biopharmaceuticals. These results indicate a performance that can be of great value in relevant fields such as proteomics, peptidomics, metabolomics, protein characterization, and quality control of protein pharmaceuticals preparations. In all these application areas, revealing differences among samples is an important issue, and requires the possibility to reliably acquire and compare separation profiles.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The development of new anticancer drugs can be divided into six phases: characterization of the API (structural and analytical), solubility- and stability studies, design of the formulation, manufacturing, quality control analysis, and (bio)compatibility studies. Structural and analytical characterization of the API is required before solubility- and stability studies are performed. Subsequently, solubility- and stability studies are performed. Because anticancer drugs are mainly compounds with a decreased solubility in aqueous solutions, formulations have to be developed which increase the solubility of the API. This thesis showed that the use of the organic solvent tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) in combination with freeze drying is a suited technique to elucidate both solubility- and stability problems. Furthermore, it was found with DSC analysis that during freeze drying of 40% v/v TBA three different crystals are formed: TBA hydrate (containing 70% w/w TBA)-ice crystals, pure TBA hydrate crystals (containing 70% w/w TBA), and TBA hydrate crystals containing 90-95% w/w TBA. Furthermore, it was seen that crystallization of TBA was inhibited when both mannitol and sodium bicarbonate were present. Another technique to solve dissolution problems is the use of complexing agents. In this thesis the use of the complexation agent 2-hydroxypropyl-?-cyclodextrin (HP?CD) is described. It was shown that this agent can be very useful for complexation of drugs even if the complexation constant is relatively low. Furthermore, it was seen that the addition of HP?CD can result in different stability profiles, indicating that the presence of excipients can influence the stability profile dramatically. Based on the results of the solubility- and stability studies the final formulation is developed. Subsequently, further research is performed to be able to guarantee a formulated product of good quality. Therefore, compatibility studies have to be performed to determine the stability of the product in the primary packaging material, in the clinic (after dilution prior to administration) and in the physiological environment (i.e. simulation of the “in vivo” situation). Meanwhile, specification limits of the newly developed final product have to be defined. After these studies a final formulation is selected and manufacturing is performed on small scale for phase I and II clinical trials. However, before this is performed, possible interactions between the drug substance and/or excipients with the manufacturing materials should be investigated (e.g. extraction of lipophile compounds from silicone tubing by complexing agents). Furthermore, because only a limited amount of batches is manufactured in this stage of development, it is not possible to perform risk assessment of the manufacturing process per product. Therefore, we performed risk assessment using mixed effects analysis. This method was shown to be a suitable technique for risk assessment in this early stage of development. Overall it can be concluded that all the items discussed in this thesis are of importance during pharmaceutical development experimental agents to obtain a final pharmaceutical product of good quality. Neglecting one step may result in an undesired decrease in product quality.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Schizophrenia is a complex psychiatric illness which is caused by multiple genes and gene-environment interactions. This complex etiology has a negative impact on the power of molecular genetic studies. To improve this situation, attempts are made to define traits that are more intimately related to the genetic factors of schizophrenia, and have a more straightforward genotype-phenotype relationship. These traits are called endophenotypes. The deficit of patients to suppress reflexive saccades during antisaccades has been suggested as endophenotype for schizophrenia. Recent evidence suggests that functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)-brain activation maps can further strengthen the genotype-phenotype relationship. In a series of studies, the suitability of brain activation maps during antisaccades as endophenotype for schizophrenia is assessed. In the first study, an event related fMRI design was developed for measuring the brain activation associated with saccades and saccadic inhibition. This study demonstrated that fMRI could pick up brain activation in all areas that are known to be involved in oculomotor functioning from studies in primates. In addition, the results of this study stress the importance of using event related fMRI for this particular saccade paradigm. An endophenotype should be related to the illness. In the second study, the fMRI design was used to find the functional brain abnormalities that underlie the saccadic inhibition deficit in schizophrenia. It was found that patients did not activate the striatum during inhibition of saccades. These results indicate that the impairment of patients in saccadic inhibition can be related to a dysfunction in the striatum, or in the frontostriatal circuitry. An endophenotype is more frequently present in those with genetic risk for schizophrenia. Accordingly, the third study found the same striatal abnormality in healthy siblings of patients during antisaccades. However, the siblings did not demonstrate an behavioural abnormality, suggesting that fMRI activation maps can increase sensitivity. When subjects are phenotyped based on brain activation, age differences between subjects can ad noise to the data. In the fourth study, effects of aging on brain activation during the antisaccade paradigm were assessed in a group covering a broad age range. Age did not only alter the cognitive strategy for the task, but also the neuronal vascular coupling. Good endophenotypes should be stable traits. The fifth study assessed the reproducibility of brain activation during antisaccades over a one week period in a group of healthy subjects. The results demonstrated large differences between subjects in the test-retest reliability of brain activation maps, which was caused largely by stable differences between subjects in signal to noise ratios. Differences between subjects in signal to noise can result in overestimation of between subject variance. In conclusion, fMRI is capable of detecting saccade related brain activation and abnormalities in patients and their siblings, even when no behavioural abnormalities could be detected. Hence the use of fMRI could potentially strengthen the genotype-phenotype relationship. Although fMRI is not yet capable of to obtain reliable activation maps in all subjects, this situation is likely to improve in the future with increasing MR-field strengths and more sophisticated acquisition techniques.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Major depression is a prevalent disease among the elderly, significantly decreasing the quality of life. The age of first onset of depression can be early in life, so called early-onset depression (EOD), as well as first occur in old age, i.e. late-onset depression (LOD). Some previous studies have suggested aetiological differences between EOD and LOD in the elderly. However, the number of these studies investigating elderly EOD and LOD patients is small. Therefore the importance of age of onset in the aetiology of late-life depression remains unclear. We used Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to examine hippocampal volume and subcortical white matter lesions in elderly patients with EOD and LOD and healthy elderly subjects. Both the hippocampus and subcortical white matter lesions have been implicated in the aetiology and treatment outcome of late-life depression. Hippocampal volume decrease and increased prevalence of subcortical white matter lesions in depressed patients might point to underlying disease pathology and have been related to the outcome of antidepressive treatment. In addition, different brain changes in elderly patients with EOD and LOD may suggest different neural underlying mechanisms. First we tested whether late-life depression was associated with structural brain abnormalities. We compared elderly patients with late-life depression and age-matched healthy elderly and found the volume of the hippocampus to be decreased in the patients. Secondly, we examined if this hippocampal volume decrease was general or specific for EOD or LOD by comparing hippocampal volume and white matter lesions in EOD, LOD, and healthy subjects. We found hippocampal volume to be decreased only in EOD patients. White matter lesions were increased only in LOD subjects. Finally, the presence of white matter lesions was not related to the decrease in hippocampal volume. The hippocampus is an important neural structure in the aetiology of late-life depression. Previous research has suggested that multiple, chronic depressive episodes lead to hippocampal damage. Our finding fitted with this observation. Hippocampal volume decrease was observed in late-life depressed patients, particularly in those with a long history of depressive symptomatology. Previous research implies that the neurotoxic effects on the hippocampus by glucocorticoids, known to be overtly released during depressive episodes, explain the hippocampal volume decrease in major depression. Subcortical white matter lesions were more present in LOD patients. These lesions are due to vascular pathology. Therefore, the increased presence of white matter lesions may suggest vascular pathology to play an important role in the aetiology of LOD. We conclude from these findings that different neural mechanisms play a role in late-life depression and that age of onset may be a valuable marker of these mechanisms. We also wanted to know whether the structural brain abnormalities influence the outcome of short-term antidepressive treatment. We therefore compared structural brain abnormalities of responders and non-responders to short-term antidepressant therapy. We did not find any differences in structural brain abnormalities between responders and non-responders. This could suggest that for short-term therapy, treatment protocols should not be modified due to the presence of structural brain abnormalities.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The thesis covers a field outbreak investigation into the cause and pathogenesis of \"illthrift\" on a dairy farm that was due to vanadium exposure, it examines methods of treating vanadium poisoning in cattle using an experimental study, looks at the use of cattle as sentinels for detecting and monitoring vanadium pollution, and examines the public health implications of cattle being farmed in areas of high background vanadium levels. \\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe outbreak investigation found that vanadium poisoning manifested in animals 4 to 18 months old, which showed emaciation, chronic diarrhoea, and in some cases, rhinitis, conjunctivitis and recumbency followed by death. Post-mortem and clinical pathology findings indicated that malabsorption and immunosuppression were the basis of the pathogenesis in affected animals. \\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIn the experimental study, CaNa2EDTA appeared to enhance the excretion of vanadium in calves, but there was no proof that the treatment had a protective effect against vanadium exposure. \\r\\n\\n\\r\\nDuring the sentinel study a stochastic exposure model was developed. The exposure model differs from most other approaches in several ways: 1.It does not rely heavily on extrapolating information from the point source to the point of exposure. 2. It incorporates the physiological constraints of the species exposed. 3. It takes into account oral as well as inhalation exposure and thus can account for intake from contaminated grazing, vegetables and crops grown in the area of pollution. 4. It addresses the common weaknesses in many models of insensitivity to terrain, by using measurements at the point of exposure. 5. It accounts for existing background concentrations of pollutants and pollutants from multiple sources and 6. the stochastic process and use of distribution functions accounts for variability in the data over time, which is usually a problem with long term studies.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHaving developed and validated the exposure model, an exposure dose was then modelled for different periods that animals were exposed for and this dose was then correlated to a wide range of biomarker responses that were monitored during the trial. In live animals, a difference in response was found between the high exposure group and low exposure group with respect to serum albumin, monocyte and thrombocyte counts, and hair and faeces vanadium concentrations. No difference in vanadium concentrations could be shown for urine, the traditional occupational health biomarker. None of the other potential biomarkers examined proved to be of much value in determining or predicting vanadium exposure in Bos indicus cattle. Regression models are described for serum albumin, monocyte counts, faeces and hair, which showed the most promise as biomarkers.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAverage concentrations of vanadium in the tissues of slaughtered cattle ranged from 0.08 to 2.94 mg/kg. Significant correlations were found between the exposure dose just prior to slaughter and the concentrations of vanadium in the coccygeal vertebrae, liver, diaphragm and rib-bone in descending order of magnitude. Other tissues showed poor correlation to the end-dose. \\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe study also evaluated the public health risks of consuming meat and milk from cattle originating from areas high in vanadium. Using a stochastic model and lognormal distribution function to look at possible extreme tissue residue values that are likely to occur, it was concluded from current knowledge of toxicity in humans that the tissue and milk residues of vanadium from cattle should pose no health risk to the consumer. \\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe sentinel study proved that cattle could be used in a mining environment to monitor health risks to both cattle and humans, as a risk communication tool for interested parties and as a way of studying the chronic effects of pollutants.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The ultimate goal of this research was to find central biomarkers of satiety, i.e., physiological measures in the brain that relate to subjectively rated appetite, actual food intake, or both. This thesis describes the changes in brain activity in response to food stimuli as measured by functional MRI, with a focus on the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus is a brain area of particular interest because of its central role in the regulation of food intake. Two earlier studies showed that one long fMRI-scan can be used to measure fMRI signal changes in the hypothalamus in response to the ingestion of a glucose solution. In effect, these studies provided an experimental design suited for the measurement of temporal changes in hypothalamic activity following a single treatment. We aimed to evaluate the use of such fMRI measurements of the hypothalamus as a biomarker of metabolic satiety. First, we showed a prolonged and, importantly, dose-dependent decrease in the hypothalamic fMRI signal within few minutes after the ingestion of a glucose solution. Next, this signal decrease proved to be specific to glucose ingestion in so far that no signal decreases were observed in the hypothalamus after ingestion of a non-sweet carbohydrate (maltodextrin solution) and a sweet-tasting solution (aspartame). Compared to ingestion of glucose, the hypothalamic response after infusion of glucose into the bloodstream was smaller and less prolonged. The blood insulin response to ingestion of glucose was also more prolonged than that to infusion of glucose, and was associated with better glucoregulation. Also, correlations were found between the total fMRI response after glucose infusion and the fasting blood insulin concentration and between the total fMRI response after glucose ingestion and subjective ratings of hunger. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, ingestion of glucose was not associated with a decrease in the hypothalamic fMRI signal as it was in healthy control subjects. In one study, the focus was on sensory-specific rather than metabolic satiety effects. The results showed sex differences in the effect of satiation with chocolate on the brain activity associated with tasting chocolate milk in the hypothalamus, ventral striatum and medial prefrontal cortex. In conclusion, the hypothalamic fMRI response to glucose is a reproducible dose-dependent measure. So far, it has proven to be specific to glucose. Its correlation with subjective ratings of hunger after glucose ingestion makes it an interesting candidate-biomarker of metabolic satiety. It is also affected by preabsorptive signals, the fasting blood insulin concentration and pathology (type 2 diabetes mellitus). Taken together, the research in this thesis provides the first steps to much more functional neuroimaging research into the effects of food stimuli on the hypothalamus and the rest of the brain. In general, functional MRI provides valuable and promising tools for investigating the regulation of food intake in the brain. The search for biomarkers of satiety, whether successful or not, provides a better understanding of the physiological mechanisms behind the regulation of food intake and energy balance. Such knowledge can help in preventing and curing obesity.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Alkaline phosphatases are dimeric, membrane-bound ectoenzymes and can be found in many tissues throughout the body where they serve various physiological functions. In mammals, four isoforms can be distinguished, including placental (PLAP), germ cell (GCAP), intestinal (IAP) and the bone-liver-kidney (BLK) isotypes. In 1997 it was shown that human placental alkaline phosphatase (HPLAP) dephosphorylates and thereby detoxifies LPS at physiological pH levels. LPS is a constituent of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and is responsible for much of the clinical symptoms associated with Gram-negative sepsis. Despite all innovations in the technical management of critically ill patients and the efforts made in developing and exploring new therapies, sepsis still continues to be one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity in hospitals with mortality rates of 35-50%. Many therapies against this LPS-mediated disease aimed at neutralizing or antagonizing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and mediators or LPS itself. However, none of these trials have been proven effective. This thesis describes pre-clinical and clinical studies that were initiated in order to investigate if bovine calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (BIAP) can be developed as a novel therapeutic agent in the treatment of Gram-negative sepsis and other LPS-mediated diseases. The main goal of the initial studies was to provide Proof of Principle data on the efficacy of BIAP. The observation that BIAP significantly reduced mortality in mice that had received a lethal doses of E.coli bacteria warranted for further study in a LPS model. For this purpose, piglets were administered LPS with or without BIAP. The results of this study show that BIAP attenuated TNF? levels up to 80%. In addition, changes in hematological parameters were antagonized. In vitro, using macrophages and epithelial cells, BIAP reduced the production of cytokines and nitric oxide after LPS stimulation. The above mentioned results indicate that BIAP may be beneficial in Gram-negative sepsis. However, before BIAP can be applied as therapeutic, safety and tolerability of its administration had to be investigated. For this purpose, single as well as multiple-dosing studies were performed in different animal species as well as humans. The results show that BIAP administration resulted in big differences in immune reactivity towards the protein. Single dosing of BIAP was safe and also multiple dosing of BIAP to dogs and piglets did not result in any adverse effect. However, mice that received multiple doses of BIAP reacted with antibody production and serum sickness. These reactions could be prevented by pretreatment of mice with BIAP in their drinking water. Besides studying safety and tolerability, the pharmacokinetic profile of BIAP was investigated. BIAP clerarance showed to be dose-independent and biphasic with a fast initial distribution phase, followed by a much slower clearance. In conclusion, based on efficacy of the protein as well as safety and tolerability after its administration, BIAP potentially encompasses a novel therapeutic drug in the treatment of LPS-mediated diseases. Results of a clinical phase II in sepsis patients, which is currently ongoing, will learn us if BIAP is indeed beneficial in Gram-negative sepsis.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The genome is constantly challenged by factors that can induce DNA damage and thereby threaten the viability of the cell. If DNA damage remains unrepaired it can lead to the development of cancer. Although much is known about the role of proteins and protein complexes in the cellular response to DNA damage, an overview of events occurring at the protein level upon DSB induction has never been reported. Here proteomics was used to bring this about. Mapping of cellular events at the proteome level requires methods that allow accurate and reproducible quantitation of protein expression levels in complex biological systems. We compared a 2D gel-based quantitation method, two-dimensional difference in-gel electrophoresis (2D-DiGE), to metabolic stable isotope labelling, one of the most accurate methods. This showed that both methods provide comparable results with excellent correlation. Subsequently, 2D-DiGE was applied to the investigation of effects of bleomycin-induced DNA damage on the nuclear proteome of human lymphoblastoid cell lines. Interestingly, the nuclear levels of three proteins, known to form the inhibitor of acetyltransferase (INHAT) complex involved in transcriptional regulation, were found to decrease rapidly upon DNA DSB induction, suggesting a role for the INHAT complex in chromatin remodelling events that precede DNA repair. Some of the cell lines used in our study show a hypersensitive phenotype, which means they are hypersensitive towards DNA damage induction and the individuals from which they were retrieved have an increased risk to develop cancer. Since the underlying mechanisms for this decreased genome stability are unknown, we attempted to gain insight into the way these cells cope with DNA damage. This revealed differences in nuclear protein levels between the normal and the hypersensitive cell lines and suggested that differences in regulation of chromatin structure can also influence cellular sensitivity towards DNA damage induction. In the tight regulation of the response to DNA damage, protein phosphorylation plays a crucial role. To study this, a method was developed for the specific enrichment of serine- and threonine-phosphorylated peptides, which is based on the base-catalysed b-elimination of phosphate from a serine- or threonine-phosphorylated peptide. The method allowed selective enrichment of a phosphorylated peptide from a peptide mixture. Additionally, DNA damage-induced changes in the sub-proteome of histone-binding proteins were studied. Despite the growing interest in the role of chromatin remodelling in the DNA damage response, not much is known about the exact mechanisms through which these processes are regulated. Our study reveals that phosphorylation plays an important role in activation of histone chaperones that take part in multiple remodelling complexes. Our results provide insight into some complex features of protein networks at the cross roads of nucleosome assembly, DNA transcription and repair. Taken together, the work described in this thesis highlights the strength of proteomics when analysing complex cellular mechanisms, like the DNA damage response and it emphasizes the importance of protein post-translational modifications and relocalization in the regulation of cellular events.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Research on both higher and lower eukaryotic model systems have revealed that numerous aspects are involved in the course of the aging process. Although strides have been made to understand the role of these processes in the development of aging, a general consensus has not been reached on the relative importance of each of them. Mapping the changes that occur in the course of the aging process, and thereby define so called markers of aging, could provide the information necessary to understand the aging process and the contributions of the different mechanisms herein. Changes that occur during aging, such as increased cellular death and decreased tissue and organ functioning, could be reflected in the blood plasma protein composition. However, proteomic analysis of plasma is hampered by the presence of several highly abundant bulk proteins. In chapter 2 of this thesis, the selection of highly specific single domain Llama antibody fragments (VHH) for affinity chromatography purposes is described, which can be used to remove the highly abundant human plasma proteins, human serum albumin (HSA) and all subclasses of immunoglobulin G (IgG). This removal resulted in the visualization of previously masked protein spots and an increased visibility of previously non-detectable protein spots on 2D-gel. In chapter 3, the use of these affinity ligands, combined with two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE), is shown in a human blood plasma proteomics study to reveal protein expression differences between young and old individuals. This revealed the importance of studying levels of protein isoforms next to total protein expression levels. Furthermore, this approach demonstrated that upon aging a slightly increased pro-coagulant and pro-inflammatory state is induced. The increase of oxidative stress observed during aging can damage various different cellular molecules. An organelle that seems especially vulnerable for oxidative stress is the ER. Increased oxidative stress might interfere with protein folding and lead to differences in expression of the proteins involved in proper protein folding in the ER. These proteins contain a C-terminal KDEL signal sequence, which determines their ER localization. In chapter 4, the selection and application of VHHs specific for the C-terminal KDEL sequence is described that can be used to study protein expression patterns in cellular ER stress models. In chapter 5 the application of the KDEL specific VHH provides preliminary data on the changed expression of several ER resident proteins in a HUVEC senescence model comparing young and senescent cells. Intriguingly, clear changes are observed. However, these changes do not resemble the expression differences observed during severe ER stress. Furthermore, the expression of the membrane protein endoglin, which is involved in cellular proliferation, is decreased upon replicative senescence. These data clearly show that during replicative senescence changes occur at the protein level that could influence cellular and consequently tissue functionality, which could provide an environment for the development of age-associated diseases like atherosclerosis.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Pneumoproteins in interstitial lung diseases'],\n",
       "  'Description': [\"The interstitial lung diseases (ILD)s are a diverse group of pulmonary disorders that are classified together because of similar clinical, roentgenographic, physiologic, or pathologic manifestations, compromising over 100 different members that have been broadly classified into several categories. The major abnormality in ILDs is disruption of the lung parenchyma. Sarcoidosis is the commonest ILD in the western world. In our own experience, hypersensitivity pneumonitis is also quite common in the Utrecht region. The lung epithelial cells produce surfactant, mucus and several lung-epithelium-specific proteins. These lung-epithelium-specific proteins can be classified in three separate groups: the mucins, CC10, and the surfactant proteins. Some proteins that are secreted by pulmonary cells are not only present at the surface of the respiratory tract, but are also detectable in the blood. Hermans and Bernard introduced the term pneumoproteins for these markers. Because these proteins are produced in the lungs, their presence in serum can only be explained by leakage through the alveolar-capillary membrane into the vascular compartment. Biomarkers can be used to diagnose a disease, to monitor disease activity, to assess disease severity, and to predict the course of a disease. We studied these four qualities of pneumoproteins in the two most prevalent ILDs at our department (sarcoidosis and hypersensitivity pneumonitis). Although KL-6 and SP-D can help to differentiate bacterial pneumonia from ILD, pneumoproteins have little diagnostic value since these proteins are elevated in various ILDs, and, therefore, lack specificity. Pneumoproteins are for example unable to differentiate sarcoidosis from hypersensitivity pneumonitis. However, as demonstrated in this thesis, pneumoproteins can be useful to monitor ILD activity and assess disease severity. Although CC10, KL-6 and SP-D had been studied separately in sarcoidosis, we were the first to perform a comparative analysis. In sarcoidosis, CC10 and KL-6 reflected disease severity, since they both correlated with radiologic stage and pulmonary function impairment. SP-D did not seem to be useful as serum marker in sarcoidosis. In bird fanciers' lung (hypersensitivity pneumonitis), KL-6 and SP-D correlated with disease activity. Some genetic polymorphisms influence regulatory mechanisms and cause interindividual differences in protein production. A correlation between serum CC10 and SP-D, and their encoding genes had already been described. We confirmed the CC10 gene-protein association in a Dutch Caucasian population of healthy controls and sarcoidosis patients. Previous studies found a similar association for CC10 in Japanese sarcoidosis patients, and Australian asthmatic children. Furthermore, we were the first to demonstrate that serum KL-6 levels are influenced by a mucin 1 gene polymorphism, and we calculated genotype-specific reference intervals. We conclude that serum pneumoproteins are useful biomarkers for the monitoring of ILD patients. Using genotype-specific reference intervals might improve their clinical value.\"],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Training induced adaptation in horse skeletal muscle'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['It appears that the physiological and biochemical adaptation of skeletal muscle to training in equine species shows a lot of similarities with human and rodent physiological adaptation. On the other hand it is becoming increasingly clear that intra-cellular mechanisms of adaptation (substrate transport, enzyme activity, etc) differ considerably between species. The major drawbacks in equine training physiological research are the lack of an appropriate training model and the lack of control of sensitivity and specificity of parameters used in human and rodent research. Furthermore, scientists become aware of the fact that the coupling of biochemical properties of skeletal muscle and other physiological systems play a role in the whole body adaptation during training adaptation. The present thesis focuses on development of a scientific based controlled equine training model, based on equine training practice, and the adaptation in equine skeletal muscle physiological, biochemical, and neuromuscular pathways. During rest and exercise, glucose and triglycerides provide the most energy needed. Both substrates are stored in skeletal muscle, glucose as glycogen and triglycerides as lipid droplets. Transport of these substrates into skeletal muscle is primarily regulated by glucose transporter 4 (GLUT-4) and fatty acid translocase (FAT/CD36). In this thesis we show that the immunohistochemical distribution of these proteins is similar to human expression patterns. Accumulation of lactic acid during exercise is a major determinant of fatigue. Lactic acid is removed from the cell by specific membrane transport proteins, monocarboxylate transporters (MCT). These MCT proteins promote transport of lactate anions and protons from production sites (anaerobic metabolism, mainly in fast glycolytic muscle fibres) to oxidation sites (heart, brain and oxidative muscle fibres). This thesis identifies the expression of MCT1, 2 and 4 in Standardbred skeletal muscle. The training protocol used in this study resulted in changes in quantitative electromygraphic (EMG) values associated with training. Biochemical analysis of skeletal muscle biopsies resulted in less pronounced training adaptation than quantitative EMG. Quantitative EMG and biochemical analysis both showed no signs of mal-adaptation after intensified training compared to controls. There was however a stronger training associated adaptation observed upon intensified training. Finally, we applied these techniques to horses suffering from lower motor neuron disease (LMND), among others a model for denervation. This disease is characterized by increased whole body glucose metabolism and muscular atrophy and weight loss, due to degeneration of motor neurons in the spinal cord. Using these techniques we show that increased whole body glucose uptake is not accompanied by increased GLUT-4 expression. Furthermore we conclude that metabolic changes are secondary to denervation and reinnervation processes in this disease. The main conclusion from our results is that the intensified training protocol used in this study does not increases stress levels above the maximal threshold for skeletal muscle (mal)adaptation. Sarcolemmal substrate transport proteins for fatty acids (FAT/CD36), glucose (GLUT-4) and monocarboxylates (MCT), as identified in this thesis, may have an important function in (mal)adaptation of skeletal muscle metabolism to training and intensified training. Due to technical problems, we were unfortunately not able to perform these analysis.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The concept of refinement is one of the major issues in the field of laboratory animal science and aims at reducing the incidence and severity of painful, distressing or discomforting procedures applied to laboratory animals. In this thesis, it was argued that the term refinement should be extended beyond its original meaning: besides the aim to minimise pain and discomfort, refinement should also entail the effort of experimenters to obtain the best possible results from their animal experiments or, in other words, to acquire reliable and valid data. Laboratory animals are subjected to many procedures which are part of daily routine. The studies presented in this thesis were performed to gain a further insight into the acute physiological stress response in laboratory mice (Mus musculus) caused by such routine experimental procedures. These acute stress responses should be taken into account when collecting data, as they may well influence results. It was investigated whether (i) environmental factors, which are generally believed to have a significant influence on the outcome of experiments, influenced this acute stress response and had the potential to diminish it; and (ii) how this could be assessed by the use of physiological parameters like heart rate (HR) and body temperature (BT) as measured by radio-telemetry. The studies were designed to mimic common laboratory situations and/or to be easily applicable in laboratory settings. After a first experiment had confirmed the applicability of HR and BT as quantitative parameters of acute stress, by comparing them with the validated stress hormone corticosterone (CORT), the following series of experiments established that certain environmental factors did indeed influence this acute stress response, whereas others showed no or little effect. Individual housing, cage enrichment and the announcement of restraint followed by reward were found to have a significant impact on HR and BT after routine procedures such as restraint by hand or injections, but the experimenter performing the routine procedure, the daily handling regime, the effect of reward following restraint without a preceding cue or the presence of rats in the mouse room were not found to show a detectable influence. The results did not indicate habituation of the mice to the routine procedures, but neither long-term effects of the procedures could be found. The acute stress responses all seemed to fall within the adaptive abilities of the mice, and the routine procedures performed in this thesis are therefore not considered to cause lasting harm, and as such are no major challenge to the well-being of the mice. However, the results of the current studies have illustrated the relevance of further research to evaluate the effects of routine procedures and the impact of environmental factors. For now, it can be stated that basal values of HR, BT or CORT should not be assessed directly after the animals have been subjected to routine procedures, and a recovery period of at least one to two hours is recommended.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Breast Arterial Calcifications and Heart Disease Risk in women'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Imaging of vascular calcification is increasingly used for cardiovascular screening purposes in asymptomatic patients. Coronary and aortic calcium deposits in the vascular wall have been shown to be related to atherosclerotic plaque burden. New imaging techniques with electron beam computed tomography (EBCT) and multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT), to measure the calcium content in the coronary arteries, are promising methods for clinical risk assessment. However, the rising costs of these emerging cardiac imaging techniques and the radiation exposure involved demand a more critical evaluation of already existing and less expensive technology. In this thesis we have investigated whether arterial calcifications that are frequently seen on mammograms may serve as a screening tool for atherosclerotic risk assessment in women. The simultaneous use of mammograms for screening on breast cancer and atherosclerotic disease could be very cost-effective. Based on our findings in two different populations of women we can now conclude that the major determinants of medial calcification in the breast arteries are age, diabetes, previous pregnancies and lactation after pregnancy. The mechanisms of BAC are comparable to the medial calcification that is seen in the peripheral vessels of diabetics and in patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD). In diabetics, hyperglycaemia is an important determinant for medial sclerosis and not the classic CHD risk factors. High glucose can induce proliferation of VSMC into calcifying cells, but other metabolic stimuli in patients with diabetes, like hyperinsulinemia and glycoxidation products, can also promote the calcifying process. In patients with ESRD the uptake of calcium by VSMC is multifactorial and enhanced by elevated extracellular calcium- and phosphate levels, secondary hyperparathyreoidism and uremic toxins. The wide-spread use of calcium containing oral phosphate binders, to prevent uremic dystrophy, further promote the calcifying process. The alterated mineral metabolism during pregnancy and lactation is presumably the most important causative factor in the occurrence of BAC. Pregnancy is associated with major changes in the calcium metabolism to meet the high requirements for foetal growth and for breast-milk production. Some biochemical proteins of bone resorption and formation (e.g. osteocalcin, bone morphogenic protein) are elevated in the first months of lactation and are also found in calcified vascular tissues. We assume that when calcium is more available in the (breast) circulation, like during pregnancy and lactation, vascular smooth muscle cells can become activated and promote mineralization. Another common factor in the enhancement of vascular calcification in pregnant women and patients with ESRD may be caused by elevated levels of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP). PTHrP is expressed in a variety of bone and vascular tissues and causes hypercalcaemia. The production of PTHrP by the lactating mammary gland may be an explanation for the association of BAC with breastfeeding.'],\n",

       "  'Description': [\"Infections with group A streptococci (GAS), or S. pyogenes, range from mild and superficial to very severe and lethal invasive disease. In severe invasive GAS infections, hypotension and multiorgan failure may develop rapidly resulting in the development of toxic shock-like syndrome (TSS). In the northern part of the world's Western Hemisphere, a high endemic level of GAS infection in the 19th century was followed by a spontaneous decline. Nonetheless, a resurgence of fulminant invasive GAS infections was noted in the late-1980s. Because of the unexpected resurgence of this dramatic bacterial disease, a prospective population-based national surveillance program on invasive GAS disease was initiated in The Netherlands in1992. The aim of this thesis was to gain understanding in the epidemiology of invasive GAS infections in the Netherlands and to investigate the relationship between the genetic composition of the bacterium and its clinical and epidemiological manifestations. From 1992 through 1996, a total of 880 patients with invasive streptococcal disease were clinically evaluated. Based on antigenic differences in their M-protein, GAS can be further subdivided. Predominant M-types were M1 (21%), M3 (11%), M6 (5%), M12 (5%), and M28 (8%). The case-fatality rate was 18% overall, but it reached 59% among cases of TSS. Older age, necrotizing fasciitis, sepsis without focus, pneumonia, infection with type M1 or M3 strains, and underlying cardiopulmonary disease were associated with fatality. For long term GAS disease surveillance, invasive isolates were obtained from 1504 patients from May 1994 until December 2003. There was a clear seasonal pattern in invasive streptococcal infections, with an estimated annual incidence that peaked in 1996 (4.0 cases / 100 000 individuals / year) and was at its lowest in 1999 (2.0 cases / 100 000 individuals / year). Since GAS virulence appears to be determined by a complex interplay between multiple virulence factors rather than a limited number of genes only, we constructed a mixed-genome microarray. Microarray analysis revealed that inter M-type differences clearly outweighed intra M-type differences on a whole genomic level. Genetic variation between and within M-types was largely attributable to phages or phage-like elements. Using the mixed-genome microarray technique we could identify biomarkers that were uniquely present among M1 and M3 strains. Further research is required to establish whether these biomarkers contribute to specific M1 and M3 characteristics, such as their TSS inducing potential and association with necrotizing fasciitis. We hypothesized that acquisition of novel genetic elements could have created unusually successful clones the, thus explaining the increase in frequency and severity of invasive GAS infections in the late1980s. Mixed-genome DNA-DNA microarray analysis showed that contemporary M1 and M28 strains in The Netherlands have evolved from ancestral strains through a series of transduction events: the core genome of all strains was identical and variation in prophage content accounted for the differences in genome composition over time. Acquisition of phage-encoded virulence factors is likely to have contributed to an overall increase in GAS virulence over time.\"],\n",

       "  'Description': ['In this thesis I studied how long-term soil contamination affects microbial populations and processes, ecosystem properties and functional stability. I also investigated which parameters are suitable as indicators of soil quality in long-term contaminated soils. I found that contamination had a negative impact on many examined microbial parameters, e.g. biomasses, respiration and growth rate (Chapter 2). Some parameters like protozoan biomass and metabolic quotient did not show any effect of stress probably due to strong variation. No single parameter indicated effects of both stressors. Thus, a set of indicators is needed to assess the condition of contaminated soils. In chapter 3 I tested information indices as a tool to describe ecological succession in belowground ecosystems. I used data from a primary succession on the island of Schiermonnikoog. I found that the indices that describe both size and organization of ecosystem followed trends predicted by the theory, but at the same time they were strongly correlated with total system biomass. Therefore I could not say whether the observed trends reflect succession or simply the build up of biomass. However, analysis of relative indices that are independent of biomass and describe only the organization of the ecosystem, showed that succession occurred only in soils between 0 and 10 years old. Since other authors clearly have shown that there has been succession in these soils in, I conclude that the relative information indices are not sensitive indicators of succession. In contaminated soils, however, relative information indices were sensitive to stress caused by high concentrations of copper and by low pH (chapter 4). Stress affected the organization of belowground ecosystems as predicted by the theory. Stressed soils were more vulnerable to external perturbations and less efficient in processing energy than unstressed soils. As the relative information indices responded to stress in predictable manner and each of them revealed effects of both stresses I concluded that these indices are useful indicators of environmental stress. In contrary the absolute indices responded in unpredicted manner to stress and therefore are not suitable as indicators of stress. In chapters 5 and 6, I used “stress on stress” experiments to test the functional stability of soil respiration and bacterial growth rate to additional stress or disturbance in experimentally contaminated soils. The results described in Chapter 5 seemed to confirm the hypothesis that microbial processes in not-stressed soils are more stable to additional stress. The microbial processes showed different responses to disturbances (Chapter 6) than to stress (Chapter 5). In some cases stressed soils appeared to be more stable to additional disturbance than not-stressed soils, in other cases the opposite was found. In chapter 7, I tested the functional stability in a real field situation with zinc and cadmium pollution. In this experiment processes responded differently than in the former experiments. Probably the response of a process depends on whether a co-tolerance towards a given (subsequent) stress was developed during exposure to the first stress.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Since the foot-and-mouth disease epidemics in Europe in 2001 the use of emergency vaccination, if an outbreak occurs, has become more prominent in EU legislation. Since pigs infected with foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) excrete huge amounts of virus they are considered as amplifiers of the disease and therefore the effect of vaccination on pigs is of great interest, especially in areas with high pig density. The aim of this thesis was to establish if and how soon (herd-) immunity in pigs is induced by vaccination and, furthermore, to study the correlation between immune responses after vaccination and protection against challenge.\\n\\r\\nTransmission of FMDV and the effect of vaccination were studied in animal experiments in which half of the pigs were challenged with FMDV and transmission to contact pigs was studied. The outcome of the experiments was quantified using mathematical models. It was shown that, in the used model, pigs were protected against challenge at two weeks after homologous (vaccine virus same as field virus) as well as after heterologous (vaccine virus other than field virus, but within same serotype) vaccination. After challenge at one week after vaccination, transmission to all contact pigs was observed. However, vaccination did lead to a significant reduction of virus excretion after challenge, which will lead to reduction of virus in the environment which will reduce the risk of transmission to other herds. Vaccination with a 4-fold vaccine dose reduced the number of contact infections after challenge at one week after vaccination. Moreover, virus excretion of vaccinated-infected pigs was reduced even more. \\n\\r\\nFor decision making regarding control of the disease, it is important that transmission in non-vaccinated and vaccinated pigs is quantified. Quantified transmission parameters can be used in quantitative modelling, which is regarded as an essential tool for developing strategies in preparation of an outbreak and for predicting and evaluating the effectiveness of control policies during an outbreak. In this thesis, estimates for the transmission rate ß, the infectious period T and the reproduction ratio R for both non-vaccinated and vaccinated pigs were quantified with the results of our studies. It was shown that contact structure influenced the transmission rate and that the between-pen transmission-rate was significantly smaller than the within-pen transmission-rate in non-vaccinated pigs. Vaccination reduced ß, T and R of FMDV in pigs as soon as one week post vaccination and for the group vaccinated with a 4-fold vaccine dose R was estimated to be 1, which will probably be sufficient to reduce between-herd transmission sufficiently.\\n\\r\\n\\tFurthermore, it was shown that in individual pigs, the (reduced) virus excretion after infection was correlated with the neutralising antibody-titre at the moment of infection. After vaccination, IgA responses could be demonstrated and an indication that these responses play a possible role in protection against infection was found. After infection, a prolonged IgA response was demonstrated which was previously only described for carrier cattle and therefore needs further investigation. Also, it was demonstrated that after vaccination and infection systemic and mucosal isotype specific immune responses (IgG, IgM and IgA) were comparable. \\n\\r\\n\\tIt was concluded that the currently used vaccines are effective in reducing virus transmission as soon as two weeks after vaccination. More research on optimal vaccine composition and dose is recommended. The correlates of protection that were found might be useful in future vaccine-research.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Exploring Chronic Fatigue Syndrome in Adolescents'],\n",
       "  'Description': [\"The research for this thesis has been conducted in three consecutive studies: Fatigue in Teenagers-I (FIT-I) in 2002, FIT-II in 2004 and FIT-III in 2006. In each FIT-study different research questions were formulated on the basis of the biopsychosocial model. The three FIT-studies resulted in the chapters of this thesis. These chapters appear in the chronological order of the FIT-studies. FIT-I and FIT-II both have a cross-sectional study design in which adolescents with CFS are compared with healthy adolescents. FIT-III is a follow-up of the patients who participated in FIT-I and FIT-II. Chapter 2 focuses on a constitutional biological factor, which may partly explain the symptoms of fatigue and pain in the CFS. The main question is whether constitu-tional laxity of the connective tissues is more frequently present in adolescents with CFS than in healthy controls. \\n\\r\\nChapter 3 investigates health beliefs, one of the psychological factors that determine health behaviour both in the adolescents and in their parents. Although health behaviour is often the focus of treatment, very little is known about the beliefs in families with an adolescent with CFS, neither as a predisposing nor as a maintaining factor. \\n\\r\\nChapter 4 reports the findings of research in the relation between fatigue and other somatic symptoms, both in adolescents with CFS and healthy adolescents. Chapter 5 is the first article of the FIT-II study. In this chapter the association of symp-toms in children and in their parents is explored within the biopsychosocial model, with possible genetic contributions on the one hand, and possible psychosocial contributions on the other hand. The second goal of the study was to establish the relation between fatigue and psychological distress in the adolescents with CFS. Chapter 6 explores a set of symptoms in the CFS adolescents, namely neurocognitive symptoms, which are frequently present without a clear substrate. We applied a neuro-cognitive measurement tool for interference control. The tool measures the ability to protect a response from interruption by competing responses or events. The goal of the study was to investigate whether adolescents with CFS show a lesser degree of interference control than healthy adolescents. The second goal was to explore the importance of familial factors by examining the interference control in the parents of both groups. \\n\\r\\nChapter 7 is another reflection on a possible neurobiological basis for CFS. Sensory gating is the ability to be protected from the load of sensory information by filtering sensory stimuli, and is a critical function of all sensory systems. We hypothesized that adolescents with CFS and possibly one of their parents would show deficient sensory gating. A deficient sensory gating might be one of the biological factors predisposing or maintaining CFS-like symptoms. \\r\\nChapter 8 is based on the hypothesis that children's early object relations may possibly have an etiologic relationship to CFS. It may be one of the psychological factors involved. Alexithymia, defined as an inability to recognize and describe emotions, has its origin in an insecure and disorganized development of attachment in childhood. It is hypothesized that adolescents with CFS exhibit more alexithymia than healthy adolescents. The second hypothesis is that alexithymia unfavourably affects the outcome of CFS. To answer this last question we used the data of the FIT-III study. \\n\\r\\nChapter 9, finally, is the general discussion in which the findings from the three FIT-studies are discussed within the biopsychosocial model.\"],\n",

       "  'Description': ['This study focuses on the establishment of pronominal dependencies in individuals with Broca’s aphasia. It offers insight in how the fields of aphasiology and linguistics can meet and can help broaden one’s knowledge base on this particular linguistic phenomenon and its breakdown in Broca’s aphasia. In addition to data from language breakdown, data from preschool-children examining the same phenomena are also provided. The two language systems share the same insufficient ability to implement grammatical knowledge as a consequence of a lack of processing resources. As such, children’s and Broca’s patients’ performance patterns can be compared and more can be learned about the general organisation of knowledge of reference assignment. The experimental results provide evidence for a hierarchical organisation of the healthy, impaired and developing linguistic systems. They point towards a reduction in the capacity of Broca’s patients to process syntactic information on time. In healthy non-brain-damaged adults syntactic operations are the most automatic (economical) operations used to establish pronoun-antecedent dependencies. The syntactic operations block other possible operations that can potentially be used to establish these kinds of dependencies. In Broca’s patients and pre-school children, syntactic information is not ready on time. As a consequence, other levels of information, such as discourse or the non-linguistic level, come into play and provide information for pronoun resolution sometimes resulting in erroneous dependencies. The observed error patterns in these populations thus reveal a competition between narrow syntax and other systems. This is a multidisciplinary study and is of relevance to any scholar in the fields of neurolinguistics, first language acquisition, theoretical linguistics, psycholinguistics and clinical linguistics.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Cystic fibrosis : a hereditary inflammatory process'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease is characterized by an exaggerated, and extended inflammation, with a massive influx of neutrophils and high concentrations of interleukin (IL)-8 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Furthermore, patients with CF have chronic bacterial airway infection, particularly with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Chronic inflammation and infection lead to structural lung damage and impairment of lung function, finally resulting in respiratory insufficiency. Inflammation starts early in the disease process, even without detectable infection. This in combination with the finding of CFTR mRNA transcripts in blood neutrophils has led to the hypothesis that CF neutrophils are intrinsically altered and that inflammation in CF might be intrinsic. Calcium plays a critical role in several neutrophil functions and regulation of neutrophil migration to the site of infection. We show that fMLP-induced intracellular calcium (Ca2+i) mobilization responses of peripheral blood neutrophils of clinically stable CF patients are increased compared to healthy control neutrophils and these responses cannot be mimicked when healthy control neutrophils were primed with the systemic immune activator TNF-α. Neutrophils differentiated ex-vivo from cord blood CD34+ progenitor cells of a CF and a healthy newborn also displayed an enhanced fMLP-induced Ca2+i response, suggesting an intrinsic neutrophil defect in CF. Furthermore migration of CF neutrophils compared to healthy control neutrophils was enhanced and this migration was abrogated when Ca2+ was depleted from the cells. These results suggest a possible link between the altered Ca2+i mobilization responses and the massive influx of CF neutrophils into the lungs. Studies evaluating inflammation in peripheral blood have shown that inflammation can also be monitored systemically in CF patients with moderate disease. We show that even in young uninfected patients with mild disease priming of peripheral blood neutrophils using expression of newly developed priming associated cellular markers (MoPhabs A17 and A27) is significantly increased. We furthermore show that not only neutrophil priming state is increased, but young CF children with normal lung function and mild disease also display a pro-inflammatory plasma cytokine profile. Structural lung damage in CF can be assessed by chest radiographs. We describe a good correlation between CF chest radiograph scoring systems, pulmonary function tests (PFTs), and other clinical parameters of disease in adolescents with mild to moderate disease. Furthermore we show longitudinal worsening of chest radiograph scores in very young children with CF, while lung function determined by interrupter resistance (Rint) remained normal for most children after 3-years of follow-up. It seems reasonable to intervene in the inflammatory process by starting anti-inflammatory therapy at a young age. We assessed the effects of hydrofluoroalkane beclomethasone dipropionate (HFA-BDP, Qvar) on lung function, inflammation in peripheral blood, chest radiograph scores, bacterial colonization, ETCO, and quality of life in 57 young children with CF. Children treated for 3 years with HFA-BDP show less progression of lung function decline (mean difference between HFA-BDP and placebo treated children 7.5% less decline over 3 years). HFA-BDP treated children also display lower plasma concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and soluble adhesion molecules than placebo treated children.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Gene polymorphisms in fibrotic sarcoidosis'],\n",
       "  'Description': [\"Sarcoidosis is a systemic disease of unknown cause, which is characterized by the presence of noncaseating granulomas in one or multiple organs. In approximately 90 percent of patients with sarcoidosis, the disease is manifested as pulmonary granulomas. Although parenchymal abnormalities often resolve spontaneously, about 20-25% of cases will ultimately develop pulmonary fibrosis. Fibrosis of the lung parenchyma is associated with poor pulmonary function and a bleak prognosis with increased morbidity and mortality. Fibrosis is characterized by a disproportionate increase in extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. The exuberant ECM production is believed to originate from an imbalance between cytokines involved in tissue healing and remodeling. Sarcoidosis is likely to be a genetically complex disease that involves a combination of genetic loci (polygenic) conferring disease predilection or phenotypic variation of disease manifestation. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP's) in genes that encode for components involved in tissue injury and repair may influence the risk of developing pulmonary fibrosis in sarcoidosis. The effects of genetic variation on sarcoidosis phenotypes may appear as changes of such parameters as radiography, lung function or serum levels of the disease marker. The results described in this thesis strongly support the influence of genetic variation on the disease parameters that are used to describe the phenotypes of pulmonary sarcoidosis. These parameters include disease marker levels in serum, evolution of chest X-ray, and lung function data. The results show that a number of SNPs can add to the propensity to develop pulmonary fibrosis as seen for TGF-β3 polymorphisms in relation to radiographic evolution, or that a combination of SNPs on one allele (haplotypes) may predict the odds of developing chronic sarcoidosis and fibrosis in males. Gene polymorphisms in genes of disease markers ACE, KL-6 and YKL-40 inform us about their influence on protein functionality. The identification or evaluation of polymorphisms in genes that encode proteins which are or may be used as sarcoidosis disease markers clearly underline the relevance of considering gene polymorphisms in an attempt to identify normal and deviating levels of disease markers. For the clinician, however, having to account for the genetic variation of a disease marker may be cumbersome. Means to circumvent the potentially expansive number of reference intervals that are based on e.g. gender, age, length, and gene polymorphisms can be accomplished by formulating a simple algorithm that accounts for any variable known to influence the measures of a marker. As illustrated in this thesis, the Z-score offers a useful way to apply genetically-specific marker levels in practice. In order to grasp the genetic influence on the vast and complex pathways which lead to pulmonary fibrosis in sarcoidosis, the expansion of useful fibrosis parameters are needed to be able to give the affected individual a proper risk assessment and a fitting treatment regimen. The associations described in this thesis will hopefully prompt future investigations into the delineation of the functional roles of polymorphisms in genes that are involved in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis in sarcoidosis.\"],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Novel strategies to improve the patency of vascular prostheses'],\n",
       "  'Description': [\"Two novel strategies to improve the patency of vascular prostheses are described in this thesis. To improve the outcome of synthetic vascular bypass surgery, cell seeding is a promising concept that has extensively been investigated and is still evolving. To improve the short term effects due to acute thrombotic occlusion, thrombogenicity of prosthetic material could be reduced by both 'endothelialization' of the graft or heparin bonding to the endoluminal surface. Both strategies potentially also reduce intimal hyperplasia (IH), as both endothelial cells and heparin are known to influence the process of IH development. Therefore, the emphases of the studies described were: 'auto-endothelialization' and 'thrombogenicity-reduction' of the vascular PTFE graft. The central questions of this thesis were: 1. Can auto-endothelialization of grafts be realised using anti-CD34 coating? 2. Does this coating reduce intimal hyperplasia? And 3. Does heparin immobilization reduce thrombogenicity of vascular grafts? 4. Is there a systemic effect of the locally immobilized heparin on the vascular grafts? To answer these questions in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo studies were performed, which are described in this thesis. Overall, we conclude that auto-endothelialization by antibody coating and heparin immobilization are techniques that have the potential to improve the patency of small diameter vascular grafts. From both the in vivo and in vitro anti-CD34 studies we conclude that the concept of auto-endothelialization can be realized by this coating technique. The 'perfect antibody' however, is not found yet, as a threefold increase of neo-intima formation was the result of the anti-CD34 coating and a-specific cells attached to the coated surface. From the ex vivo study we can conclude that heparin immobilization successfully reduces the thrombogenicity of ePTFE grafts. The major conclusion from the in vivo study, using the heparinized grafts is the lack of antibodies against the locally immobilized heparin, which is of great clinical importance. As stated earlier, the ideal conduit for (semi)acute vascular bypass procedures is the one that the surgeon can simply pick off the shelf, implant in the patient and which also resembles the patency of venous bypasses. At the time of writing, on the basis of the studies described in this thesis and the literature available, this specific heparinized graft seems to be the best choice. Of course, longer follow up studies are needed to delineate whether heparin immobilized prostheses truly perform as good as venous bypass grafts do. In theory, both reduction of thrombogenicity and reduction of IH might benefit this clinical dilemma.\"],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Malaria, anaemia and antimalarial drug resistance in African children'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Malaria-associated anaemia is a potentially preventable cause of severe morbidity and mortality in children < 5years of age, in areas of high malaria transmission in sub-Saharan Africa. In a cross-sectional study of 3586 children, 80% were anaemic (haemoglobin [Hb]<11g/dL) and 3% had severe anaemia (Hb<5g/dL). Risk factors for anaemia included age < 3years, malaria parasitaemia, previous ineffective therapy and lack of bednet use. Since the emergence of drug-resistant parasite strains, the frequency of occurrence of severe anaemia is rising. In a review of 1116 randomly selected hospital records for children hospitalized in 2002, we found that 90% had anaemia, 20% were severely anaemic and 20% received a blood transfusion. Twelve percent of severely anaemic children died and 52% of the malaria-related mortality was due to severe anaemia. Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) has been advocated to prevent the development of antimalarial drug resistance, but ACT is expensive and currently in limited supply. In a meta-analysis of 4472 African children, Amodiaquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, an alternative non-ACT, was as effective as ACT in some settings. We conducted a randomized controlled trial of 600 Kenyan children with uncomplicated malaria whom we treated with either one or three days of artesunate [AS] plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine [SP] or SP alone. The parasitological failure rates on day 28 after excluding new infections by parasite genotyping were 33%, 21%, and 43%, for those treated with SP+AS for one day, SP+ AS for 3 days or SP alone, respectively. Adding AS to SP, in a setting with high SP resistance did not markedly improve the efficacy of the combination. The impact of introducing effective antimalarial therapy on case fatality was investigated using 4 years of surveillance data. When increasing proportions of children received an effective antimalarial therapy the case fatality rates decreased markedly (from 11 to 3.5%). We used data from the randomized trial described above to evaluate the effect of therapy on haematological recovery and anaemia prevalence. By 28 days after treatment, only 18% of the children had achieved haematological recovery and there was a modest reduction in the prevalence of anaemia in all treatment arms. AS+SP did not result in better haematological outcomes compared to SP alone. A possible explanation for this is the high failure rates in all treatment arms and the short follow-up period. The treatment of severe malaria-related anaemia includes administration of blood transfusion, an intervention that carries a substantial risk for HIV transmission in sub-Saharan Africa. Three key factors were found to determine the beneficial effect of a transfusion using a decision analysis. These were, a high risk of mortality without a transfusion, a low risk of HIV contaminating the blood supply and high transfusion effectiveness. Children who have survived an episode of severe anaemia stand a higher chance of getting another more severe and sometimes fatal, episode of severe anaemia. For this risk group, the rebound phenomenon may be prevented by repeated administration of curative doses of an effective antimalarial therapy regardless of the presence of malaria parasites.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Carbohydrates act in many cellular functions and biological processes such as cell-cell recognition and adhesion, inflammation, fertilization, signal transduction, and development. In this context, structural information is required to understand molecular mechanisms involving carbohydrates. The placental glycoprotein hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) indirectly stimulates the corpus luteum to produce progesterone during the first trimester of pregnancy, until the placenta itself acquires the ability to produce this pregnancy-sustaining steroid. Nowadays, the therapeutic glycoprotein is produced in several ways, including isolation from the urine of pregnant woman and recombinant production protocols. In view of the importance of the glycosylation pattern for biological activity, it is essential to analyze the glycan chains connected to the protein backbone of recombinant materials. In the present work the “high-mannosylation” glycosylation pattern of the N-glycans of hCG expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115 is reported. Detailed neutral oligosaccharide structures in the range Man8GlcNAc2 - Man15GlcNAc2 could be established. Phosphate-containing oligosaccharides ranged from Man9PGlcNAc2 to Man13PGlcNAc2. As glycosylations are site-specific, also attention was paid to the N-glycosylation pattern per attachment site. Comparison of the N-glycosylation profiles of hCG produced in the P. pastoris GS115 and X-33 strains showed typical differences, i.e. high- versus hyper-mannosylation, a finding of high importance for the therapeutic glycoprotein production in P. pastoris cells. Additionally, an optimized culturing protocol for the production of hCG in GS115 cells was established. This new route made it possible to produce biologically active 15N-labeled hCG in good quantities against a realistic price, of importance for detailed conformational analysis by NMR spectroscopy. Another part of the thesis work focuses on the flexibility of the Asn-34 linked N-glycans of bovine RNase B (1-124) and BS (21-124; prepared from B via subtilisin digestion), in the context of the observation that the N-glycan releasing enzyme PNGase-F is active on native RNase BS but not on RNase B. Structural investigations by NMR spectroscopy showed that the glycan at Asn-34 was more mobile in RNase BS (now Asn-14) than in RNase B. MD simulations indicated that the region around Asn-34 in RNase B is relatively rigid, whereby the α-helix (residues 1-20) had a stabilizing effect. In RNase BS, the α-helix (residues 23-32) was significantly more flexible. A model of the RNase B(S) / PNGase-F complex could be built allowing to explain the difference in enzymatic activity. A third part of the thesis work focuses on conformational aspects of proteoglycans. NMR spectroscopy and molecular modeling studies were performed on five octasaccharides isolated from shark cartilage proteoglycan CS-D, which present different binding properties towards mAb 473HD, but also to mAb CS-56 and MO-225. It could be established that the sulfate group at position 2 of GlcA in disaccharide unit GlcA2S(α1-3)GalNAc6S, as wells as the presence of an exo-cyclic negative tail in disaccharide units GlcA(α1-3)GalNAc6S and Δ4,5HexA(α1-3)GalNAc6S are important for antibody recognition. These results will form the basis of further studies focused on the unravelling of the structures of the complexes between CS-D and recognizing antibodies.'],\n",

       "  'Description': [\"This thesis encloses studies which are separate analyses of the PRIMIS Study. In the PRIMIS Study a cohort of healthy women who expected their first child was followed up from early pregnancy to one year after delivery. Self-report questionnaires regarding psychosocial factors, urogenital symptoms and pregnancy related back and pelvic girdle pain were distributed to participants at 12, 24 and 36 weeks gestation, and 3 and 12 months after delivery. Obstetric data were obtained from midwifes and gynecologists/obstetricians. Pregnancy and childbirth are both physically and emotionally impressive life events. Pregnancy related symptoms such as back and pelvic girdle pain and depressive and urogenital symptoms are highly prevalent during pregnancy. The investigation of the interaction of physical symptoms and childbirth with psychosocial factors could improve our understanding of pregnancy related problems. Firstly, an overview of the literature on pregnancy related back and pelvic girdle pain led us to the conclusion that its etiology is multicausal and risk factors need further investigation. Therefore, we set out to examine the influence of psychosocial factors on pregnancy related back and pelvic girdle pain. We confirmed that the most predictive risk factor for back pain in and after pregnancy is history of back pain. We found no clear association between psychosocial factors and the occurrence of back pain during and after pregnancy. In addition we made an inventory of the Dutch situation regarding self reported so called “pelvic instability” and presented a mobility scale, designed for use in pregnancy: the Pregnancy Mobility Index (PMI). Pregnancy Mobility Index has been shown to be a reliable and valid questionnaire well suited for use during and after pregnancy. Using this questionnaire, we found that women reporting pelvic instability are less mobile than women without pain or women suffering from back pain only. No association was found between delivery-related factors and pelvic instability. Secondly is it important to identify factors that are associated with the risk of emergency cesarean and instrumental vaginal birth because they impose greater physical and emotional morbidity on both mother and infant than normal vaginal delivery. We examined what psychosocial factors are associated with the risk for instrumental and surgical delivery. We found that social support from the woman's partner in pregnancy, lack of depressive symptoms and specific personality traits are not protective against instrumentally assisted vaginal birth or emergency cesarean section. Finally, we assessed the association between depressive symptoms and overactive bladder (OAB) syndrome and urge and stress urinary incontinence (UUI and SUI), controlling for confounding socioeconomic, psychosocial, behavioral and biomedical factors.In univariate analysis urinary incontinence as well as OAB syndrome were significant associated with depressive symptoms. However, after adjusting for possible confounding factors, only OAB syndrome remained significantly associated. All finding are discussed and recommendations are given for clinical practice.\"],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Antineoplastic drugs: Occupational exposure and health risks'],\n",
       "  'Description': [\"Antineoplastic drugs are pharmaceuticals commonly used to treat cancer (and some non-neoplastic diseases), which are generally referred to as 'chemotherapy'. Oncology nurses are exposed to these drugs via the skin of hands during daily nursing activities, even when protective gloves are being used. Results of tests on bulk and surface contamination samples confirmed that patients intravenously treated with cyclophosphamide excrete the unmetabolized drug. The introduction of new guidelines and regulations on working with antineoplastic drugs, the use of more closed preparation- and infusion-systems and the consequent growing awareness of nurses working with antineoplastic drugs has decreased exposure to antineoplastic drugs considerably. Due to an increase in number of chemotherapy treatments and centralisation of chemotherapy to specialised departments in hospitals, the average weekly exposure level of an oncology nurse has not markedly changed over time, while low and high exposures occur less frequent. The identification of the patient as a source of contamination and exposure makes it very complicated to further reduce exposure to antineoplastic drugs of nurses. Based on current dermal exposure levels to antineoplastic drugs approximately 50% of the population of oncology nurses have an increased risk of a prolonged time to pregnancy compared with non-exposed nurses, and around 10% of Dutch oncology nurses have an increased risk of a premature delivery and delivering a child with a low birth weight. Other effects on reproduction like spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, gender of offspring, and congenital malformations were not related to exposure to antineoplastic drugs. The risk of non-lymphocytic leukaemia among oncology nurses after being exposed for 40 years to current dermal exposure levels of cyclophosphamide was estimated to be well below the target risk (one extra cancer case per 10 million per year) and the maximum tolerable risk (one extra cancer case per 100,000 per year) in the Netherlands. However, this estimate is for cyclophosphamide only and in a worst-case exposure scenario the estimated leukaemia risk exceeded the target risk, so the cancer risk among oncology nurses exposed to antineoplastic drugs should not be ignored. The identification of occupational exposure to antineoplastic drugs in sectors outside the hospital environment (i.e. veterinary medicine, home care, nursing homes and industrial laundries) showed that the number of workers potentially exposed to antineoplastic drugs is larger than previously estimated. Exposure levels in these sectors can potentially be higher than in the hospital environment, because exposure routes are complex and awareness of the hazard (and therefore use of protective measures) is limited.\"],\n",

One third of these stroke patients die within the first year, while 41% experience long term disabilities. This makes stroke a major disease in medical and in socio-economic terms. Not just on society but also, and far most, on the afflicted individual and his or her environment the impact is felt of a sustained stroke. Following a stroke a person's independence in moving about may be significantly compromised. The expected level of walking to a great extent determines the expected level of activities of daily living and possible discharge to home. \\n\\r\\nThis thesis describes the long term recovery of hemiplegic gait in severely affected stroke patients. Based on the application of a repeated measurement research design, data were obtained within the first post-stroke year period. This information subsequently enabled the identification of time-related changes and was used to address the following main questions: \\n\\r\\nAre intensive stroke rehabilitation programmes, implemented within the early and subacute post-stroke phases, worthwhile in terms of long term functional gains and can this long term recovery be estimated early after stroke onset for better individualized reliable therapeutic goal setting and discharge planning? \\n\\r\\nFor this purpose, early and late recovery patterns were studied as functional recovery after stroke tends to be non-linear and time-dependent. Subsequently, this information was used in the interpretation of some of the mechanisms involved in the long term recovery of hemiplegic gait and the impact of intensity of therapeutic interventions on this recovery. \\n\\r\\nThe main findings of the studies presented in the first part of this thesis indicate predictive relationships between early determinants and late outcome and the relevance of measuring frequently and longitudinally in order to take into consideration the non-linear time-dependent relationship of covariates with recovery of gait after stroke. In the second part it is demonstrated that the long term effects of intensity of stroke rehabilitation, implemented during the initial 20 post-stroke weeks, are maintained for up to one year. However, a significant number of patients with incomplete recovery showed improvements or deterioration of walking ability and ADL beyond the error threshold between 6 and 12 months post-stroke.\\n\\r\\nSeveral mechanisms involved in stroke recovery are discussed, such as recovery of penumbral tissues, neural plasticity, resolution of diaschisis and behavioural compensation strategies. Rehabilitation is believed to modulate this logistic pattern of recovery, most likely by interacting with these underlying processes. Our prediction models suggest that outcome is largely defined within the first weeks post-stroke.\"],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Different aspects of thalidomide treatment and stem cell transplantation in multiple myeloma patients'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Multiple myeloma (MM) is an haematological malignancy caused by an unrestrained proliferation of plasma cells (monoclonally differentiated B-cells), and part of the white blood cell count. This proliferation infiltrates the blood forming skeletal bone marrow, producing osteoclastic factors, causing local bone destruction and bone resorption, causing bone pain as one of the major symptoms. The clonally transformed plasma cells all produce the same homogeneous immunoglobulin, the so called paraprotein or M-component. This paraprotein can be detected in urine and blood serum, can cause renal failure and is indicative for a malignant condition. These malignant cells are located the blood forming bone marrow and can be detected by a bone marrow biopsy. Anemia or hypogammaglobulinaemia (immunodeficiency) can be caused by bone marrow failure due to massive infiltration of the blood forming bone marrow. The diagnosis of multiple myeloma is based on a combination of radiological, laboratory and pathological findings. For the diagnosis of MM more than 30% bone marrow infiltration with plasma cells should be present according to the WHO classification of multiple myeloma. The types of plasma cell infiltration, the immunophenotype, the accumulating chromosomal abnormalities and the microenvironment are important for tumor survival and differentiation (chapter 2). After making the diagnosis a therapy should be started. The combination of melphalan and prednisone has been standard therapy for many years. Although not proven, the only possible curative option for multiple myeloma patients is chemotherapy followed by a stem cell transplantation (SCT). A SCT can be autologous (stem cells from the patient itself) or allogeneic (stem cells from a HLA-identical family member or a matched unrelated donor). The chemotherapy combination of vincristine, doxorubicin and dexamethason (VAD) is used in many cases. and applied to eliminate the malignant plasma cells. It also eradicates the patients own blood forming haematopoiesis, resulting in bone marrow failure with slow regeneration. The regeneration of the haematopoietic bone marrow depends on the type of conditioning pre SCT (non-myeloablative or myeloablative and the method of transplantation (allogeneic or autologous). It is important to be familiar with the normal regeneration of the blood forming bone marrow, but complications can occur during regeneration with characteristic bone marrow morphology and significant dyshaematopoiesis (chapter 3). During the pretransplant period and depending on the kind of pre-treatment there may be hypoplasia, residual disease and fibrosis. Also the presence of residual tumor cells in the bone marrow after the autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation is important, as their presence can indicate recurrent or refractory disease (chapter 4). On the other hand the presence of a low percentage of tumor cells after the transplantation can be cleared due to graft versus tumor response and no therapy is needed. Except for VAD therapy and melphalan, thalidomide is more and more used in multiple myeloma patients. A new active immunomodulatory and anti-angiogenic drug, with a long and impressive history. First synthesized as a sedative and tranquillizer, at that time called Softenon. In pregnant women it worked very well to treat morning sickness and help them sleep. It took more than four years to find out that the drug interfered with the development of the fetus and an epidemic of children followed, born with severe malformations of the limps, ears and internal organs. Thalidomide was at that time also tested on different kinds of cancer, but because it was consigned as one of the largest medical tragedies in history, it was not used anymore for many years. After more than 25 years thalidomide made a comeback and the drug is tested on many malignant tumors. The anti-tumor effect in multiple myeloma however is one of the most effective ones sofar. In the bone marrow the anti-angiogenic effect of thalidomide could be shown in bone marrow biopsies, taken at different time points during the treatment with VAD or TAD Although only a very small amount of patients, the anti-angiogenic effect of thalidomide on the microenvironment like the amount of vessels and the endothelial cells could be visualized in these bone marrow findings (chapter 5). As expected thalidomide treatment also has side effects, including sedation, constipation, dry skin, itching and others. Most important the combination of regular multi-chemotherapy with adriamycin, thalidomide and prednisone in multiple myeloma patients was reported to be associated with increased life threatening venous thromboembolism (deep venous thrombosis and lung embolism), being much higher than in patients receiving the more conventional chemotherapy. Although multiple pro-coagulating haemostatic alterations are known in MM patients, high levels of FVIII and von Willebrand factor (VWF) and a possible disturbance in fibrinolysis were likely to be of clinical importance. The plasma hypofibrinolytic activity,VWF and FVIII potential was measured in a large number of multiple myeloma patients at time of diagnosis, during chemotherapy with either vincristine or thalidomide in combination with adriamycin and doxorubicin, and after autologous stem cell transplantation, as the fibrinolysis of an already formed thrombus could be reduced. No evidence for hypofibrinolysis in myeloma patients at the time of diagnosis was observed (chapter 6). Although a significant increase in clot lysis time occurred during both types of chemotherapy, which may result in a higher risk of venous thrombosis, there was no extra increase due to thalidomide treatment compared to the more conventional VAD treatment. But besides the hypofibrinolysis also high levels of coagulation FVIII and von Willebrand factor were shown to be important, especially when thalidomide was combined with anthracyclines and/or dexamethasone. The levels of factor VIII and von Willebrand factor (VWF) were evaluated in the blood of a large series of patients, during consecutive treatment phases of MM patients, randomized to receive TAD (thalidomide, adriamycin, dexamethason) or VAD (vincristine), followed by high dose therapy (melphalan), and autologous stem cell transplantation. Levels of VWF and FVIII increased to a similar extent during both VAD and TAD treatment (chapter 7). This may explain the increased thrombotic risk during induction treatment, but also this does not explain the increased incidence of thromboembolic events during the thalidomide treatment. Although the cause of this elevated thromboembolic risk is not known, we know now that the extra thrombotic risk in practice can be prevented by using low dosed heparin during thalidomide treatment. Concluding we can say that thalidomide in combination with dexamethason followed by stem cell transplantation is an effective therapy for MM patients. The elevated thrombotic risk due to this treatment can cause life-threatening situations. Although we found that hypofibrinolysis, coagulation factor VIII and VWF are elevated in multiple myeloma patients, these factors do not explain the extra increased risk for this side effects during the thalidomide treatment, compared to the more conventional chemotherapy. Other explanations must be responsible for the increased risk of thrombo-embolic events in multiple myeloma patient treated with thalidomide therapy and are waiting to be investigated.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Phosphorylation is of major importance in cell signalling processes like cell migration, cell proliferation and cell differentiation within higher eukaryotic organisms. Therefore, the balance between phosphorylation, mediated by kinases, and dephosphorylation, mediated by phosphatases, must be tightly controlled. Kinases as well as phosphatases are known to play a role in diseases like cancer and diabetes. Future research on PTPs will give important information about the exact roles they fulfill in signal transduction and the implications they have in diseases. The aim of this work is the elucidation of the regulatory mechanism of oxidation induced inhibition of Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Phosphatases (RPTPs). RPTPa activity is inhibited by the formation of stable dimers upon oxidation. The crystal structure of RPTPa shows that a wedge-like structure of one subunit inserts into the catalytic cleft of the other, thereby preventing substrate binding. The cysteine of the membrane distal domain (RPTP-D2) acts as a redox sensor since mutating this residue into a serine prevents the formation of stable dimers and renders the phosphatase active after oxidation. In chapter II an antibody is described that specifically recognizes oxidized cysteines in the PTP-loop. We found that the cysteine of RPTPa-D2 is indeed more susceptible to oxidation than the cysteine of RPTPa-D1. In chapter III we investigated whether differential oxidation is a common theme in RPTPs. The guanidinium group of a nearby serine appears to define the susceptibility of the catalytic site cysteine. Chapter IV shows the crystal structure of oxidized RPTPa-D2 in which a sulphenamide form was identified just as was found in the crystal structure of PTP1B. This form appeared to be reversible and stable up to 24 hours. Whether dimerization induced inhibition could be a general regulatory mechanism for RPTPs was investigated in chapter V. The intracellular domains of RPTPa, RPTPm, LAR and CD45 all formed stable dimers upon oxidation. Besides they all showed profound conformational changes in response to oxidation. Here, we propose the following model. RPTPs exist on the cell membrane as preformed active dimers. In the presence of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), the conserved second, membrane distal catalytic domain functions as a redox sensor, transducing the oxidation information to the first, membrane proximal catalytically active domain. The inhibitory wedge of one subunit will subsequently occlude the catalytic cleft of the other, thereby preventing substrate binding, rendering the RPTP inactive. Since the oxidation of the cysteines is reversible, reduction of the cysteine of the second catalytic domain will reform the RPTPs to an active dimeric state. Taken together, we propose that the activity of RPTPs is regulated by an oxidation-induced dimerization mechanism.'],\n",

In the last years, the number of biomedical articles and journals is growing exponentially. Scientists might not find the information they want because of the large number of publications. Therefore a system was constructed that automatically extracts very important information from text. This information includes gene- and protein names, (point) mutations, protein-protein interactions and biologically interesting keywords like tissues or diseases. We named this system CONAN. In contrast to other text mining systems, CONAN does not introduce new algorithms, but takes well-known programs and combines them to get the best available results. Integration of new methods and algorithms is very easy. We show that with this approach, CONAN performs very well in all evaluations. We also show the various applications of CONAN, a command-line tool, a webserver and the integration of the data in a gene-interaction network.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Congenital myasthenic syndrome of Brahman cattle'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['The postsynaptic congenital myasthenic syndrome that is the subject of this thesis is caused by a deficiency of nAChR at the neuromuscular junction, resulting from homozygosity for a null mutation in the ε-subunit gene (CHRNE 470del20). To date, this represents the only naturally occurring CMS in animals to have been described at the DNA level. This thesis covers all steps from the initial discovery and case description, to the diagnosis, development of a diagnostic test, and screening of the population, to predictive modelling and assessment of its impact on the Brahman breed. \\n\\r\\nIn Chapter 2, the first presentation of calves with CMS is described. The clinical presentation was quite unlike that of any disease previously described in cattle, but reminiscent of myasthenia gravis in dogs and other animals. This prompted the author to pursue appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, resulting in a presumptive diagnosis of postsynaptic “congenital myasthenia gravis”, or CMS. \\n\\r\\nThe publication of the first case report led to collaboration with the German group of Steinlein and Sieb in order to identify the underlying mutation. Although the bovine CHRNE complementary DNA (cDNA) sequence had previously been described (Takai et al., 1985), its genomic sequence had not. The description of the genomic structure of bovCHRNE and the discovery of the mutation responsible for the disease, a 20 base pair deletion in exon 5 of the gene, is the subject of Chapter 3. \\n\\r\\nIn Chapter 4, the development and validation of a PCR screening test for the mutation is described. The chapter discusses the results of initial screening for the mutation, both amongst relatives of the then known carrier bulls and amongst unrelated animals, to obtain an initial estimate of the frequency of the mutation. Clinical findings from another affected calf are also described. \\n\\r\\nWider screening of the South African registered Brahman cattle population was then undertaken, in collaboration with the BCBSSA. The results of this screening to date are presented in Chapter 5. A more precise estimate of the mutation frequency in the population, and its change over time, is thus obtained. Chapter 5 also addresses the question of whether there is any selective advantage associated with an animal being heterozygous for the mutation. In addition, pedigree analysis is carried out in order to identify ancestral carriers of the mutation and thus determine its origin in the South African population. \\n\\r\\nIn order to control a recessive disease-causing mutation such as CMS in a livestock population, it is necessary to know how the frequency is expected to change over time. In Chapter 6, a spreadsheet model is described that predicts the change in mutation frequency over time in a population, under certain assumptions. The model allows for fitness to vary between genotypes, between sexes and over time. It can thus be used to model mutation frequency where there is heterozygote advantage or disadvantage and/or when various control measures are implemented. \\n\\r\\nFinally, Chapter 7 contains a general discussion of what is currently known about CMS in Brahman cattle. The most important issues arising from each chapter are highlighted, and the implications of CMS for the Brahman breed in South Africa are discussed.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Proteins play a major role in biology by interacting with each other and with other biomolecules. The study of these interactions is of fundamental importance to understand cellular processes, and this could be a key towards understanding mechanisms of diseases and possible development of drugs. As a result, considerable attention is given to the study of protein interactions. As described in the introduction of this thesis (chapter 1), a key task is to unravel these interactions at atomic details. However, traditional structure determination methods (X-ray crystallography and NMR) encounter serious experimental difficulties in dealing with protein complexes. Therefore, complementary computational methods are needed. This thesis describes the modelling of biomolecular complexes by data-driven docking, a computational method that, based on the known structures of the constituents of a complex and any information about their interface, derives a model for the structure of the complex. Chapter 2 reviews several approaches towards the use of experimental information in docking and introduces the data-driven docking method HADDOCK which we used in all the modelling described in this thesis. Chapters 3 and 4 focus on the use of NMR information in data-driven docking. Chemical shift perturbation (CSP) data allow assessment of the interface in a complex. These data can be combined with Residual Dipolar Couplings (RDCs, chapter 3) or diffusion anisotropy data (chapter 4), which provide complementary orientational restraints. In chapter 3 this methodology is applied towards the determination of the solution structure of the ubiquitin dimer. In Chapter 5 we turn towards the docking methodology itself. We describe a novel solvated docking protocol that accounts for water in the docking process. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach and show that the docking results in general improve. Our protocol adds considerable information to existing docking approaches, since it allows to predict structural water molecules at an interface, which can be particularly valuable for drug design for example. The last two chapters are directed towards validation and application of our docking methodology. Chapter 6 describes the results of our participation to CAPRI (Critical Assessment of PRedicted Interactions). In CAPRI, participants must make blind predictions of the structure of a complex within a limited time; these are then compared by independent assessors to the yet unpublished experimental structure. Our participation to CAPRI was quite successful, and our overall performance places us in the top of the field. In the final chapter, HADDOCK is applied to the study of complexes along the cytochrome c oxidase copper-delivery pathway. The correct assembly of cytochrome c oxidase (which generates the proton gradient that drives synthesis of ATP, the major biological energy carrier) depends on this pathway. So far, structural details about interactions between the proteins involved in this pathway (cox17, sco1, cox2 and cox11) are unknown. Here, models for the structures of the human complexes cox17-sco1, sco1-cox2, cox17-cox11 and cox11-cox11 were generated. These models shed light on the path that copper travels during its way towards cytochrome c oxidase and provide new starting points for experimental studies.'],\n",

       "  'Description': [\"A linear accelerator (linac) is the most commonly used device for treatment of patients with cancer in external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). The Linac delivers a high-energy ionizing radiation (photons or electrons) to the region of the patient's tumor. The absorption of radiation in the treated area damages the diseased cells. To minimize irradiation of healthy tissue beams should be shaped. Commonly, this is achieved by using a multi-leaf collimator (MLC). The motivation for this work was given by the fact that a conventional Linac/MLC, currently available on the market, was designed for conformal radiotherapy, but is nowadays also used for intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). In this thesis the first goal was to understand and to quantify the impact of Linac/MLC design parameters on IMRT treatment plans. The investigated parameters were: leaf width of the MLC, leaf transmission related to the thickness of the leaves, and penumbra related primarily to the source size. For this purpose, various head and neck IMRT plans were evaluated using the Plato and Pinnacle treatment planning systems. Lead by those findings, and a desire to obtain a collimator which could deliver large field size with high resolution field shaping, we present an alternative design of a multi-leaf collimator, called a six-bank MLC. The MLC system consists of three layers of two opposing leaf banks. The layers are rotated 60 degrees relative to each other. The leaves in each bank have a standard width of 1 cm projected at the isocentre. This is a novelty compared to the existing systems which can achieve either large field size with low resolution field shaping, or small field size with high resolution field shaping. For the six-bank MLC which would function as a multi-purpose collimator, suitable for all types of treatments, two methods for delivering IMRT were developed. In a low-resolution mode similar segments can be delivered as with a conventional two-bank MLC with a leaf width of 1 cm. The performance in high-resolution mode is comparable to that of a mini-MLC, but a trade-off had to be made between accuracy and number of segments. Finally, an analytical model of the optimal MLC leaves design was made, and was used to find the optimal leaf design parameters for a six-bank MLC. In conclusion, Linac/MLC design is of great importance for IMRT treatment of patients. By further improvement of image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) and application of on-line position verification on a daily basis, additional reduction of margins will be possible. This would lead to a great benefit enhancement of a six-bank MLC over the conventional MLCs.\"],\n",

       "  'Description': [\"The primary focus of this thesis is the two kinases PKA and PKG, cAMP and cGMP dependent protein kinase respectively. PKA and PKG are studied both at structure/function level as well as at the level of interaction with other proteins in tissue. Our primary methods are all based on mass spectrometry. First, a brief overview of molecular signaling events involved in the function of the cardiovascular system, especially those involving the cyclic nucleotides cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate) and cGMP (cyclic guanosine monophosphate) is given. Besides the specific functions of the two kinases PKG and PKA, other proteins involved in cyclic nucleotide signaling, like phosphodiesterases, cyclic nucleotide activated ion channels and Epac are briefly discussed. Special attention is given to compartmentalized signaling events that involve scaffolding proteins, for PKA and PKG designated as AKAPs and GKAPs. The structure function relationships in PKA and PKG are also described. Specifically, mass spectrometric techniques that were used in structure/function studies are described in somewhat more detail. The structure function relationships of PKG is the focus of chapter 2 and 3. Chapter 2 studies this by intrinsic fluorescence stability measurements and limited proteolysis to show that the stability of PKG is mediated by a single amino acid that acts as a stability switch. In chapter 3, a lysine surface labeling technique was developed and tested on the E. Coli Colicin E9-Im9 protein complex. Then it was applied to elucidate the differential solvent exposure of PKG's different domains upon cGMP binding, which eventually proved more challenging than expected. This is either due to the fact that no lysines are in direct proximity of the affected sites, or that affected sites all reside in the uncovered 40% of the protein sequence. It is also possible that the basal kinase activation of PKG takes place on a short timescale, thereby eliminating differences. The next two chapters of this thesis focus on the use and development of chemical proteomic approaches in the search for (novel) PKA AKAP signaling complexes involved in heart function. Chapter 4 describes the initial development of a chemical proteomics method to selectively enrich PKA/AKAP, and PKG, signaling protein complexes from rat ventricular tissue by using immobilized cAMP or cGMP. Among the proteins enriched for, several different AKAPs not earlier described in heart tissue were observed. Most interesting was the observation that the protein SKIP (Sphingosine Kinase type 1 Interacting Protein), earlier described as an anchor for sphingosine kinase-1, could be assigned as a novel AKAP. Chapter 5 continues with the application of the cyclic nucleotide pull down protocol. A more detailed relative quantification procedure is described as well to more reliably allocating proteins to a specific eluting fraction. Attention is focused on the discovery of a novel splice isoform of AKAP2: PALM2-AKAP2, as well as on the observed differential phosphorylation patterns of PKA regulatory subunit type Iα. Finally, all results are placed into perspective in a concluding summary and outlook.\"],\n",

First a new type of filter is proposed which is capable of enhancing vascular structures while suppressing noise in the remainder of the image. This filter is based on a controlled smoothing process and results in a so-called scale space representation of the vascular structures. This representation can be used as preprocessing step for other vascular image processing techniques, such as vessel axis tracking and vessel segmentation. Second, a new method is proposed to track the central vessel axis in vessels with known topology. The method utilizes surface evolution which is typically applied to object segmentation. In our approach surface evolution is extended by repeatedly estimating and constraining the current vessel axis. This way, vessel information is gathered while the vessel axis tracking method proceeds along the vessel. Finally, an automated method is proposed for segmentation of the complete intracranial arterial vasculature. The methods are applied to, and evaluated on 3D head and neck Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) data sets.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['In the literature on questionnaire design and survey methodology, pre-testing is mentioned as a way to evaluate questionnaires (i.e. investigate whether they work as intended) and control for measurement errors (i.e. assess data quality). As the American Statistical Association puts it (ASA, 1999, p. 11): “The questionnaire designer must understand the need to pretest, pretest, and then pretest some more.” Clark and Schober (1992, p. 29) indicate why this need to pre-test: “Surveyors cannot possibly write perfect questions, self-evident to each respondent, that never need clarification. And because they cannot, the answers will often be surprising.” \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this Ph.D. thesis I have tried to systematically describe my experiences with pre-test research at the Questionnaire Laboratory at Statistics Netherlands, a cognitive laboratory which started its work in 1992. This text is not aimed at a theoretical discussion of cognitive laboratory methods, but focuses on the application of these methods: setting-up and carrying-out pre-test research, analysing the data and presentation of the results. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe thesis starts with an introduction of cognitive laboratory research, including the history of the CASM (Cognitive Aspects of Survey Methodology) movement and the history of the Questionnaire Laboratory at Statistics Netherlands. The next two chapters address aspects of computer-assisted interviewing. Since at Statistics Netherlands most social-survey questionnaires are computerised, this sets the conditions for pre-test research at the Questionnaire Laboratory. Chapter 2 discusses computer-assisted interviewing in general; chapter 3 addresses the effects of computer-assisted interviewing on data quality. These three chapters are introductory to the chapters that follow, the actual core of the thesis, in which the application of cognitive laboratory methods, including several case studies, are discussed. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe methods used at the Questionnaire Laboratory at Statistics Netherlands are discussed in chapters 4 and 5. Chapter 4 presents an overview of pre-test methods. Expert appraisal, focus groups, in-depth interviewing (including follow-up probing, meaning-oriented probing, paraphrasing, targeted test questions, and vignettes), and behavioural coding are discussed from a practical point of view, i.e. how they are applied in the Questionnaire Laboratory. Computer-Assisted Qualitative Interviewing (CAQI) is discussed in chapter 5. The CAQI method has been developed at the Questionnaire Laboratory to pre-test computerised questionnaires. With CAQI a pre-test protocol is integrated in a computerised questionnaire to be tested.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next four chapters present case studies of cognitive research in which the methods addressed in the chapter 4 and 5 have been applied. These chapters discuss the design and the results (i.e. identified problems in the questionnaire and recommendations for improvement) of these studies. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 10 concludes this thesis with a summary. A number of identified problems in the investigated questionnaires are: vague or unclear wording, complex syntax, long question, double-barrelled question, conflict with previous question(s), question asks for specific information that is not available by heart, difficult to come to an answer because of complex calculation, overlapping or missing response items. In the conclusion, the identified problems are related to design errors in the questionnaire. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nReferences\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nASA, 1999, Designing a Questionnaire.

       "  'Title': ['Dynamics of Endovascular Eneurysm Repair'],\n",
       "  'Description': [\"Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) was in 1996 started at the St. Antonius Hospital, Nieuwegein, The Netherlands, with use of the AneuRx stent-graft system (Medtronic AVE, Santa Rosa, CA, USA). All data were captured prospectively in a vascular database. In Chapter 2 a general overview of recent literature of EVAR is evaluated. Chapter 3 contains mid-term single-center results with the AneuRx device in the first 77 patients with a minimum follow-up of 12 months. In Chapter 4, the application of EVAR to repair paraanastomotic aneurysms (PAA's) is described. In our series of 14 patients, PAA's were successfully excluded with EVAR without perioperative mortality and with morbidity in one patient. Median follow-up was 12 months. In patients who were treated with bifurcated stent-grafts, no conversions were performed, and a secondary intervention was necessary in one patient. Reconstructions of proximal aortic anastomotic aneurysms with endovascular tube grafts were not durable, however. In Chapter 5, stent-graft explantation is discussed. In our series of 355 patients treated with stent-grafts, late conversion rate was 3.1%. Mortality rate for acute conversions was 50%. Of the six patients who needed elective conversion, mortality rate was 0% and morbidity rate was 67%; These results advocate timely explantation if EVAR-related problems occur cannot be solved with endovascular techniques. Chapter 6 focuses on the long-term single-center results with the AneuRx device which was used in 212 patients. Perioperative mortality rate was 2.4 %. Freedom from secondary interventions was 48% at 9 years. The aneurysm-related death rate was relatively small, with an annual risk of about 1%. Most secondary interventions were needed for fixation-related problems in the proximal aortic anchoring zone. Therefor we decided to start dynamic studies on the area of the proximal aortic neck by means of dynamic magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). Chapter 7 describes a study on dynamics of the proximal anchoring zone studied with dynamic MRA before and after EVAR in 11 patients. Preoperatively, mean diameter changes at each level were about 8%. These diameter changes differed between patients and even within each patient they varied over the studied axes. Pulsatility of the aneurysm neck appeared not to be influenced by stent-graft placement. In Chapter 8, wall stiffness of the aneurysm neck and the aneurysm sac were studied with dynamic MRA, before and after stent-graft placement in 11 patients. We measured an increased stiffness at the level of the aneurysm sac after EVAR Neither EVAR nor endoleaks resulted in changes of stiffness within the aneurysm neck. Stent-graft design did influence compliance at the level of the neck. Conclusion This thesis has shown acceptable results during mid-term and long-term follow-up for patients with severe comorbidities. Proximal fixation of the stent-graft was identified as the Achilles' heel of EVAR and therefore should be of major interest for further investigation and improvement. We presented new information on dynamic features of the aneurysm neck before and after stent-graft placement. This information gains insight into a whole new area for further studies and will have its effects on inclusion criteria and stent-graft designs.\"],\n",

       "  'Title': ['PK-PD Modeling of Fluoroquinolones and ABC Transporters in Poultry'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['In the first part of this thesis advance pharmacokinetic models, based on an integration of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data for selected fluotoquinolones, are presented. The comparative investigations with danofloxacin mesylate and marbofloxacin indicated that with both fluoroquinolones a concentration-dependent killing of E. coli O78/K80 can be achieved in vitro, but that in vivo danofloxacin mesylate shows lower values for the AUC24/MIC ratio as compared to marbofloxacin. This PK-PD approach allows a direct comparison of different antibiotics and can serve as guidance in the design of dosage regimens for forthcoming clinical trails. In the interpretation of these data it should be considered, that the calculation of the optimal dose in this model is based on drug plasma levels, and not on tissue concentrations. The latter determine, however, the concentration at the site of infection in most cases. Moreover, physiological changes during an infection are incompletely reflected in these commonly used models. As the first step towards a refinement of these kinetic analyses, a pilot study with implanted tissue chambers was conducted. This study showed that subcutaneous tissue cages could be used in poultry as well. Implanted cages could be infected with test organisms that produce a local inflammatory reaction, without affecting the wellbeing of the animal significantly. This model offers broad possibilities to study the kinetics and typical pharmacodynamic characteristics of antimicrobials and other pharmaceuticals under the conditions of an inflammatory reaction in the living animal. To refine the limited information than can be obtained from the plasma levels of a drug, the factors involved in absorption and tissue distribution of a given drug or toxin should be known. Transport proteins, particularly by the so-called ABC proteins, which are able to expel various substances out of the cell, determine often the tissue distribution. The strategic localization of these proteins at mucosal surfaces such as the intestinal mucosa, or the pulmonary alveolar surfaces, in excretory organs, such as liver and kidneys, as well as at tissue barriers (such as the blood brain barrier) indicate the eminent role in absorption, distribution and excretion of drugs and toxins. At present, the knowledge about their tissue distribution and functions in poultry is very limited. Hence the expression of MDR1, MRP2 and BCRP, the three major transporters involved in drug transport across biological membranes in mammals, were investigated by quantitative PCR in chickens and in turkeys. The result was an expression map that served all forthcoming experiments. It could be shown that the level of expression and functional activity could be modulated by fluoroquinolones, although the fluoroquinolones that had been used for the kinetic studies did not significantly alter the activity of for example P-gp. Moreover, treatment of animals, experimentally infected with E. coli, with either fluoroquinolone showed that bacterial cure is accompanied by a rapid restoration of physiological P-gp expression (without significant effect on MRP2 expression). This restoration increases the functionality of the intestinal barrier as well as the function of other tissue barriers and is an essential parameter in the prediction of the therapeutic outcome of antibiotics.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) of transmembrane proteins comprises a large superfamily of efflux transporters with diverse physiological functions. Three members, ABCB1, ABCC2 and ABCG2, are predominantly expressed at the luminal membranes of excretory organs like the liver and the kidneys, as well as at biological barriers, as for example the intestinal barrier and the blood-brain barrier. It has been postulated that not only many drugs but also various toxins are substrates for these transporters, which in turn represent an innate defence mechanism of the organism against many undesirable food/feed components as well as toxins. In the first part of the thesis, three different substances were studied in a defined cell culture model comprising Caco-2 cells that resemble the intestinal barrier and allow the prediction of drug/toxin absorption and passage into barrier-protected tissues. Three compounds, that are relevant to pigs were selected: the antibiotic oxytetracycline was chosen due to its long-standing and common use in pig health care, despite its low oral bioavailability. In contrast, danofloxacin, a modern fluoroquinolone was selected as it gains importance in the therapy of infectious diseases in pigs. The third compound, the mycotoxin ochratoxin A, was included in these tests as it is known that pigs are the most sensitive animal species, and hence insight into the organ distribution of the toxin might contribute to the understanding of this species-specific sensitivity. All three compounds were found to be substrates for one or more ABC transporters and hence these findings confirmed that more detailed information on the tissue distribution of ABC transporters, particularly ABCB1, ABCC2 and ABCG2 in pigs, is needed. Subsequently the expression of P-gp (ABCB1), MRP2 (ABCC2) and BCRP (ABCG2) was investigated by immunohistochemistry and quantitative RT- PCR analysis in a wide range of porcine tissues. A comparison of these findings with investigations in other species indicated a lower level of expression of P-gp in porcine kidneys and BCRP in porcine liver, as compared to human and rodent data. These findings suggest that the differences in the kinetics of the mentioned therapeutics and the mycotoxin are partly attributable to species-differences at the level of membrane transporters. Sequence analysis of porcine transporters demonstrated a high degree of homology with the corresponding human ABC proteins, which was higher than that for mice and rats. These findings confirm the good correlation between the kinetic data obtained from humans and pigs, and suggest that bioassays in pigs or with pig tissues may serve as an elegant model for kinetic studies with drugs and toxins affecting humans. Finally, an easy and rapid model, based on isolated porcine lymphocytes is presented, that allows to predict directly the function of P-gp. These functional studies quantify P-gp dependent Rhodamin 123 transport and allow to identify not only substrates but also inhibitors of P-gp. The latter might be involved in drug-drug interactions and interactions between drugs, toxins and dietary components. In conclusion, the presented results provide for the first time detailed insight into the levels of expression and function of ABC transporters in pigs.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['The war within : Neurobiological alterations in posttraumatic stress disorder'],\n",
       "  'Description': [\"For a large number of veterans, war does not end after they are removed from a combat zone. Traumatic stress affects nearly all veterans, but while the majority of veterans learn to live with their experiences, for some veterans traumatic stress seethes inside. In this dissertation posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in Dutch veterans was examined using different neuroimaging techniques and neuropsychological assessment. In the first two chapters, a review of the literature is reported, in which studies on hippocampal volumetry were examined. From this database the methodology of all original manual tracing protocols of the hippocampus were studied, and discussed in relation to optimizing determination of hippocampal volume. In addition, hippocampal volumetric findings in neuropsychiatric disorders were reported, and possible mechanisms of hippocampal volume loss were discussed. Advances in computational image analysis provide new opportunities to use semi-automatic techniques to determine cortical thickness. Veterans with and without PTSD, were examined with structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and individual cortical thickness maps were calculated. Veterans with PTSD revealed reduced cortical thickness in the bilateral frontal gyri, and the left superior temporal gyrus. Differences in the benzodiazepine-GABAA receptor complex in Dutch veterans with and without deployment-related PTSD were examined using [11C]-flumazenil and PET. Region of interest (ROI) analysis using both template-based and manual ROIs revealed significantly reduced [11C]-flumazenil binding in PTSD subjects throughout the cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus. Although clinical studies have described altered pain experience in patients with PTSD, few empirical studies have examined pain processing in PTSD in detail. The neural correlates of pain processing in Dutch veterans with deployment-related PTSD and control veterans were examined with fMRI. Veterans with PTSD revealed increased activation in the left hippocampus, and decreased activation in the bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, and the right amygdala during stimulation with a fixed temperature compared to controls. The witnessed neural activation pattern is proposed to be related to altered pain processing in patients with PTSD. In another fMRI study, neural correlates of associative learning and memory in veterans with PTSD and control veterans were assessed. Veterans with PTSD revealed underactivation of the frontal cortex, and overactivation of the temporal cortex during encoding of word-pairs compared to control veterans without PTSD. Retrieval of the word-pairs resulted in underactivation of right frontal cortex, bilateral middle temporal gyri, and the left parahippocampal gyrus in veterans with PTSD. Finally, the results of a neuropsychological study on memory performance in PTSD and its relation to social and occupational functioning were reported. Veterans with PTSD had similar total IQ scores compared to veterans without PTSD, but displayed deficits of figural and logical memory. Veterans with PTSD also performed significantly lower on measures of learning and immediate and delayed verbal memory. Memory performance accurately predicted current social and occupational functioning. These neurobiological alterations witnessed in veterans with PTSD show that the problems experienced by them are not just 'figments of the imagination' but very real neurobiological consequences of traumatic stress. It is this neurobiological 'war within' that we should learn to wage and win.\"],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Multislice CT of the symptomatic carotid artery'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['In the Netherlands about 40.000 patients yearly suffer from stroke or TIA. In 20-30% of these cases a stenosis in the carotid artery is found. This stenosis is caused by atherosclerotic plaque formation. Symptoms are thought to be the result of cerebral embolism by formation of thrombi at the plaque and the luminal obstruction which causes reduced blood flow to the brain. Endarterectomy has proven beneficial in the prevention of stroke by removal of this stenosis, but carries a risk for complications. However, a new treatment option has been proposed: carotid artery stenting. Although this is a very promising less-invasive treatment, it has not yet proven to be as effective as surgery. Therefore the ICSS trial has been started. We studied the participating patients of the ICSS using a new technique; the multislice CT scanner.\\n\\r\\nThe possibilities of the multislice CT for neurovascular applications are explained. \\n\\r\\nWe studied how we could improve image quality in combination with radiation dose reduction. It turned out that the use of lower kilovoltage settings can improve image quality at lower total patient dose.\\n\\r\\nWe compared the ICSS population to 100 patients without cerebrovascular disease, and assessed the presence and size of the segments of the circle of Willis both in patients and controls. In ICSS patients we found significantly more absent or hypoplastic segments in the anterior part of the circle. This suggests that incompleteness of the circle may be a risk factor for the development of symptoms in case of carotid stenosis by preventing collateral supply.\\n\\r\\nNext, we compared various techniques to measure the degree of stenosis using MSCT and compared this to DSA as standard of reference. The use of visual estimation outperformed the other techniques for all four observers and resulted in comparable inter-observer variability as repeated DSA measurements.\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo evaluate the potentials of CT perfusion, first the reproducibility of CT perfusion measurements was determined. We concluded that MTT is the most reproducible CTP parameter in patients with unilateral symptomatic CAS. Measurement variability in CBV and CBF can be improved if CTP ratios instead of CTP values are used. \\n\\r\\nLast, we determined whether pre-treatment CT perfusion analysis in patients with unilateral symptomatic carotid artery stenosis can be used to distinguish between groups of patients that will respond differently to carotid revascularization, in terms of changes in cerebral perfusion.\\r\\nBased on the previous study we used relative MTT defined as difference in MTT between two hemispheres, to distinguish three groups of patients. Sixteen patients (44%) came in group 1, 12 patients (33%) in group 2, and in eight patients (22%) in group 3. Only patients with the largest MTT difference (group 3) showed significant improvement of CBF, CBV and MTT. This indicates that the relative MTT before treatment may be used as parameter that can predict hemodynamic response to treatment. The results imply that knowledge of perfusion values may not only increase our insight in the hemodynamics, but in future also may help to select patients that benefit most from treatment.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The main purpose of the studies outlined in this thesis was to gain empirical\\r\\nepidemiological and therapeutic knowledge of some common infectious diseases in\\r\\nNicaragua. So far, relatively little was known about the incidence, etiology,\\r\\nmanagement and antibiotic resistance patterns of common infections. Of importance\\r\\nis to note that because of a lack of knowledge, currently many patients are\\r\\nunnecessarily treated with antibiotics for a presumed infection or the choice for the\\r\\nspecific drug is untargeted.

       "  'Title': ['Antibiotic Resistance in Intensive Care Units: Dynamics of Colonization'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['The dynamics of colonization of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in hospital settings are complex and depend on bacteria and healthcare worker related characteristics. Many factors influence colonization and in addition these factors interact with each other as well. Knowledge of local resistance epidemiology such as dominant colonization route (endogenous and cross-transmission), antibiotic use, contact rates, cohorting of healthcare workers (extent one-to-one care) and adherence to hand hygiene is important in the development of control strategies. In intervention studies these factors need to be carefully measured before and after implementation of a certain strategy. In addition, only one strategy should be implemented at a time so that the effect of this specific strategy can be evaluated. So far, most intervention studies did not or only partially comply with the above, which makes conclusions drawn from these studies difficult to interpret (chapter 1). During a ten-week period in an intensive care unit at Cook County Hospitals Chicago, microbiological surveillance and bacterial genotyping, without reporting results and subsequent isolation procedures, showed that the majority of colonizations with methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA and MRSA) were imported into the ICU and were not the result of cross-transmission. When culture results would have been reported and patients isolated subsequently, this probably would have led to the false conclusion that this strategy was indeed succesful in the prevention of cross-transmission in this unit (chapter 2). Measurement of contact rates, cohorting and adherence to hand hygiene showed that the magnitude of these factors varies for different healthcare workers. The risk of bacterial transmission for physicians and nurses was calculated using these measurements and it showed that physicians had a 1.6 times higher risk to transmit bacteria than nurses in that particular intensive care unit (chapter 3). The dominant colonization route can be determined by microbiological surveillance and bacterial genotyping. The latter is time-consuming, labour-intensive and costly. Mathematical modeling seems a promising tool to determine colonization routes based on minimal clinical and surveillance data (chapter 5). Although time-consuming and costly, combining different molecular typing techniques and epidemiological linkage of patients is relevant to gain insight in resistance epidemiology because it provides more detail about the origin of resistance determinants and underlying dynamics (chapter 4). A study to determine colonization dynamics of cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae and to evaluate the effects of a change in antibiotic prescription (cycling vs restriction policy) was performed. Colonization was predominantly acquired endogenously with the use of amoxicillin-clavulanate as the only modifyable risk factor. A stepwise reduction in the use of amoxicillin-clavulanate, at the cost of quinolone use, failed to reduce acquisition rates of cephalosporin-resitant Enterobacteriaceae in this setting. Resistance to quinolones, however, increased during this period (chapter 8). Still, more well-designed studies are needed to gather knowledge about which strategies to use in the control of antibiotic resistance.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Functional MRI studies in human Ecstasy and cannabis users'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Cannabis and ecstasy are among the most widely used illicit drugs in the world. However, there are substantial concerns about their neurotoxic potential for brain and brain function. Despite previous research, some crucial questions regarding the causality, course and clinical relevance have remained unanswered, mainly because of methodological limitations. These limitations include the use of cross-sectional and retrospective designs with lack of baseline data and inadequate control of potential confounders, such as poly-substance use in ecstasy users. This thesis, as part of the larger Netherlands XTC Toxicity (NeXT) study, presents four functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies designed to overcome the limitations of previous studies and thus makes a significant contribution to the remaining questions concerning the potential neurotoxicity of ecstasy and its most commonly used co-drug cannabis. The studies presented in this thesis focused entirely on ecstasy or cannabis-induced functional consequences, in terms of sustained effects on human brain function in three cognitive domains, i.e. working memory, selective attention and episodic associative memory. In order to overcome the lack of baseline data, a prospective cohort study was performed in novice ecstasy users and persistent ecstasy-naive controls. 25 Novice users were examined before and after an episode of first ecstasy use. They were compared with 24 controls, also measured twice, and matched for gender, verbal IQ and cannabis use with the novice users. To deal with the potential confounding of poly-drug use in experienced ecstasy users, a large stratified sample with substantial variation in the amount and type of drug used was carefully composed, instead of a random recruitment among heavy ecstasy users. Subsequently, the effects of ecstasy and other drugs such as amphetamine, cocaine and cannabis could be separated with multiple regression analyses. In addition, the selective effects of frequent cannabis use were investigated in two cross-sectional fMRI studies where we compared task performance and related brain activity during working memory, attention and associative memory between groups of frequent cannabis users and cannabis-naive controls. Regarding the specific effects of ecstasy in the context of poly-substance use the results indicated that drug use was associated with reduced performance and altered brain activity for associative memory, but had little effect on working memory and attention. Importantly, memory performance was affected by amphetamine more than by ecstasy. Both drugs affected brain activity, but these effects were consistently in opposite direction, indicating separate mechanisms are at play. These findings suggest that previously reported effects of ecstasy on memory and memory-related brain function might be (partly) attributable to concomitant use of amphetamine rather than the use of ecstasy. Concerning the prospective cohort study in incident users the results showed no firm evidence for sustained effects of a low dose of ecstasy (median number of pills: 1.5) on cognitive brain function. With regard to cannabis, the results failed to show cognitive deficits or changes in cognitive brain function. It should be noted, however, that it can not be excluded that other assessment techniques measuring similar or different aspects of the brain and brain functioning could detect sustained changes in the brain or in brain functioning. Given the fact that the NeXT study is still in progress and entails an interconnected set of studies including other neuroimaging and neuropsychological assessments, a final conclusion regarding the neurotoxicity of ecstasy and cannabis is yet to be drawn.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Term breech delivery in The Netherlands'],\n",
       "  'Description': [\"The management of the term breech delivery has been a subject of discussion for many years. Only a few randomized trials had been performed on outcome in relation to the mode of delivery in case of breech position. In october 2000 the results of the Term Breech Trial (TBT) were published, in which women with a term fetus in breech were randomly assigned for planned caesarean section (CS) or planned vaginal delivery. The results showed a significantly lower perinatal mortality and morbidity after planned CS. Until 2000 the CS rate in The Netherlands among term breech was 50%, of which half were planned and half were emergency CS's after vaginal onset of labour. Following the publication of the results of the TBT this rate increased in two months from 50% to 80% and remained stable thereafter. In this thesis several studies on perinatal outcome after planned CS as compared to planned vaginal delivery of the term breech in The Netherlands are described. Results of an analysis of the five-year period prior to the TBT on perinatal outcome of more than 33,000 term infants, using data from the Dutch Obstetric Registry (LVR-2), showed similar results as the TBT: a trial of labour resulted in a seven-fold increase in low Apgar score, a three-fold increase in birth trauma and a two-fold increase in perinatal mortality, compared to planned CS. The fast and large change in CS rate had it's effect on perinatal outcome. Analysis on outcome of more than 35,000 term breech infants, performed on the 33-months period prior to and the 25-months period after the TBT, showed that the change in policy had resulted in an improved perinatal outcome. Mortality decreased from 0.35% to 0.18%, low five-minute Apgar (‹ 7) score from 2.4% to 1.1% and birth trauma from 0.29% to 0.08%. Analysis of the years after the TBT, using linked data from the Dutch Obstetric and Neonatal Registry enabled us to study perinatal outcome in more detail. Even with a decline of vaginal deliveries of term breech infants after the TBT, perinatal outcome among more than 11,000 term infants remained worse after a planned vaginal delivery, with an excess of perinatal mortality / morbidity of more than 1%, as compared to planned CS. To investigate which factors contributed to the extraordinary fast and large change in policy concerning term breech delivery, a questionnaire survey was held among all 100 Dutch obstetric departments. Patient influence seemed to be the most important factor for the change in medical practice in case of term breech. Analysis on gender differences revealed that from 31 weeks onwards there are significantly more girls in breech position. Perinatal outcome is worse for boys, with higher mortality and morbidity, irrespective of the mode of delivery. Breech position clearly appears to be associated with a significantly higher prevalence of congenital malformations than vertex postion and in both positions a male excess is found regarding almost all congenital malformations.\"],\n",

L-arginine and BH4 are both essential factors for adequate eNOS function. Reduced levels of the substrate or cofactor lead to the formation of superoxide by eNOS, a process referred to as eNOS uncoupling. In all studies described here, a microvascular endothelial cell line (bEnd.3) is used. These cells express high levels of eNOS but lack neuronal or inducible NOS. In addition, bEnd.3 cells produce relatively large amounts of NO, which facilitates the detection of subtle differences in NO production as a consequence of treatment with agonists or antagonists. Despite the high concentrations of NO produced by bEnd.3 cells, determining the exact NO concentration is a chalenge. In chapter 3, we describe that electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) is an excellent tool to quantify the amount of NO produced by stimulated and unstimulated bEnd.3 cells. In chapter 4 it is shown that localisation of eNOS at cell-cell contact site proofs to be essential for eNOS activity. In contrast to earlier reports, we show in chapter 5 that addition of L-arginine leads to an increase in eNOS uncoupling. Addition of BH4 prevents eNOS uncoupling. In chapter 6 and 7 the effects of elevated levels of free fatty acids and hypoalbuminaemia, respectively, on eNOS activity, NO production and down-stream effectors are discussed. In the presence of high concentrations of free fatty acids, eNOS activity is decreased and mitochondrial ROS production is increased. Mitochondrial-derived ROS can induce BH4 oxidation, resulting in a shortage of the cofactor and subsequent eNOS uncoupling. Hypoalbuminemia, which is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, results in increased eNOS activity and NO production in vitro. Endothelium-independent relaxation was markedly blunted in analbuminemic rats, while endothelium-dependent dilatation was slightly, but significantly, increased. This implies that in vivo hypoalbuminemia reduces vascular NO sensitivity. We show that low albumin as such seems to enhance, rather than diminish, eNOS-mediated endothelial NO production. In chapter 8, we show a marked increase in NO production under anoxic conditions, even though the normal arginine pathway of NO formation is blocked due to absence of oxygen. The anoxic release of NO is mediated by eNOS. This phenomenon is attributed to anoxic reduction of intracellular nitrite by eNOS. Its magnitude and duration suggests that nitrite reductase activity of eNOS is relevant for fast NO delivery in hypoxic vascular tissues. In chapter 9, the results presented in the previous chapters are discussed in a broader context. The importance of eNOS and its possible therapeutic benefits in the struggle against endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular disease are discussed.'],\n",

       "  'Description': [\"A 2-year cohort of 236 preterm-born infants (gestational age < 32 weeks and/or birth weight < 1500 grams), born between March 1, 1991 and March 1, 1993 and admitted to the NICU of the Wilhelmina Children's Hospital, was evaluated at school age. This cohort represented 83.4% of the surviving population of this time period. A normal neonatal cranial ultrasound excluded the occurrence of major abnormalities on later MRI in 99% of cases. Those with a normal or mildly abnormal cranial ultrasound had an approximately 50% chance of being in the corresponding MRI group. Over 70% of the children with a severely abnormal cranial ultrasound had major abnormalities on later MRI. MRI findings correlated better with outcome than ultrasound, although statistically significant, these differences were clinically not relevant. The mean total cross-sectional corpus callosum (CC) area, measured at school age, was significantly smaller in preterm-born infants compared with their term-born controls The preterm children with cerebral palsy (CP) had significantly smaller mean corpus callosum areas compared with the preterms who did not develop CP. The preterms without CP also had significantly smaller body, posterior and total CC areas compared with term-born controls. There was a significant inverse association between the total impairment score (TIS) and the areas of the CC. Higher TIS (indicating poorer motor function) was strongly related to smaller total CC area. A larger CC was strongly related to better scores on the VMI test. In the second part of the thesis, the impact of neonatal hydrocortisone administration, to treat chronic lung disease in ventilator-dependent preterm-born infants, on long-term outcome was investigated. The most commonly used corticosteroid worldwide to treat these infants is dexamethasone, but the adverse side-effects on long-term development are alarming. The Wilhelmina Children's Hospital has always used the much milder steroid hydrocortisone. At a median age of 8.1 years, neurocognitive assessment included an IQ test, a Visual-Motor Integration test and a memory test (15-word recall). Motor performance was assessed with the Movement Assessment Battery for Children. A MRI of the brain was obtained and in the last 60 children, three-dimensional MRI with advanced image-processing and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the hippocampus were added to the protocol. Sixty-two hydrocortisone-treated preterm-born children were compared with 164 non-treated preterm-born children. Adjustments for gestational age, birth weight, gender, mechanical ventilation and small for gestational age was made. Adjusted mean IQ, VMI and memory test results were the same in the hydrocortisone and the non-steroid group. Motor function and incidence of CP in both groups was not different. Occurrence of brain lesions on MRI was identical for the two groups. Hydrocortisone-treated children had very similar volumes of gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid, compared with non-treated infants. The volumes and proton spectroscopy ratios of the hippocampus were not significantly different between the hydrocortisone group and the non-steroid group. There was no relation between NAA/(Cho+Cr) ratios and memory nor between NAA/(Cho+Cr) ratios and IQ. Neonatal hydrocortisone treatment for BPD had no long-term effects on neurodevelopment.\"],\n",

       "  'Description': ['We sought to determine how the Src Family Kinases, Fyn and Yes, are involved in early vertebrate development. Using morpholinos we knocked down Fyn and Yes and found that the resultant phenotype bore striking similarities to Wnt11 and Wnt5 mutant zebrafish. Further analysis proved that Fyn/Yes morphants have defective CE cell movements during gastrulation which required the small GTPase RhoA. However, Fyn and Yes are not linear components of the non-canonical Wnt pathway. Instead they appear to act in parallel converging on or upstream of RhoA. This led to the question what is upstream of Fyn and Yes? Previous research in Xenopus and the mouse has identified the C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) as a key regulator of vertebrate gastrulation. Csk phosphorylates the inhibitory tyrosine residue in the C-terminal tail of SFKs leading to inactivation. Using a morpholino’s, we knocked down Csk during early zebrafish development and found that disruption of Csk results in defective gastrulation cell movements. Importantly, we were able to rescue the Csk morphants by partially knocking down Fyn and Yes, indicating that Csk is directly upstream of these two SFKs. We next sought to determine what is upstream of Csk. The most promising candidate was Shp2, as Shp2 negatively regulates Csk by dephosphorylating the membrane bound adaptor protein PAG1. Csk is now no longer targeted to the plasma membrane and cannot inhibit membrane bound SFKs. We were able to demonstrate that Shp2 was necessary for CE cell movements during zebrafish gastrulation. These results are consistent with data from Xenopus and mouse. In addition, we show that Shp2 is upstream of Fyn and Yes by epigenetic analyses. Moreover, Shp2 knock down was rescued by active RhoA, placing Shp2 in a pathway parallel to non-canonical Wnt signalling. Our data, together with biochemical data, suggest a model which sees Shp2 negatively regulate Csk, the inhibitor of Fyn and Yes which in turn act upstream of RhoA in gastrulation cell movements. Because of Shp2’s involvement in early embryonic development we sought to determine whether the defects associated with human Noonan and LEOPARD syndrome (NS/LS) which are caused by activating and dominant negative mutations in Shp2, respectively, are also caused by defective gastrulation cell movements. Both NS and LS patients present with overlapping symptoms, including short stature, hypertelorism and heart defects. We noticed that some of these features were also present in Shp2 morphants. Here we show that zebrafish expressing either NS or LS mutated Shp2 develop defects that bear striking similarities to NS/LS patients, in that they are shorter, their eyes are spaced wider apart and they develop heart defects. Furthermore, we found that some of these defects were due to defective gastrulation. In conclusion, we identified a novel signalling pathway involving Shp2, Csk, Fyn/Yes and RhoA that acts in parallel to non-canonical Wnt signalling in gastrulation cell movements. Our data suggest that at least some of the symptoms in human NS and LS patients are caused by disruption of the Shp2-Csk-Fyn/Yes-RhoA signalling pathway and result from gastrulation cell movement defects.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Engelstalig abstract\\tCardiovascular diseases (CVD) were the main causes of mortality world wide in 2002 and are also projected to stay the main causes of mortality till 2030. In addition, depression and CVD are both predicted to become main contributors of disability in 2030. Not only are depression and CVD highly prevalent and main contributors of disability, many studies have also shown that they are more closely related and indicate that depression may be causally related to CVD. However, underlying mechanisms to explain this relation are not well understood. The aim of this thesis was to investigate whether depression was associated with CVD in elderly men, and in addition, to investigate the role of diet, lifestyle and health in this relationship. Data were used from the FINE (acronym for Finland, Italy and the Netherlands Elderly) Study and the Zutphen elderly Study, prospective population-based cohort studies on risk factors of CVD in elderly men. To determine depressive symptoms before the onset of CVD we excluded men with prevalent CVD and diabetes at baseline. Depressive symptoms increased the risk of cardiovascular mortality, a 5-point increase in depressive symptoms at baseline was associated with a 15% increased risk of cardiovascular mortality (hazard ratio (HR) 1.15 ; 95% CI 1.08-1.23), after adjusting for classical cardiovascular risk factors. This risk was stronger for mortality from stroke and heart failure in comparison with mortality from coronary heart disease and other degenerative heart diseases. There were no significant differences in hazard ratios between Finland, Italy and the Netherlands. To investigate whether a poor diet and unhealthy lifestly may explain the relation between depression and CVD, we assesed whether dietary intake of folate, vitamin B6, vitamin B12 and levels of serum homocysteine were associated with depressive symptoms. However intake of B-vitamin and homocysteine levels were not associated with depression and are therefore not likely to explain the relation between depression and CVD. In addition, a high intake of n-3 fatty acids was associated with a lower risk of depressive symptoms, but could not explain the increased risk of depressive symptoms on CVD mortality. The results indicated that depressed persons were less physically active, but physical inactivity also could not explain the relationship between depressive symptoms and CVD mortality. However, the combination of more depressive symptoms and low physical activity may lead to an extra increased risk of cardiovascular mortality. To investigate the role of health we assessed that high resting heart rate and a worse subjective health status, measured by self-rated health and self-reported disability in activities of daily living, were both also associated with more depressive symptoms at baseline as well as with a lower risk of CVD mortality. While indicators of autonomic dysfunction could not explain the relation between depression and CVD mortality, subjective health status did explain part of the relationship between depressive symptoms and cardiovascular mortality. However, a significant risk of depressive symptoms on cardiovascular mortality remained (HR 1.25; 95% CI 1.09-1.43). Finally, we discussed whether depression is a cause, consequence, or innocent bystander of CVD.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Recently the number of milking cows has increased substantially in the Dar es Salaam region due to an increasing demand for fresh milk in this densely populated urban centre.  It is estimated that there are 1,765 smallholder dairy herds with 8,233 improved dairy animals in and around the Dar es Salaam region. Urban and peri-urban smallholder dairying is viewed as an agricultural activity that provides a regular and stable income to the household and is considered to be a forerunner of further development. However, there are many potential constraints to smallholder dairy farming including difficulties in providing adequate feed and water, lack of dairying skills, and problems with marketing and poor animal health services. Mastitis occurring in clinical and subclinical forms is an important animal health constraint that affects both the amount and quality of milk produced by the smallholder dairy herds. Compared with other diseases, mastitis is ranked low in priorities by the national veterinary authority and consequently has received little attention in Tanzania. Extension efforts have therefore been focused on the treatment of clinical cases rather than tackling the disease from the control point of view. \\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe objective of the current study was to contribute to knowledge necessary to design herd specific mastitis control programmes in the urban based smallholder dairy herds. To achieve this, a combination of field (prevalence and longitudinal studies) and laboratory methods to mastitis epidemiology is used. The most important micro-organisms detected from quarter samples were (in ascending order of abundance) Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Candida albicans, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Of clinical significance is the steady increase in the incidence of clinical Candida albicans mastitis. The prevalence of Candida albicans has increased from \\r\\n≤\\r\\n1% in 1971 to ≥ \\r\\n17.0% in November 2002.The observed prevalence of clinical mastitis was ≤\\r\\n 5%, whereas the prevalence of sub-clinical mastitis, defined by positive (≥ 1) California mastitis test (CMT) score and bacteriologically positive culture was 90.7%. However, when the utility of the CMT to diagnose subclinical mastitis in the low yielding cows was evaluated, the prevalence of subclinical mastitis was found to be 57%. 100% of the smallholder producers were found to be aware of clinical mastitis, but only 5% of dairymen were aware of the presence of subclinical mastitis. Risk factor studies indicated that water scarcity, milking time hygiene, udder towel, residual calf suckling, barn cleanliness, the use of single udder-towel and dairy-labourers to be the most significant risk indicators for subclinical mastitis. It is concluded that the absence in Tanzania, of udder health programme consisting of regular visits by the veterinarian is the greatest risk indicator for mastitis which may be associated with a relative lack of awareness by the dairyperson of the importance of the principles of mastitis control.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Acceptable methods for large scale on-farm killing of poultry for disease control'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Abstract Worldwide large numbers of birds are killed to stop the spreading of contagious diseases like Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI). From animal welfare and epidemiological point of view animals are preferably killed on the premises and if possible in their housings. Furthermore, applied methods should be effective, have large capacity and animals should be unable to escape from it. In this thesis, animal welfare aspects, i.e. behavioural and physiological, and efficacy aspects of gas killing were assed for individual birds and groups of poultry. Observations during the 2003 HPAI outbreak in The Netherlands made it clear that whole house gassing with carbon dioxide is a method with high capacity and is relatively safe. Also, birds don’t have to be handled and transported to a killing device which is a major advantage for their welfare. Questions that raised about the suitability of carbon dioxide to kill ducks and turkeys were answered in experiments where ducks and turkeys were exposed to increasing carbon dioxide concentrations. In these experiments blood gas values, EEG’s and ECG’s confirmed that both species are equally sensitive to these increasing carbon dioxide concentrations. Furthermore, the results found in ducks and turkeys are comparable with results found in chickens and confirmed that all farmed poultry species can be killed by increasing the carbon dioxide concentration up to 40-45%. However, it is unmistakaeble that killing animals always interferes with their welfare. Before loss of consciousness all animals express heavy breathing (gasping) and headshaking during a period of 2 to 3 minutes. Convulsions, if they occur, are seen after loss of consciousness. Therefore, it can be concluded that the period of compromised animal welfare is not longer than 3 minutes. This period of compromised animal welfare however, is shorter than when animals are caught and handled when using mobile gas containers or mobile electrocution lines. Large scale killing of animals for disease control purpose meets a lot of societal resistance, especially when alternatives like vaccination are available. Furthermore, the visibility of the depopulation of poultry farms makes people aware that large numbers of birds are killed in our society every year. The moral attitude of people towards killing animals is strongly coloured by the reason why we kill animals; killing for food is more accepted than for disease control. However, we should realize that animal welfare is presumably more compromised in the normal slaughter process than when killed in their housings for disease control. Also, it is not realized that the non vaccination policy is an economical policy to protect our export position, something that benefits producers and consumers. In respect of animal welfare and of the moral attitude of man the non- vaccination policy should be reconsidered. However, we must realize that there will always remain situations that farms must be depopulated and therefore we should provide maximum effort in further developing acceptable killing methods.'],\n",

Subsequently, studies are described, demonstrating that patients with type 1 diabetes with normal and with impaired hypoglycaemia awareness, as well as patients with type 2 diabetes with normal hypoglycaemia awareness, have normal driving performance during euglycaemia, as well as during moderate hypoglycaemia, although in type 2 diabetic patients more effort is required to do so. However, it is also shown that the decision not to drive during hypoglycaemia is not always adequately made in type 1 patients with impaired hypoglycaemia awareness and by type 2 diabetic patients, particularly when using oral hypoglycaemic agents. The importance of good and tailored patient education is stressed. For methodological purposes, a practical algorithm to establish and maintain euglycaemia is studied. Moreover, the HemoCue glucose analyser is studied, and it is shown that it can be used interchangeably with the frequently used standard glucose oxidase method. Finally, the Dutch law is discussed, and discrepancies between the law and its execution by the Central Vehicle Licensing Agency (CBR) are noted. Recommendations are made for legislators, licensing authorities and medical advisors in the Netherlands and throughout the world to evaluate their legislature, and amend it according to current and emerging insights.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Despite sporadic attention to the issue, the therapeutic professions lack theoretical frameworks and empirical tools to examine the way in which power operates in the therapeutic encounter. This thesis attempts to address this situation, firstly by orienting to the ways in which power is hidden in therapeutic practice, which accounts to some extent for the limited and fragmentary attention given to the issue, and secondly by proposing theoretical and methodological tools to make power visible. In doing so, I develop a view of power based principally on the ideas of Michel Foucault. This approach to power is useful because it not only facilitates an understanding of local therapist-client dynamics, but also promotes investigation of therapy’s function in the overall sociocultural and political context. Four questions provide the cornerstones for this thesis: (1) What forces impact on participants in the therapeutic encounter? (2) How is power concealed in therapy? (3) How can it be made visible? (4) What is the relationship between therapeutic power and the operation of power at a societal-political level? Each of these questions is addressed in different ways in the studies presented, and attention is given to the empirical examination of actual therapist-client interactions drawn from a variety of therapeutic perspectives. The thesis argues for the fundamentally social and political nature of therapeutic practice. Following this series of empirical studies, some theoretical and methodological tools are proposed to enable future studies on power and therapy, a four stage sequence is hypothesised to understand how persons are shaped into the position of clienthood, and a model is offered to account for therapy’s place in power’s circulation through society.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['This thesis describes the development and application of a new model for the preclinical study of human T cells by transfer of huPBMCs into RAG2-/-γc-/- immunodeficient mice. The ultimate goal of treating patients with a malignancy is to eradicate the malignant cells, while keeping hold of damage to the healthy cells of the body. Therefore, the treatment has to be specific for only the malignant cells. Chemotherapy is often not specific enough, especially if high doses are needed to control the disease. A promising new treatment option is adoptive immunotherapy. Adoptive immunotherapy concerns the administration to a patient of immunogeneic cells (T cells) from a donor, that have the ability to track down and kill the malignant cells. To make the donor-derived T cells more specific for only malignant cells, a certain period in the laboratory (in vitro) is necessary for manipulation of the cells before administration to the patient. During this manipulation certain subsets of T cells can be selected, made more active or even genetically transformed. The results of the first clinical trials with adoptive immunotherapy are promising, but a lot of work still has to be done to improve the in vivo functionality of manipulated T cells. It is therefore necessary to test the functionality of manipulated human T cells in an animal model (in vivo) before application to patients. However, a preclinical model for in vivo evaluation of human T cells is not available. Initially, the huPBMC-RAG2-/-gc-/-model was developed as a new model for sensitive engraftment of human T cells. Engraftment levels of T cells were so high that at a relatively low dose of 15x106 human T cells all mice died of acute xenogeneic graft-versus-host disease. Histopathologically there were striking similarities of xenogeneic graft-versus-host disease in the mice and human graft-versus-host disease following allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Interestingly, when mice survived acute graft-versus-host disease, about 50% of mice developed chronic xenogeneic graft-versus-host disease. Further experiments demonstrate the huPBMC-RAG2-/-gc-/-model to be the first model that can be used for a quantitative evaluation of in vivo functionality of human T cells following in vitro manipulations. In mouse models, murine CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells have been shown to influence the extent of graft-versus-host disease. Therefore, manipulating regulatory T cells may be a new tool to improve outcome of allogeneic stem cell transplantation for patients with hematological malignancies. Results of additional experiments in this model for the first time show the effect of depletion and reinfusion of human regulatory T cells on xenogeneic graft-versus-host disease. In conclusion, this thesis describes the development and application of a new preclinical model for the in vivo study of human T cells. For a safe and effective application of adoptive immunotherapy, this model can be considered an important step forward towards clinical application.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['The Development of Personality and Problem Behaviour in Adolescence'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['This dissertation focuses on the development of personality and problem behaviour in adolescence. It has long been debated whether personality is stable or whether it changes over time. Personality could change due to the many changes that occur during adolescence, such as attending a new school, getting a job or having new friendships or romantic relationships. The personality of adolescents is known to be associated with several problem behaviours, such as depression, anxiety, aggression, and delinquency. However, it is not yet clear whether stability and change in personality have differential effects on the development of problem behaviour. Therefore, this dissertation attempts to unravel the associations between the development of personality and problem behaviour in adolescence. This dissertation elaborates on previous studies by focusing on data reported by adolescents and in using longitudinal data and employing advanced methodological techniques. The results are based on data collected as part of the CONflict And Management Of RElationships study (CONAMORE), which investigates the relationships of adolescents with their parents and peers as well as the adolescents’ emotional and behavioural states. CONAMORE is a longitudinal research project with a total of five measurement waves conducted annually. This design provides information about stability and change in the development of individuals over time. Since the data are gathered in (junior-)high schools, only adolescents from the general population participated. From the first wave onward, the sample was designed to contain two age cohorts, namely early and middle adolescents. The total longitudinal sample consists of 1,331 adolescents. In this dissertation, the data of the first four waves are presented. Four studies were conducted. The first study focused on examining whether personality moderated the associations between perceived parental rejection, depression and aggression. A major strength of this study was that combined personality type by gender groups were investigated, which had not been done before. We found that the co-occurrence of depression and aggression was highest in undercontroller boys and girls. The second study examined associations between personality type membership and anxiety over time. This is an important issue, since changes in anxiety appeared to co-occur with changes in personality types, indicating that personality change could lie at the heart of anxiety change. The third study examined whether personality moderated the longitudinal associations between depression and delinquency. The co-occurrence was found to be larger in stable resilients than in stable overcontrollers and undercontrollers, implying that the co-occurrence of (low levels of) depression and delinquency was larger in resilients than the co-occurrence of (higher levels of) depression and delinquency in overcontrollers and undercontrollers. This could be due to differences in amount of risk factors in these personality types. The fourth study focused on examining the longitudinal associations between the Big Five and the problem behaviours aggression and anxiety. One of its strengths was the use of a full recursive design, which was the first of its kind in this regard. We found no differences in the hierarchical superiority between personality and problem behaviour.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['In search for variables that determine outcome in patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy who undergo epilepsy surgery, we identified specific combinations of clinical neurophysiological findings with their underlying histopathology. These findings may have important surgical consequences. In a sample of patients with frontal lobe epilepsy, about 50% had an underlying diagnosis of focal cortical dysplasia. The pathology was not related to the surgical outcome. However, we found that contralateral head version, eye deviation and autonomic manifestions as ictal symptoms were associated with a poor outcome, whereas a focal abnormality on neuroimaging was related to a favourable outcome. Intraoperative electrocorticography (ECoG) in these patients revealed that dense epileptiform patterns (consisting of continuous spiking, bursts of spikes or recruiting discharges) in the preresection recordings were associated with a diagnosis of focal cortical dysplasia (sensitvity 94%, specificity 75%, positive predictive value 80%). The abolition of these patterns on postresection recordings was associated with a favourable outcome, whereas persistence of sporadic spikes and incomplete removal of histopathological abnormalities did not affect outcome. When studying the ECoG and histopathological findings in a sample of patients with neurodevelopmental lesions, we found that dense epileptiform ECoG patterns occurred in patients with focal cortical dysplasia, but also in those with a glioneuronal tumour (ganglioglioma or dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumour). One of these patterns, i.e. continuous spiking, was seen significantly more often in focal cortical dysplasia and this pattern was highly specific (96%) for the presence of a disorganized cortical architecture in the whole sample of patients. When studying patients with a cavernoma we found that dense epileptiform patterns occurred to a similar degree as in those with a neurodevelopmental lesion. In both patients with a neurodevelopmental lesion and cavernoma continuous spiking in the neocortex seems characteristic of early onset of seizures and such patterns may involve the hippocampus in time. We thus concluded that, in general, such patterns are not specific for neurodevelopmental lesions. We consider the expression of continuous neocortical spiking in the ECoG to be a marker of early disruption of functional systems in the developing brain. To investigate whether unilateral recognition memory was related to the neuronal integrity of the mesial temporal structures, metabolite ratios [NAA/(Cr+PCr), NAA/Cho, and NAA/(Cr+PCr+Cho)] from proton MR Spectroscopy were correlated with hemispheric memory scores from the Wada test. The total memory score, memory for objects and faces, and NAA/(Cr+PCr) were significantly lower for the hemisphere ipsilateral to the resection. Furthermore, we found positive correlations between unilateral memory for words and the NAA/(Cr+PCr) ratio from medial temporal structures in patients with mesial temporal sclerosis. The findings suggest that medial temporal structures play a significant role in recognition memory in humans, particularly for words and raise the question whether MR Spectroscopy can be used for presurgical memory lateralisation.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Religion, culture and polity have largely influenced what is unique about Bhutan today. As a Mahayana Buddhist Kingdom, Bhutan has inherited a philosophy of life that is deeply rooted in religious traditions and institutions. Basic values such as compassion, faith, respect for all life forms and nature, social harmony, the spirit of community participation and prevalence of spiritual development over material achievements have played a significant role in shaping modern Bhutan. The overall goal of development is to achieve sustainable development, which is guided by the development philosophy of pursuing ‘Gross National Happiness’. The way it will be pursued is through a unique development strategy called ‘the Middle Path Strategy’. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe aim of this study is to acquire a better understanding of the unique path towards sustainable development chosen by Bhutan. By analysing some specific cases, covering a broad field of sustainability issues that are relevant in Bhutan, we hope to inform our readers of how to understand development as a means of achieving Gross National Happiness. It also aims to understand the process of change, its implications, and particularly how it is rooted in society. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe approach this research by analysis of Bhutan’s development philosophy combined with empirical sector-studies. The empirical chapters form the heart of our research. The research methods for the Chapters are based on literature study and empirical research. The information was gathered in three rounds of interviews all over the country. In the first round information for Chapter 4 was gathered; in the second round information for Chapters 5 and 6; and in the third round for Chapter 7. \\r\\n \\r\\nSustainable development policy enjoys good support on the local level and in various stakeholder groups. The issue of social equity, especially the distributional aspects of the modernisation process, are a topic of discussion in the country. The challenge is to find a balance between openness and preservation, between hierarchy and participation, and between growing national income and distribution among the general population. The empirical study on the public perception on Bhutan’s approach to sustainable development in practice particularly, related to the four pillars of Gross National Happiness, highlights diverse views and expressions. The civil servants and people from civil society groups and the market fully support the spirit of this development strategy, although not always with a full understanding of the official concept. The local communities’ perceptions of nature conservation policy of the government is more skewed for the conservation of nature. In tourism, rural communities benefit from the trickle-down effect of tourism revenue. The ‘high value, low volume’ policy has been a successful policy so far in preventing negative environmental impacts. The Sustainable Development Agreement was well received in Bhutan and it provided lot of capacity building opportunities.  In the Netherlands; however, the government was sceptical about the agreement and therefore, the programme received less political support and some of the projects implemented in the Netherlands were criticised.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Neonatal Glucocorticoid Treatment and Predisposition to Cardiovascular Disease in Rats'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['The present thesis describes the issue of “neonatal glucocorticoid treatment and predisposition to cardiovascular disease in rats”. Glucocorticoid treatment, in particular dexamethasone, is widely used to treat or prevent chronic lung disease in premature infants. However, short and long-term side effects have been reported both in animal and human studies. Especially, the long-term neurological side effects such as cerebral palsy and delayed and abnormal neurological development have been studied. With regard to the cardiovascular system, the short-term side effects are well documented, but the long-term effects are still largely unknown. However, recent studies in adult rats indicated negative long-term effects of neonatal dexamethasone treatment on the heart and a severely reduced life expectancy. In this thesis we have therefore investigated the functional, histopathological and biochemical consequences of neonatal dexamethasone treatment on the heart during life span in rats. An earlier study from our group showed that neonatal dexamethasone treatment in rat pups caused a decrease in heart weight, probably due to inhibition of myocyte mitotic activity during treatment. Moreover this treatment resulted in permanent histopathological changes, in particular cellular hypertrophy, in the adult heart. We investigated the early effects of neonatal dexamethasone treatment in rats on cell proliferation after birth. We tested the hypothesis that a lower number of cardiomyocytes later in life was caused by a dexamethasone-induced, diminished cardiomyocyte proliferation and/or early cell death. This is a plausible assumption in view of the fact that GCs are administered during a critical period of cardiac development. In an experimental but established rat model, histopathological and immunohistochemical studies were performed to look at signs of apoptosis and/or differences in proliferation capacity of cardiomyocytes before, during and after dexamethasone treatment. Male rat pups were injected intraperitoneally with dexamethasone on day 1, 2, and 3 (0.5, 0.3 and 0.1 μg/g) of life. Control pups received saline in equal volumes. The rats were sacrificed at day 0, 2, 4, 7 and 21, and hearts were harvested. We found that dexamethasone treatment caused temporary suppression of cardiomyocyte hyperplasia which will lead to a reduced number of cardiomyocytes during life. To investigate the long-term cardiovascular side effects, cardiac function was determined after neonatal treatment with dexamethasone in 4-, 8-, 50- and 80-week-old rats, representing pre-pubertal, young adult, middle aged and elderly stages. The animals were anesthetized, intubated and ventilated, and a miniature pressure-conductance catheter was introduced into the left ventricle to measure pressure-volume loops. Cardiac function was measured and ventricular pressure-volume relations were determined to quantify intrinsic systolic and diastolic function, virtually independent of loading conditions. Subsequently, hearts were excised for histological examination. Our results showed reduced ventricular weights in 4-, 8- and 80-week-old dexamethasone-treated rats, but not in 50-week old rats. We showed a reduced systolic function in the 4-week-old dexamethasone-treated rats (end-systolic elastance: 1.24±0.43 vs. 2.50±1.39mmHg/μL, p=0.028) accompanied with a maintained cardiac output and increased end-diastolic volume (8423 vs. 5919μL, p=0.012), indicating a state of compensatory dilatation. These relatively early alterations in cardiac function were not followed by more severe dysfunction at 8-weeks. In fact at 8-weeks no difference in systolic function was detected between the dexamethasone-and Sal-treated rats. In the 50- and 80-week-old rats however, systolic function was depressed as evidenced by reduced ejection fractions and rightward shifts of the end-systolic pressure-volume relationships. Histopathologically, we found that dexamethasone treatment affects normal growth of the heart resulting in reduced heart weight, cellular hypertrophy, and increases in collagen deposition in the adult rat heart. The increase in cardiomyocyte cell volume induced by neonatal dexamethasone treatment was associated with long-lasting changes in the ventricular expression of contractile proteins (α-actin, MHC and β-MHC) without changes in the expression of structural proteins such as desmin and tubulin. It is conceivable that the increases in contractile proteins contribute to maintain cardiac function as an adaptive or compensatory response to the reduced cardiac cell number previously found. The studies described in this thesis support our hypothesis that neonatal exposure to dexamethasone in rats has serious life-long adverse consequences on the heart and consequently question the use of early neonatal GC treatment in the human setting. If our findings are confirmed in humans, this may have consequences for a potentially large patient population that has been treated with dexamethasone during the neonatal period in the early nineties up to now.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Characterization of biological mineralization in vitro'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Mineralization is an essential requirement for normal skeletal development, which is generally accomplished through the function of two cell types, osteoblasts and chondrocytes. Soft tissues do not mineralize under normal conditions, but under certain pathological conditions some tissues like articular cartilage and cardiovascular tissues are prone to mineralization. The aim of this study was to gain more insight in the processes that take place during the initiation of biological or cell-mediated mineralization and the effectors involved in these processes. Therefore, the mouse embryonal carcinoma-derived ATDC5 cell line was used in our study. It was hypothesized that serum, which is known to contain mineralization inhibitors such as fetuin, inhibits the early stages of mineralization in the cell culture system. Therefore, it was tested whether excluding serum from the medium shortened the cell culture period to induce mineralization, making this model system more suitable for investigation. This resulted in the development of large (sub millimetre size range) mineralizing structures (LMS) in the medium in 2 hours. LMS were shown to contain whole cells, which were embedded in hydroxyapatite and observed to have a stretched morphology. In the presence of serum no LMS were formed, but multiple small mineralized structures were observed inside the cell after 24 hours. Taken together, the results show that excluding serum in the cell culture system enhances rapid crystal growth and suggest that cell-mediated mineralization may start intracellularly. To investigate whether ATDC5 cells themselves or factors released by ATDC5 cells nucleate and/or remodel hydroxy-apatite in the absence of serum, the effect of conditioned medium from ATDC5 cells on the formation of apatite crystal was investigated. It was found that soluble factors released by the ATDC5 cells have the ability to affect the formation of the calcium-phosphate crystal. This suggest that soluble factors released by ATDC5 cells play a role in the growth phase of LMS formation once in the initial phase the crystal nucleus has been formed. Since an imbalance of mineralization may lead to pathological conditions, the ATDC5 cell culture system was also used to test the effect of several agents implicated in bone growth and development as well as pathological mineralization, including the gaseous substance nitric oxide (NO). Therefore, the effect of an NO donor drug, sodium nitroprusside (SNP) on cell mediated mineralization was investigated. It was found that 100 ?M SNP inhibits mineralization. However, the inhibition was not affected by inhibitors of guanylyl cyclase nor mimicked by a cGMP analog. Furthermore, sodium nitroprusside did not inhibit phosphate uptake nor inhibited apoptosis in the ATDC5 cells. Therefore, we subsequently investigated the effect of SNP on mineralization to elucidate the mechanism of action. It was shown that the iron moiety of sodium nitroprusside, rather than nitric oxide, inhibits mineralization.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Automatic Detection of Diabetic Retinopathy in Digital Fundus Photographs'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Diabetic retinopathy is a common ocular complication of diabetes. It is the most frequent cause of blindness in the working population of the United States and the European Union. Early diagnosis, and treatment can prevent vision loss in the majority of cases. Yet only approximately 50% of people with diabetes are regularly screened for the presence of signs of diabetic retinopathy. Computer aided diagnosis technology and digital retinal imaging could help to facilitate a large scale screening of people with diabetes. The research in this thesis is focused on the development of an automatic diabetic retinopathy detection system. This system would select exams which possibly contain signs of the presence of diabetic retinopathy and present only those to an ophthalmologist. In this manner the total workload of the ophthalmologist could be reduced. A number of different automatic screening system components are described and evaluated: An automatic system for the quantification of retinal image quality. Image quality is an important issue in large scale screening programs where images are acquired at many different sites, using different cameras and operators. It forms an essential component of an automatic screening system. Several different techniques for the automatic detection of the vasculature in retinal images are compared. A new technique is proposed and shown to exhibit good performance in comparison with the techniques from the literature. In addition to the vasculature, other anatomical landmarks are present on the retina, in particular the optic disc, the macula and the vascular arch. The location of these anatomical landmarks can be used to determine a relative position on the retina, and this spatial information about potential lesions can be used to remove false positive lesion detections and provide important diagnostic information. A system which is able to automatically find a set of points in a retinal image and thereby identify the location of the most important retinal anatomy is described. Red lesions are amongst the first signs of the presence of diabetic retinopathy and are therefore important to detect. An automatic red lesion detection system, based on a pixel classification approach, is described. When diabetic retinopathy progresses also bright lesions appear. An automatic detection system for these lesions is also presented. The individual system components are combined into a comprehensive screening system. This system is evaluated on a large dataset containing 40,000 images obtained in 10,000 eye examinations. A novel method is proposed to combine the outputs of the various system components into a single opinion about the complete examination. The results shown that the system is able to detect the majority of suspect exams at a specificity above 50%.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Gene expression analysis for assessment of lymph node metastasis in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) consists of a group of neoplasms that arise in the mucosal lining of the upper aero digestive tract. Treatment of HNSCC depends largely on assessment whether the patient has already developed lymph node metastases. However, due to difficulties in detecting cervical lymph node metastases reliably, many patients now receive inappropriate treatment which is accompanied by severe discomfort and complications such as shoulder disability. To improve the diagnosis of lymph node metastasis and to protect a significant number of patients from unnecessary neck surgery, current diagnostic methods need to be improved or new technologies need to be implemented. The primary goal of the work described in this thesis was to investigate the use of DNA microarray gene expression profiling of the primary tumor for assessment of lymph node metastasis in patients with oral cavity or oropharynx cancer. To identify a gene expression signature capable of predicting the presence of lymph node metastasis, a set of primary HNSCC tumor samples was analyzed for genome-wide gene expression patterns using DNA microarrays. Based on a supervised classification procedure, a set of 102 genes, was identified that showed optimal predictive accuracy. The accuracy was validated on independent samples and outperformed the current clinical diagnosis of lymph node biopsy. Most importantly for clinical relevance, no false negative predictions were made in this independent test of the signature. This predictive gene set indicates that treatment of HNSCC patients can substantially be improved by applying the DNA microarray predictor. Comparison of whole genome expression profiles from primary tumors with their corresponding lymph node metastasis indicates that gene expression patterns in lymph node metastases were most similar to the primary tumor from which they originate. Remarkably, both general and metastasis specific primary tumor gene expression patterns are maintained upon spread to the lymph nodes. Apparently, disseminated primary tumor cells do not need to undergo additional developmental changes for survival and proliferation in metastatic sites. This supports the theory that metastatic properties are acquired early during tumorigenesis and sustained throughout cancer progression. Despite the fact that many of the signature genes are expressed in the stroma, primary tumor samples with lower amount of tumor cells were more difficult to classify. Next, we showed that the decreased predictive accuracy for samples with low tumor content was caused by a skewed contribution of the predictor genes. Metastasis of HNSCC primary tumor is predominantly characterized by down-regulation of tumor cell specific genes and a concomitant exclusive upregulation of stromal genes. Correction of the skewed distribution resulted in an increased predictive accuracy, especially for low tumor percentage samples, and thus leads to an increase in samples which can be included in such analyses. Finally, in this thesis some important issues are discussed that need to be considered for optimal design of DNA microarray expression profiling studies in general and for implementation of diagnostic gene expression signatures in the clinic in particular.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['This thesis is based on findings of the Functional Prognostication and disability study on stroke, which had two main objectives: (1) to examine which outcome measures are most appropriate, and especially most responsive, for the assessment of functional outcome in stroke patients and (2) to study prognostic determinants of functional outcome and recovery after stroke. A total of 308 patients with a first-ever stroke were followed from admission to the rehabilitation center up to one year post stroke. We concluded that the Barthel Index, Functional Independence Measure total and motor score, Frenchay Activities Index (FAI) and Stroke-Adapted Sickness Impact Profile 30 (SASIP30) were all responsive measures. We recommend the use of the Barthel Index for the period until 6 months post stroke and the use of the FAI and SASIP30 for the period 6 months until one year post stroke. The ICF proved to be a useful tool to compare contents of instruments in stroke rehabilitation. The content of several known functional outcome measures that are frequently used in stroke rehabilitation were examined by linking the items to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). Most items fitted into the activities and participation component, with mobility being the category most frequently covered in the instruments. This content comparison enables professionals to choose the measure that best matches the area of their interest. We developed a prediction rule that could identify, at admission, patients at risk for social inactivity 1 year post stroke. Older patients, males, patients living with a partner, and patients with more problems with motor function, with communication and with ADL independence were more at risk for social inactivity 1 year post stroke. An easy-to-use score chart allows the identification of patients at risk and enables professionals to focus early on the social activity of this subgroup. Fatigue is an important post-stroke sequela. At admission, 6 months and 1 year post stroke, fatigue was present in 51%, 64% and 69% of the patients respectively. Fatigue impact 1 year post stroke was greater among patients with more depressive symptoms, higher age, females and patients with a locus of control more directed to powerful others. As fatigue impact is an increasing problem during the first year post stroke, it deserves more attention in clinical practice and scientific research. Functional recovery differed between patients with a cerebral infarction (CI) and patients with an intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) , in terms of the development of independence in Activities of Dailly Living (ADL) over the first year post stroke. From their admission to the rehabilitation center until 12 weeks post stroke, recovery tended to be more rapid for ICH patients than for CI patients. From 12 to 26 weeks post stroke, CI patients showed a significantly faster recovery. The time window for recovery of ADL independence was more restricted for ICH patients ( until 10 weeks post stroke) than for CI patients (until 26 weeks post stroke). These differences should be taken into consideration in stroke management.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['This thesis presents results from a longitudinal study in Schistosoma japonicum infected children, adolescents and young adults, carried out in the Philippines. The aim of this thesis was to describe nutritional morbidity and hepatic fibrosis in the context of S. japonicum infection and reinfection following treatment with praziquantel, and to evaluate potential immunological mechanisms involved in these morbidities. In addition, the potential immunomodulatory role of the puberty-associated hormone dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS) in the age-related decline of nutritional morbidity was evaluated. Following treatment with praziquantel, nutritional status as measured by Z-scores and hemoglobin levels improved, whereas S. japonicum reinfection had an overall negative impact on nutritional status. Reinfection was associated with iron deficiency anemia in the high reinfection intensities only. Conversely, reinfection was associated with non-iron deficiency anemia in all reinfection intensities. Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin (IL)-6 showed a dose-dependent positive association with intensity of S. japonicum infection and reinfection, suggesting that schistosomiasis induces systemic inflammation. Taken together, these results 1) strengthen the causal relationship between S. japonicum infection and undernutrition and anemia, 2) suggest this is mediated, in part, by proinflammatory cytokines, in particular IL-6, and 3) suggest that anemia of inflammation is the central mechanism responsible for anemia associated with S. japonicum infection. Based on these findings, treatment intervals in highly endemic areas should not exceed one year in order to prevent rebound morbidity due to reinfection. Furthermore, dietary supplementation should be combined with schistosomiasis control strategies in order to reduce nutritional morbidity in these areas. Independent of age and intensity of helminth infections, increased levels of DHEAS were associated with a reduction in inflammation-associated undernutrition and anemia, as well as with reduced serum levels of CRP, IL-1 and IL-6. These findings support the hypothesis that with increasing age, the anti-inflammatory effects of increased levels of DHEAS during pubertal development result in decreased proinflammatory cytokine-mediated nutritional morbidity. Both presence and severity of S. japonicum-associated hepatic fibrosis were associated with reduced nutritional status, and with increased serum levels of CRP, IL-1 and IL-6. These findings support the hypothesis that hepatic fibrosis induces systemic inflammation and thereby leads to undernutrition and anemia. Even individuals with mild fibrosis, which is generally considered clinically insignificant, had reduced nutritional status compared to those without fibrosis. This finding stresses the importance of early recognition and treatment of fibrosis. Persistent hepatic fibrosis, i.e. fibrosis that was diagnosed at baseline and remained present one year following treatment, was associated with increased levels of S. japonicum-specific IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13. This finding suggests that these pro-fibrotic T-helper 2 (Th2) cytokine responses, which may also protect against S. japonicum reinfection, play a role in the progression of hepatic fibrosis. Therefore, with development of a Th2-boosting vaccine against S. japonicum reinfection, worsening of hepatic fibrosis should be investigated as a potential adverse effect. Males experienced a higher prevalence and greater severity of both nutritional and hepatic morbidity than females. The increased risk of fibrosis among males may result directly from greater production of Th2 cytokines.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['This thesis aims to evaluate the diagnostic work-up in postmenopausal women presenting with abnormal vaginal bleeding. In the guideline of the Society of Dutch Gynaecologist and Obstetricians a gynecological examination, including cervical cytology, is followed by transvaginal sonography (TVS). When the endometrial thickness (ET) is 4 mm or less, the patient is reassured. In case of abnormal findings in the cervical cytology, or in case the ET is more than 4 mm or not assessable, endometrial sampling is indicated. When feasible an office endometrial sample is taken, else curettage preferably with hysteroscopy should be performed. We evaluated the guideline with respect to adherence, investigated the yield of cervical cytology and studied the final diagnosis in women with non-diagnostic office endometrial samples. We then focused on the prediction of endometrial cancer in women with postmenopausal bleeding in relation to patient characteristics, and subsequently if a strategy using both patient characteristics and TVS results could optimize the diagnostic process. The Dutch Study of Postmenopausal Bleeding (DUPOMEB) study group collected data on 913 women with postmenopausal bleeding in eight hospitals. Adherence to the guideline was present in more than 70% of the patients. The efficiency of the diagnostic process can however increase through limiting histological examination to women with ET > 4mm, and by relying on endometrium aspiration in these women. Cervical cytology is mandatory particularly to reveal cervical lesions, although a minority of endometrial cancers in women with ET < 5 mm are detected though cervical smear. The presence of normal endometrial cells in the cervical smear was not predictive for endometrial cancer. A non-diagnostic office endometrial sample was concluded on in 66 patients. Further evaluation of the endometrium was performed with hysteroscopy and/or curettage, or (uneventful) follow-up. Since three endometrial cancers and one atypical hyperplasia (6%) were discovered it was concluded that a technically well-performed office endometrial sample that is non-diagnostic does not rule out endometrial cancer, and necessitates further endometrial sampling. The performance of TVS in women with diabetes, hypertension and obesity was studied. In diabetic or obese women the mean endometrium thickness was higher than in women without these risk factors unless (pre)malignancy was found. Most women with diabetes and obesity will therefore need endometrial sampling. Presence or absence of hypertension had no impact on the accuracy of TVS. The efficiency of the diagnostic workup of postmenopausal bleeding can be improved when patient characteristics, i.e. age, the use of anticoagulants, parity and the presence or absence of diabetes, and overweight, are combined with ET. Incorporation in clinical practice might be through an algorithm or a clinical decision model, reducing the number of invasive procedures, without compromising accuracy. In endometrial cancer tumor type and grade, and depth of myometrial infiltration are important to decide upon adjuvant treatment. Preoperative selection of patients at high risk of pelvic lymph node metastases was performed by TVS assessment of myometrium infiltration in combination with tumor grading of the histologic specimen. Correct preoperative selection of low-stage, high risk patients was achieved in 80%.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Risicovoorspelling en risicoverlaging bij patienten met manifest vaatlijden Engelstalig abstract The number of patients with clinical manifest arterial disease is increasing because of the aging of the population. Patients with manifest arterial disease have an increased risk of a new vascular event in the same or different arterial bed. Medical treatment of vascular risk factors (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus) and lifestyle changes (healthy diets, exercise, quit smoking) can reduce the future risk. Studies presented in this thesis not only confirm the high prevalence of vascular risk factors in patients with manifest arterial disease, but also demonstrate the relevance of non-invasive screening on asymptomatic arterial disease. Standard screening for asymptomatic arterial disease identified a limited number of vascular abnormalities that necessitated immediate medical attention. But the screening revealed a high prevalence of peripheral arterial disease and carotid artery stenosis. Furthermore we found that the presence of asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis was associated with a 50% increased risk of recurrent vascular events (hazard ratio (HR) 1.5, 95% CI 1.1 - 2.1) in patients with clinical manifest arterial disease or type 2 diabetes but without a history of cerebral ischemia. Thus, the presence of asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis of ? 50% indicates higher risk in patients already known to be at high risk. We evaluated new strategies aiming at better risk factor-management in order to delay or to prevent progression of atherosclerosis. An additional letter to the treating specialist with medical treatment recommendations in case of new or poorly controlled risk factors resulted in marginal increase in medication use compared with trends in medication use in usual care. The extra care given by a nurse practitioner in addition to usual care and on top of a vascular screening and prevention program resulted in achievement of more treatment goals for systolic blood pressure (odds ratio (OR) 2.7, 95% CI 1.3 - 5.4), total cholesterol (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.5 - 7.3), LDL-cholesterol (OR 3.5, 95% CI 1.5 - 8.6), and BMI (OR 4.0, 95% CI 1.2 - 13.1) compared to usual care alone. Another way to achieve effective and efficient risk factor-management may be nurse practitioner guided treatment by Internet-communication with individual patients in addition to usual care. Goal setting to change behavior and the online-relationship between a nurse practitioner and a patient can continue for many years because of the repeated episodic nature of the atherosclerotic vascular disease process. The other part of this thesis concerns about risk prediction. The existing prediction models, intended for patients without cardiovascular disease or diabetes, underestimated the predicted risk in our cohort of patients with clinical manifestations of arterial disease. A new prediction model including traditional risk factors, history and extent of atherosclerosis showed that prediction of recurrent vascular events is possible after 1-year of follow-up but not at 3 or 5-years in patients with symptomatic cardiovascular disease. Indicators for a higher cardiovascular risk in patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease are older age (HR 1.85, 95% CI 1.48 - 2.30), impaired renal function (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.69 - 0.91), elevated homocysteine levels (HR 1.03, 95% CI 1.02 - 1.05), and a history of coronary heart disease (HR 2.30, 95% CI 1.51 - 3.51).'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['This thesis is based on the findings of the FuPro-Stroke study (the Stroke section of the Functional Prognostification and disability study on neurological disorders), which is a multicentre, prospective cohort study among patients with stroke, who were included during inpatient rehabilitation. The aim of the research reported on in the present thesis was to investigate the long-term prognosis of chronic stroke outcome up to 3 years after onset. Poor mobility status is a key concern in chronic stroke patients, especially since it may lead to ADL dependence and affect social reintegration. We found that mobility at one-year post stroke could be predicted by functional status, sitting balance, time between stroke onset and measurement, and age. We also investigated determinants that could predict decline in mobility status in chronic stroke patients. Inactivity in terms of instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), cognitive problems, fatigue and depressive symptoms at one year post stroke were the main predictors for deterioration in mobility. Community ambulation is an important outcome for stroke patients and we found that this variable was closely related to gait speed. The optimal cut-off point for community ambulation was 0.66 m/s. Balance, endurance and the use of an assistive walking device were determinants that confounded the relation between community ambulation and gait speed. The effectiveness of training programmes focusing on lower limb strengthening, cardio-respiratory fitness or gait-oriented tasks, in terms of the outcome of gait, gait-related activities and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) after stroke were also investigated. Twenty-one high quality RCTs were included, five of which focused on lower limb strengthening, two on cardio-respiratory fitness training and 14 on gait-oriented training. After conducting a meta-analysis we suggested that gait-oriented training is the most successful method to improve walking competency after stroke. Depression and fatigue are both well-known sequels after stroke. At three years post stroke, 19% of the patients showed depressive symptoms. Depression was best predicted by one-year IADL activity and fatigue. It was also shown that 68%, 74% and 58% of the patients experienced fatigue at 6, 12 and 36 months post stroke, respectively. Fatigue was significantly related to IADL and HRQoL, but not to ADL. Depression and motor impairment were important confounders in the relationship between fatigue and IADL and HRQoL. Since the number of stroke patients is rising and it is a chronic disease, it is important that appropriate care is provided to suit the needs of all these patients. We suggest in our study that 33% of the patients perceived at least one unmet care demand at three years after stroke. Younger age, motor impairment, fatigue and depressive symptoms were significantly related to the presence of unmet demands. These results suggest that our health care system is as yet not fully meeting the demands of patients with chronic stroke. Our advise is that the focus of care and research should be on improving our understanding of the course of functional recovery by monitoring patients over time, introducing innovative intervention strategies and exploring the underlying mechanisms of functional improvement after stroke.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Preoperative respiratory physical therapy in cardiac surgery'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Cardiac surgery is one of the most common surgical procedures and accounts for more resources expended in cardiovascular medicine than any other single procedure. Because cardiac surgery involves sternal incision and cardiopulmonary bypass, patients usually have a restricted respiratory function in the postoperative period. Moreover, anesthesia and analgesia affect respiratory function during and after the surgical intervention, causing changes in lung volume, diaphragmatic dysfunction, respiratory muscle strength, pattern of ventilation, and gas exchange, and in the response to carbon dioxide and oxygen concentrations. As a consequence of these changes, patients undergoing cardiac surgery have an increased risk of postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs), which lead to increased postoperative morbidity and mortality, increased use of medical resources, longer hospital stay, and increased health care costs. The incidence of PPCs varies between 20% and 95% in cardiac surgery, depending in part on the criteria used to define PPCs and on the diagnostic techniques used to document them. As a result of the generally high incidence of these complications (including mortality) and the high costs of hospitalization, efforts have been made during the last decade to identify those patients who have a higher chance of developing such complications, and to find ways to prevent their development. Considerable effort has been put into preventing and treating PPCs, but there is no consensus on the most appropriate or effective remedy. Controversy exists concerning the possible overuse and abuse of many of the therapeutic modalities commonly used for the prevention and treatment PPCs. A few experimental studies have demonstrated that preoperative physical therapy (e.g. pulmonary rehabilitation) in cardiac surgery has advantages over postoperative physical therapy alone. The effects of these programs, however, in decreasing the incidence of PPCs and in identifying those patients who might derive the most benefit, i.e. all patients or only high-risk patients, have not been proven indisputably. So, the aim of our project was to answer these three basic questions:\\r\\n\\n[1] Is preoperative physical therapy effective in preventing PPCs after cardiac surgery?\\r\\n\\n[2] What type of preoperative physical therapy is effective in preventing PPCs after cardiac surgery?\\r\\n\\n[3] Which patients benefit the most from this intervention?\\r\\n\\nThe studies described in this thesis demonstrate that it is possible to stratify preoperatively, patients according to their risk of developing PPCs, especially pneumonia, after CABG. We found that preventive physical therapy, including IMT, given to patients at high risk of PPCs before CABG decreased the incidence of PPCs (e.g. atelectasis and pneumonia) significantly and shortened the duration of mechanical ventilation and postoperative hospitalization. Our program is safe and well tolerated and should be implemented in regular care for these patients as soon as possible. In the future, it is expected that more fragile patients will undergo CABG, and in these patients preoperative physical therapy, including IMT, may be needed to help reduce the incidence of PPCs.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Human RSV-specific T cells'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of hospitalization due to lower respiratory tract infection in infants. While the majority of infants experience symptoms of a normal common cold, three percent of the entire birth cohort requires hospitalization due to severity of symptoms. While both CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells play an important role in clearing RSV infections, both T cell subsets might also augment disease. In a vaccine trial in the 1960s infants were vaccinated with formalin inactivated RSV. Upon natural infection, vaccinated infants experienced more severe disease leading to 80% hospitalisation and some deaths. This lead to a major setback in vaccine development. For the development of a safe vaccine in the future, more insight in this immune enhanced pathology is needed. Therefore, we investigated the role of both CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells during human RSV infections. To be able to study RSV specific responses, we identified new CD4+ T cell and CD8+ T cell epitopes. We found that infants with severe primary RSV infection elicited a mixed Th1-Th2 CD4+ T cell response against two overlapping peptides derived from the viral G protein that were presented by HLA-DPB1*0401 and *0402. The newly identified CD8+ T cell epitopes were used to study the RSV specific CD8+ T cell responses during severe primary RSV infections in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and PBMC of infants. Highly activated RSV specific T cells were identified in BAL samples of 95% of infants, with an average of 0.58% of CD8+ T cells. There was no correlation between the percentage of RSV specific CD8+ T cells and time of sampling or disease severity. However, in PBMC the highest percentage of activated virus specific CD8+ T cells correlated with disease severity. Next we investigated CD8+ T cell dynamics upon secondary respiratory infections. Early during heterologous infections, RSV and influenzavirus specific CD8+ T cells disappeared from blood, to re-appear several days later. To investigate whether these cells were recruited to the lungs we followed the CD8+ T cell dynamics in tracheal aspirate of children with a tracheostoma. Indeed, we showed the influx of a small percentage of RSV or influenzavirus specific cells upon heterologous infections of the respiratory tract, that disappeared within 14 days. Upon infection with homologous virus (RSV), both duration and magnitude of the RSV-specific response exceeded the bystander RSV-specific responses. During secondary RSV infection RSV specific CD8+ T cells peaked after two weeks, with an average of 1.3% of CD8+ T cells. Finally, we investigated the RSV specific CD8+ T cell responses in the elderly. While influenzavirus specific memory CD8+ T cells remain at stable levels throughout age, RSV specific CD8+ T cell numbers gradually decline, and were undetectable without in vitro expansion in PBMC of elderly people. In conclusion, the ability to study RSV specific T cell responses in different patient groups and healthy individuals provided important insight in the presence of memory and effector T cell types during health and disease, which might contribute to development of vaccines.'],\n",

Moreover, the possibility of targeting the players in this process with anticancer drugs like rapamycin, increased the interest from the clinical point of view. The identification of Rheb as a component of the insulin pathway, acting downstream of PI3K and PKB and upstream of the ser/thr kinase mTOR, revealed the connection between these two signaling cascades. mTOR acts as master switch between anabolic and catabolic cellular processes, regulating cell growth. Its regulation by nutrient availability has been known for long, however the mechanism by which hormones like insulin and growth factors control its activity, became evident when Rheb was identified as an activator of mTOR, directly regulated by these cues.'],\n",

       "  'Description': [\"Evaluation of pharmacotherapy and diagnosis and treatment of dementia are important subjects within geriatric medicine. Geriatric patients are more vulnerable for adverse events and pharmacokinetic interactions. Polypharmacy should be reduced, however, undertreatment of conditions or illnesses is also recognised in geriatric populations. Pharmacotherapy was evaluated in geriatric patients attending the diagnostic day-clinic and the geriatric ward of a general hospital. Vitamin supplementation, treatment of urinary tract infections and proton-pump-inhibitor therapy were the most frequently started therapies after evaluation. Although less frequent, medication was discontinued mostly because diagnoses were not longer relevant. Patients aged above 65 years are often excluded from clinical pharmacological research. We showed selected polymorphism in exon 12, 21 and 26 of the ABCB1 gene, encoding for the efflux pump P-glycoprotein, to be unrelated to the steady-state digoxin clearance in geriatric patients. Rivastigmine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, is registered for the indication mild-to-moderate severe Alzheimer's Disease. In clinical practice patients discontinue therapy because of adverse events and only a subset of patients is identified as a responder to therapy. Rivastigmine was primarily discontinued within the first 6 months of therapy because of adverse events, after 6 months mainly for therapy ineffectiveness. Absence of nurse support and not tolerating the minimal effective daily dose of twice daily 3 mg resulted in an increased risk for discontinuation of rivastigmine within 6 months after starting therapy. Rivastigmine shows a modest effect on cognition, activities of daily living and memory-related behaviour. Rivastigmine does not have clinically relevant treatment effects on disruptive behaviour, and depressive behaviour worsened during the first 6 months of treatment. Patients with a baseline Mini Mental State Examination score ?19 showed significant and larger responses to rivastigmine therapy. Differences in pharmacokinetics were not related to treatment outcome in Alzheimer’s disease patients and could not explain treatment variability in individuals. With the future possibilities of disease-modifying therapies it is becoming important to diagnose dementia preferably in a pre-clinical stadium or as early as possible in the clinical process, when pathological mechanisms have already been started. We showed that selected genotypes in exon 12, 21 and 26 of the ABCB1 gene, encoding for the efflux drug-transporter P-glycoprotein, are not useful as biological markers for different types of dementia. These ABCB1 single nucleotide polymorphism were not significantly different between dementia patients and age-matched non-demented control patients, or between different types of dementia. Furthermore, we used Surface-Enhanced Laser Desorption/Ionisation-Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS) to investigate amyloid ? profiles in cerebrospinal fluid and serum of patients with Alzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia and non-demented control patients. Certain peaks in cerebrospinal fluid, as obtained with SELDI-TOF MS, were significantly different between those patient groups. In serum, however, no significantly different peaks intensities were obtained between the three patient groups. Investigations in serum showed that the ABCB1 polymorphism in exon 21 (G2677T/A) was significantly related to the peak intensity of amyloid ?-40 and the SNP in exon 12 (C1236T) was significantly related to a peak at molecular mass 3891, corresponding to an unidentified amyloid-peptide.\"],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The transformation of a normal cell into a malignant cell is associated with genetic alterations that often result in abnormal chromosome sets (“aneuploidy”) and changes in the distribution of chromatin inside the nucleus. These changes are often subtle and are mostly referred to as “malignancy associated changes” (MACs). Unfortunately, these changes can not easily be detected through the microscope and can also be found in morphologically benign cells. To correctly discriminate between normal and (potentially) malignant cells these changes are therefore best not merely visually assessed but also mathematically quantified by image cytometry as “texture features”. The aim of the studies described in this thesis was to develop methods for quantification of the nuclear chromatin architecture by means of analysis of 3-D texture features as a potential aid in future tissue diagnosis and prognosis assessment of prostate cancer. TO-PRO-3 (a stoichiometric dye) for staining of the tissue specimens was used. After applying the staining procedure, 3-D image stacks were acquired with a confocal microscope. To obtain ploidy and texture feature measurements for single nuclei, a segmentation procedure was applied on the images. Thirty-five features thoughtfully chosen from 4 categories of (3-D) texture features (discrete texture features, Markovian features, fractal features, grey value distribution features) were selected and tested for invariance properties (rotation and scaling) using artificial images. In a pilot study we used the 3-D texture feature analyses to discriminate between benign and malignant prostate nuclei. For each patient, a pathologist selected benign regions and malignant regions, and from those two regions at most 300 nuclei were segmented. Together with the texture feature analysis, ploidy measurements were performed on the segmented nuclei from the 3-D image stack. Finally, we have applied our methods to study whether the differences in mortality rate between Afro-American men and Caucasian-American men having prostate cancer is simply explained by socioeconomic factors or by genetics factors resulting in morphological changes in the nuclear chromatin distribution as well. The best results to discriminate between benign and malignant cell nuclei were obtained when multivariate statistics using Linear Discriminant Analysis was employed instead of ROC analysis. We have shown that we are able to successfully discriminate between benign and malignant nuclei in 89% of the cases. In the successive studies described in this thesis, the many technical difficulties to obtain clinically useful analysis of 3-D nuclear chromatin distributions in prostate tissue have been overcome. It is now possible to successfully perform such analysis, although expensive equipment is required and throughput is low. The 3-D texture features as described in this thesis might well be useful for other types of tissues where there are variations in the distribution of nuclear chromatin. Therefore, by incorporating the sensitivity of nuclear texture features to detect small nuclear chromatin differences an earlier diagnosis can possibly be made.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The aim of this thesis was to study the activation of hemostasis and inflammation, in patients undergoing off-pump (OPCAB) and on-pump coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery and the relationship of coagulation and inflammation to clinical outcome. We hypothesized that activation of hemostasis and C-reactive protein (CRP) would be more pronounced in patients undergoing CABG using cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and that this would be associated with increased morbidity. In particular, neurocognitive dysfunction may be less pronounced in patients undergoing OPCAB procedures. Therefore, we did a number of studies in which we investigated several aspects of hemostasis in patients undergoing on- and off-pump CABG. Moreover, the influence of CRP as a marker of inflammation was studied as others have already demonstrated that CRP levels may be associated with increased morbidity after cardiac surgery. In 40 patients, randomly assigned to off-pump and on-pump CABG, we observed that CABG surgery with CPB was associated with increased thrombin generation and fibrinolytic activity in the immediate postoperative period. However, patients in the OPCAB-group demonstrated a delayed postoperative response that became equal in magnitude to the CPB group in the later (20-96 hours) postoperative period. Although early postoperative activation of hemostasis was more pronounced after on-pump CABG, we did not find any association with clinical outcome in the initial group and in a larger group of 73 CABG patients. Therefore, the clinical impact of CPB-related activation of coagulation remains to be determined. In contrast to our hypothesis, a significant association between early postoperative activation of hemostasis and the incidence of early postoperative cognitive decline was observed in 60 OPCAB patients. D-dimer levels and prothrombin fragments 1.2 at two hours after the off-pump procedure were strongly associated with early cognitive decline on postoperative day 4. Several mechanisms may be responsible for this apparent paradox. One contributing factor may be the fact that institution of CPB can obviously reduce the hypercoagulable state resulting from surgical trauma. In 60 on- and off-pump patients, we could demonstrate that von Willebrand Factor (VWF) release is increased after both procedures. However, VWF activity is significantly lower in the on-pump group. Shear stress-induced proteolysis due to the use of CPB may be one important factor responsible for this phenomenon. In the Octopus Study, the majority of the OPCAB patients received thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) in combination with general anesthesia. Postoperative activation of hemostasis may be affected by the use of TEA. We conducted a trial where we studied the effects of several LA on Tromboxane A2-induced platelet aggregation in an in vitro model. However, the LA tested had only limited ability to inhibit that Tromboxane A2-induced platelet aggregation. We were unable to demonstrate a significant interaction between CPB-induced activation of hemostasis, the inflammatory response to surgery and CPB and parameters of clinical outcome. We indeed observed an association between baseline CRP levels, a marker for chronic inflammation, and postoperative atrial fibrillation after both on-pump and off-pump CABG. Apparently, the relationship between postoperative CRP activation and the incidence of atrial fibrillation is not CPB-dependent.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The immune system constantly receives opposing signals that on the one side activate immune cells allowing them to eradicate diseased cells and pathogens, and on the other side inhibit these same cells to limit and ultimately terminate an immune response. A correct balance is crucial for effective defence against pathogens without affecting healthy tissues. One of the mechanisms of negative regulation in the immune system is provided by specialized inhibitory receptors that upon interaction with their ligands attenuate activation signals initiated by activating receptors. Loss of inhibitory signaling is often associated with autoreactivity and unchecked inflammatory responses, illustrating the essential role these systems play in immune regulation. This thesis is focused on the function of such an inhibitory receptor called leukocyte-associated immunoglobulin-like receptor (LAIR)-1, which is expressed on most immune cells in peripheral blood. Although the inhibitory potential and mechanisms of LAIR-1 inhibition are well established, the actual function of the receptor in vivo remains unknown due the lack of animal models and the unknown identity of the LAIR-1 ligand. In the first part we identified and characterized mouse and rat LAIR-1 orthologues of human LAIR-1. Like human LAIR-1, mouse LAIR-1 is expressed on immune cells and functions as an inhibitory receptor. Furthermore we show that human and mouse LAIR-1 bind to similar, but not identical, cytoplasmic signalling effector molecules. In the second part we identified collagens as ligands for the LAIR-1 molecules. Both transmembrane and extracellular matrix collagens interact with LAIR-1 and the interaction results in inhibition of immune cell functions via LAIR-1. Our data reveal a novel mechanism of peripheral immune regulation by inhibitory immune receptors binding to extracellular matrix collagens. Additionally, we studied the functional interaction of LAIR-1 and collagens by using synthetic trimeric collagen peptides overlapping the entire human collagen II and III proteins. We show that LAIR-1 binds to multiple sites on these collagens and that the relative content of collagen-specific glycine-proline-hydroxyproline triplets in the proteins is associated with increased LAIR-1 binding. Besides the transmembrane LAIR-1, humans encode soluble LAIR-2 receptors. For the first time we provide evidence that LAIR-2 is expressed in humans as a soluble collagen receptor and that the molecule can block the collagen/LAIR-1 interaction. Hence, we hypothesize that soluble LAIR-2 may function as a natural competitor for LAIR-1 in vivo, thereby regulating its inhibitory potential. Further studies should aim at dissecting the in vivo role of LAIR-1 and LAIR-2 in normal physiology and disease. Furthermore, detailed studies on the biochemical interaction between collagens and LAIR may allow rational design of new and potent research tools and could result in the development of therapeutics which exploits collagen/LAIR interactions.'],\n",

       "  'Description': [\"This thesis evaluates the prehospital care and outcomes of severely injured patients. Chapter 1 addresses the impact of trauma on society and presents a brief outline of this thesis with description of the different studies that are reported. Chapter 2 describes the patients who were studied and the methods that were used. The studies had a prospective cohort design. Data were collected on 507 trauma patients with multiple injuries, with a Hospital Trauma Index-Injury Severity Score (HTI-ISS) of 16 or more. Data were also collected on 574 victims of non-natural death during the same period (1999, 2000). Chapter 3 describes the history of prehospital care from ancient times to the present with emphasis on the Dutch situation. Chapter 4 presents the results of the study on non-natural deaths. included 361 (63%) men and 213 women who had died from non-natural causes. Suicide was the most frequent cause, followed by traffic accidents and accidents at home. Chapter 5 reports on the study entitled 'Ambulance care for seriously injured patients: do intensive training and examinations result in better outcome for patients?' The study compared the ambulance services offered by the RAVU, whose staff had been receiving additional intensified in-house training and other services whose staff at the time were receiving only the compulsory national training for all Dutch ambulance staff. Patients handled by RAVU staffs were more likely to receive intravenous infusion therapy and painkillers. Treatment time at the scene of the accident was 4.7 minutes shorter for those handled by RAVU. There was no relation between these measures and ultimate mortality rates or morbidity. Chapter 6 describes the value and reliability of the Triage-Revised Trauma Score in ambulance care. The time patients spent in the crashroom and duration of ICU admission were highly dependent on the T-RTS. There was a good correlation between the T-RTS and the HTI-ISS. The T-RTS was a good predictor of a patient's probability of survival. Chapter 7 reports on a study of the changes in Triage-Revised Trauma Score between first assessment in the field and arrival at the hospital, as a predictor of mortality. Intubation and deteriorating T-RTS values are powerful predictors of mortality after presentation in the hospital. Chapter 8 discusses a study with the objective to determine which factors predict death in trauma patients who are alive on arrival in hospital. There was a clear relationship between the base excess (BE) and haemoglobin levels measured at arrival in the ER and the risk of death. The risk of death was 3.4 times higher in cases with isolated neurotrauma. Chapter 9 discusses a study to determine the background and consequences of failing to diagnose certain injuries in severely injured accident victims in prehospital care. The percentage of diagnoses missed varied from 9 to 55%. Failing to diagnose an injury did not in itself increase the risk of death. Spine injuries were more frequently missed if associated injuries were more serious.\"],\n",

       "  'Title': ['The role of CTGF in diabetic nephropathy : Marker, pathogenic factor and target for therapeutic intervention'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a common complication of diabetes mellitus (DM) and a major cause of end stage renal disease. DN is a progressive fibrotic kidney disease that is structurally characterized by mesangial matrix accumulation and thickening of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM), and functionally by albuminuria and progressive decrease of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Hyperglycemia and hypertension are known risk factors for DN. Both these factors induce the pro-fibrotic growth factor transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β). Experiments in animal models have shown that inhibition of TGF-β can slow down or prevent development of DN. However, as TGF-β is also involved in important anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative processes, inhibition of TGF-β is not an attractive therapy for DN. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is an important downstream mediator in the fibrotic action of TGF-β. CTGF is upregulated by TGF-Β as well as by the diabetic milieu, which is characterized by hyperglycemia and advanced glycation end products (AGEs), increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and by mechanical strain (hypertension). The aim of this thesis was to study the role of CTGF in the development of diabetic nephropathy, with a special focus on the potential of CTGF as marker, pathogenic factor, and target for therapeutic intervention of DN. Measurement of CTGF levels in plasma of diabetic patients with and without nephropathy showed that plasma CTGF levels are increased in diabetic patients with DN and that these levels are associated with severity of DN. These data confirm that CTGF might be a useful marker for development and progression of DN. In experimental diabetic mice CTGF was significantly increased in plasma and urine, and urinary CTGF excretion correlated with albuminuria, the main early characteristic of DN. In addition, CTGF mRNA expression was increased in kidney, heart and liver tissue of diabetic mice. We identified the podocyte as the main source of diabetes-induced renal CTGF overexpression. Furthermore, in CTGF heterozygous mice (CTGF+/-), which lack one functional allele of the CTGF gene, we showed that lower CTGF levels in plasma and urine as well as lower CTGF mRNA expression under diabetic conditions, are accompanied by significantly lower albuminuria compared to diabetic CTGF+/+ mice, and by complete absence of GBM-thickening. Thus reduction of CTGF availability in diabetes appears to limit the severity of diabetic nephropathy. Glomerular activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which was significantly decreased in diabetic CTGF+/+ mice, remained completely preserved in diabetic CTGF+/- mice. It thus appears that increased expression of CTGF decreases the turnover of the GBM by reduction of the MMP-activity, resulting in increased GBM thickness. So far the mechanism of this CTGF-dependent decrease in MMP-activity is unknown. Together, the data presented in this thesis indicate that CTGF is a pathogenic factor in diabetic tissue remodeling, and a potential marker and therapeutic target for prevention and treatment of DN. Currently, diabetic patients with microalbuminuria are being recruited for a clinical trial to assess whether treatment with a CTGF-neutralizing antibody can help to prevent progression to diabetic nephropathy or even revert microalbuminuria to normoalbuminuria.'],\n",

       "  'Description': [\"Living with a chronic progressive disorder such as multiple sclerosis (MS) presents a challenge for both patients and their intimate partners. In addition to addressing the physical disability caused by MS, both patients and their partners must find ways to deal with the uncertainty of the disease's progression, changing role responsibilities and the psychosocial consequences. Being involved in a supportive relationship is believed to play a key role in adjustment to stressful life events such as chronic illness. Ample research has shown that the global perception that support is available when it is needed is related to greater psychological and physical well-being. However, results are less consistent when the effects of actual support or enacted support are studied. Some studies have documented positive effects, whereas others have shown neutral effects, or negative effects. These inconsistent results suggest that the effects of spousal interactions are not the same for each person, or that they depend on other factors that may interact with spousal interactions to determine its effect. This thesis considers daily supportive interactions with the partner among couples dealing with MS. The study is centred around two main issues: (1) The amount of support received and provided by both patients and partners. Interactions with the partners may change when one partner has a chronic illness. Partners are likely to provide more support and help to their partner, and receive less support in return. (2) The costs and benefits of received and provided support for patient's and partner's well-being. Both partners of 61 couples dealing with MS completed diaries for fourteen days and filled out questionnaires prior to completing the diaries and at seven months follow-up. Besides the diary method, other important features of the study were that both patients and partners were examined as receivers and providers of support and that we distinguished between emotional, instrumental and negative interactions. Further, specific attention was given to differences between patients and partners, both in the amount of support that was given and received as well as the relation between supportive interactions and well-being. Additionally, it was examined whether patients and partners perceived their relationship as imbalanced and whether this effected their well-being. It was shown that instrumental interactions between patients and partners were imbalanced; patients reported providing less instrumental support than partners. However, patients and partners provided equal amounts of emotional support. Overall not much support was found for the costs of receiving or providing emotional or instrumental support. In contrast, the results underscribe the importance of emotional support for both patient's and partner's well-being. Additionally, both patients and partners benefited from providing instrumental support. Negative responses received from the partner were negatively related to patient's and partner's end-of-day well-being, however, this effect was not as potent as we expected based on previous studies and this effect was moderated by the receipt of emotional support. Finally, the results showed that when patients were more disabled, patients and partners may perceive their relationship as imbalanced, which has negative consequences for the level of depression of both.\"],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Systemic inflammatory responses in asthma'],\n",
       "  'Description': [\"In asthma, inflammatory cells undergo a process referred to as priming. During priming responses, cells are not directly activated by inflammatory stimuli, but acquire increased responsiveness towards heterologous stimuli. The focus of the studies presented in the thesis of Willem ten Hove was directed towards the regulation and outcome of priming of leukocytes: granulocytes and monocytes in several phenotypes of asthmatics. As treatment of inflammatory processes in asthmatics is predominantly based on inhibition by corticosteroids, the effects of steroids were studied on several effector functions of granulocytes. To understand the regulation of priming and activation in granulocytes, components of intracellular signalling pathways were studied. In this thesis in vivo priming was measured by determination of cellular expression profiles of priming associated epitopes on leukocytes or via gene expression analysis. Using priming of leukocytes in vivo as readout for inflammatory processes in pulmonary tissue, it was confirmed that (mild) asthmatics with well-controlled disease patterns were characterized by a phenotype with clear systemic inflammatory responses that involved primed eosinophils, subtle primed neutrophils and unprimed monocytes in peripheral blood. Poorly-controlled asthmatics, which were relatively difficult-to-treat, were characterized by primed neutrophils and monocytes. From these patient-data it was concluded that determination of priming of leukocytes is a biomarker, which has a high potential in the characterization of asthma phenotypes. To further characterize the cellular mechanisms and effects that are responsive to the inflammation induced priming of granulocytes the granulocyte responses to anti-inflammatory corticosteroids were evaluated. The focus was directed to processes involved in eosinophil recruitment to inflammatory sites, which include eosinophil adhesion and migration. Interestingly, steroids inhibited both responses of eosinophils, provided that the experiments were performed in the presence of priming cytokines. These data are consistent with a model that eosinophils in vivo are only inhibited by steroids after priming by inflammatory mediators. Potential rapid (non-genomic) effects of steroids on several functional responses of eosinophils were also investigated. Incubation of eosinophils with steroid dexamethasone (Dex) for 15 min resulted in a clear functional upregulation of the immunoglobulin (Ig)A receptor (FcαR). It seems likely that this Dex-induced selective priming of FcαR has an important impact on the control of eosinophils in asthma, because both eosinophils and IgA are abundantly present at mucosal surfaces and IgA is an important secretagogue of these immune cells. After the identification of steroid-induced priming of FcαR, the underlying 'inside-out' signals have been investigated. These investigations showed that steroid-induced FcαR activation was regulated via the glucocorticoid receptor. Further characterisation of this 'inside-out' signalling showed a central role for kinase P38 MAPK in the signal transduction towards the functionality of FcαR. Studies performed in this thesis have provided evidence for distinct systemic responses of leukocytes in different phenotypes of asthma and gave more insight in the regulation of leukocyte priming and the effects of steroids on leukocyte functions. The characterization of asthma phenotypes and their underlying priming responses might help the development of useful and more tailor-made pharmacotherapy for the different asthma phenotypes.\"],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The thesis describes techniques that can be used to reduce or eliminate artefacts arising due to magnetic field disturbances and/or motion in temperature maps obtained by the Proton Resonance Frequency Shift (PRFS) method of MRI temperature mapping. The first chapter describes a hardware modification, which enables PRFS temperature mapping during percutaneous transluminal angioplasty performed using a hot balloon. It is proposed to separate in time media injection and heating by first inflating a balloon with a media at an initial temperature, and then by heating the media up using laser light. The separation is shown to eliminate flow, motion and susceptibility-redistribution artefacts and to enable real-time MRI temperature mapping using the PRFS technique. The second chapter describes a post-processing technique, which eliminates temperature artefacts caused by breathing. A set of baseline images characterizing Respiratory Induced Resonance Offset (RIRO) at a variety of respiratory cycle instants is acquired before the thermal treatment starts. During the treatment, the temperature evolution is found from two successive images. Then, the calculated temperature changes are corrected for the additional contribution caused by RIRO using the pre-treatment baseline images acquired at the identical instances of the respiratory cycle. The third chapter describes an acquisition and post-processing technique, which utilizes the fat signal to improve the immunity of the PRFS method of MRI temperature mapping against magnetic field disturbances. The described method is based on the utilization of several gradient and spin echoes acquired within one repetition interval with water and fat-selective scans. The fourth chapter describes an approach to post-processing PRFS temperature maps acquired during High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) treatments, which allows the user to extract from the maps some additional information that can be used to monitor the treatment in a more safe and reliable way as well as to adjust the treatment in case it deviates from the desired scenario. A set of mathematical operations (including discrete analogues of time derivative, directional derivative, gradient and Laplacian) is applied to temperature maps to reveal the HIFU beam waist, focus, heat deposition site and their evolution during sonications. The location of the maximum temperature spot is identified and traced as well as its displacements are visualized and characterized. The resulting images reveal the information, which is usually hidden on the traditional temperature maps.'],\n",

Of major concern is the realization that while the incidence of endometrial carcinoma has remained stable over the past 2 decades, the number of deaths annually from this disease has more than doubled. Presumably the cause of these sobering statistics are multifactorial, but it obligates us to reassess more objectively and critically the screening, diagnostic, staging, and treatment processes that guide the overall management of this neoplasm. In the present manuscript we performed a review of selected publications from Mayo Clinic on endometrial cancer that appeared in the literature during the last decade. We gave a contribution to a better definition of the role of lymphadenectomy and surgical staging in endometrial cancer. Moreover, we defined a different approach to postoperative management. In fact, as opposed to modality-based therapy (i.e. using radiotherapy in patients considered at high risk for recurrence), we introduced the concept of disease-based postoperative treatment, targeting the predicted site of recurrent disease. We defined guidelines for the management of endometrial cancer, in the attempt of improving the treatment approach to endometrial cancer and the outcome of patients.'],\n",

       "  'Description': [\"The overarching aim of this study is to develop a GIS-based planning approach that contributes to equitable and efficient provision of urban health services in cities in sub-Saharan Africa. Its prime concern is with (i) the identification of theoretical and methodological constructs that can be used to analyse and improve the spatial performance of public health service delivery systems, and (ii) the development of a corresponding spatial-analytic and GIS-based planning approach using Dar es Salaam as a case study. The broader context of the study is the 'urban health crisis'; a term that refers to the disparity between the increasing need for medical care in urban areas against the declining carrying capacity of existing public health systems. The guiding principles of the primary health care approach (equity, effectiveness and efficiency) form the point of departure of the research. They demonstrate that health care provision is inevitably tied up with issues of resource allocation, distribution and priority setting. Decisions have to be made about the nature and range of services to provide and how they are distributed amongst the members of society. Such decisions are informed by economic, political, medical and ethical considerations but - as this research underlines - should also consider the spatial dimension. To evaluate alternative spatial distributions in equity and efficiency terms and suggest improvements, spatial performance indicators are required. Such indicators are generated via the accessibility concept which is seen as a notion with a socio-economic as well as a spatial dimension between which important interactions exist. The analysis culminates in a 'what if' type of planning approach designed to evaluate and improve the spatial performance of the Dar es Salaam governmental health care system. In doing so it illustrates how more sophisticated GIS-based analytical techniques can be usefully applied in support of strategic spatial planning of urban health services delivery. It consists of an evaluation and an intervention framework. The evaluation framework appraises the performance of the existing Dar es Salaam governmental health delivery system on the basis of generic quantitative accessibility indicators. The intervention framework explores how existing health needs can better be served by proposing alternative spatial arrangements of provision using scarce health resources. It consists of a set of 'what if' type of planning instruments that can support health planners to (i) detect spatial deficiencies of a given delivery system, (ii) propose priority spatial planning interventions and (iii) estimate the expected impact of potential interventions on spatial performance. When used in concert the developed planning instruments offer a flexible framework with which health planners can formulate and evaluate alternative intervention scenarios and deal with the most important problems involved in the spatial planning of urban health services. The planning instruments, finally, are designed to contribute to making informed spatial decisions; not to automate but rather to support part of the planning process.\"],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Bacterial DNA contains unique unmethylated CpG motifs. The cytosine-phosphate-guanisine (CpG) sequence of this motif has an unmethylated cytosine which is suppressed or methylated in mammalian DNA. Synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides containing these CpG (CpG-ODN) motifs are called Immunostimulatory DNA Sequences (ISS). Our goal is to gain a better understanding of how ISS, a TLR9 agonist, modulates the immune response and how this response may influence chronic inflammation in those with Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). JIA is the most common rheumatic disease in children with an incidence of 1 in 1,000. It is defined as chronic arthritic conditions lasting for a minimum of three months affecting children under the age of 16 years. JIA is often characterized by a waxing and waning course, with flares separated by periods of time during which no symptoms of active synovitis are noted (remission). This is especially the case in the Oligoarticular subtype (OA-JIA) that is characterized by prolonged periods of medication-free remission of the disease. However, the polyarticular subtype (PA-JIA) is more severe and has a worse prognosis. The first part of this thesis demonstrates the potential candidacy of ISS as a future vaccine adjuvant with its Th1 promoting properties when administered systemically as well as at mucosal sites. Furthermore, ISS was shown to be arthritogenic in an experimental arthritis model such as adjuvant arthritis (AA). This led us to explore the safety and efficacy of a human vaccine with a bacterial component such as the MenC vaccine in the JIA population addressing the issue of whether an immune response to a bacterial antigen may harbor the risk of exacerbating autoimmunity in susceptible individuals. The MenC vaccine proved to be safe and effective in the JIA population, despite administration of immune suppressive medication. Moreover, we also investigated the quality and quantity of the immune response elicited by the OA-JIA as well as PA-JIA after vaccination towards vaccine and arthritis associated antigens including their regulatory mechanisms. When compared to the OA-JIA group or healthy individuals, the poly-articular subgroup’s greater T cell proliferation to an environmental trigger (the MenC vaccine) corresponds to a dysfunction of their CD4+CD25+ Tregs (despite their greater numbers), the suppressors of the immune response. This suggests that the hyperproliferation seen in the PA-JIA may be the result of the lack of function of the CD4+CD25+ Tregs potentially due to their higher levels of TNF-alpha. In summary, vaccinations and, by extension, infections may break tolerance in those predisposed to autoimmunity potentially leading to aggravation or even induction of the disease. It is conceivable that subunit vaccinations do not evoke a pro-inflammatory response that is strong enough to induce or exacerbate chronic inflammation. However, the risk may still exist, especially for live-attenuated vaccines known to induce more vigorous immune response. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the effects of every new vaccine in those predisposed to chronic inflammatory diseases both clinically as well as immunologically.'],\n",

A subset of these even seems to have a critical function in regulating cell cycle transitions. In this thesis, I have addressed the importance of transcriptional control in the regulation of cell cycle progression, in particular at two critical transitions: the G0/G1 transition (cell cycle entry/exit) and the G2/M transition (coordination between DNA replication and segregation). In particular, my attention has focussed on the role of transcription factors of the Forkhead family in these transitions.\\r\\nIn the first part of the thesis (chapters 1 to 3), the role of transcriptional regulation in cell cycle entry/exit was investigated. The background information on cell cycle entry/exit in the context of the immune compartment will be presented in Chapter 1, as T cells were used as experimental system in order to investigate this question. In particular, human primary T cells were used as they represent a particularly nice model for cell cycle entry of quiescent cells upon TCR stimulation. In addition, the mechanisms by which proliferation can be suppressed in inadequately proliferating T cells such as leukaemic T cells have been addressed in more detail. This can be achieved at different levels: by preventing T cell activation, by inducing a cell cycle arrest, or by inducing apoptosis. The cAMP-dependent pathway is known to suppress T cell proliferation and to induce tolerance in normal T cells. This is targeted by numerous drugs used in the clinic for immunosuppression or anti-cancer therapy. In Chapter 2, induction of cAMP-dependent signalling was examined as a way to suppress proliferation in leukaemic T cells. In Chapter 3, the role of FoxO Forkhead transcription factors in the regulation of cell cycle progression and apoptosis was studied in normal T cells. In particular, attention was focussed on their role during/after T cell activation.\\r\\nIn the second part of this thesis (chapters 4 and 5), the role of another Forkhead transcription factor, FoxM1, in G2/M was investigated, and in particular, the regulation of FoxM1 transcriptional activity during the cell cycle. After reviewing the role of FoxM1 in cell cycle regulation and carcinogenesis in Chapter 4, the mechanisms of activation and inactivation of FoxM1 during cell cycle progression are discussed in Chapter 5. More specifically, the focus of the studies has been on the role of Cyclin A in FoxM1 activation during S/G2-phases and the mechanisms of inactivation of FoxM1 during mitotic exit. The observations made in these studies can explain the low levels of FoxM1 protein and activity during the G1-phase of the cell cycle. These mechanisms may involve FoxM1 dephosphorylation and degradation during mitotic exit. Finally, the main findings of these studies and their implications for further research will be summarized and discussed in Chapter 6.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The present thesis was designed to evaluate the qualitative and quantitative aspects of plastic surgery research by means of a bibliometric citation analysis of plastic surgical presentations and publications. Citations to such published work provides an indication of the impact and the relevance of the scientific contribution. The quantity and the number of citations to publications by plastic surgeons and residents from The Netherlands increased during the last 50 years. Most specialists published from the moment of their graduation at medical school until 6 years after their registration as plastic surgeon. Current residents published more and better than their predecessors. Surgeons and residents published the greater part of their work in plastic surgery journals with relatively high impact factors. For each given year, this impact factor is the number of citations to articles published in the journal over the two previous years divided by the total number of citable articles published in that journal during the same two years. Citation of published work by other researchers provides an indication of the scientific relevance of one’s work, and the number of citations in specialist journals may be used to measure the relative impact of scientific work. Consequently, the impact factor is increasingly used to establish to whom grants, subsidies, and awards are appointed. Likewise, the relative importance of a journal may be established on the basis of citations made to its individual articles. However, the journal IF was found to be a particularly weak indicator of scientific value of surgical publications as we found that most citations to such publications are made after the period of two years that is critical to the IF. Additionally, a limited number of articles is likely to attract the bulk of citations to that journal and less-cited articles may be given credit because of the impact of these few, frequently cited articles. The most cited articles dealt with the reconstruction of acquired defects and with basic or experimental research. Most articles still originate from the USA, but the absolute and relative number of articles originating from Europe and Asia is rapidly increasing. Authors from small countries have a more efficient output relative to the number of inhabitants and GDP of their country. Nevertheless, in practice, the main determinant to cite an article is often the impact factor of the journal, not the methodology or quality of research. It is of great concern that the impact factor which is accepted as a measure of journal quality contains a fundamental statistical error which influence editors, peer reviewers, grants, awards and subsidies distribution in a negative manner. Therefore, we calculated an alternative for the present journal impact factor by means of The Journal Performance Indicator Revisited (JPIR).'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Patients with asthma or COPD are often treated with inhaled corticosteroids. These drugs reduce the inflammation in the lungs and patients suffer fewer exacerbations. In the late nineties, a tendency to treat patients in general with higher doses of inhaled corticosteroids was accompanied with an increased attention to systemic side effects. Previous studies have linked the intake of high doses of inhaled corticosteroids with porous bones and risk of fracture. However, patients using high doses of inhaled corticosteroids often have more severe asthma or COPD. In this thesis, it was found that patients using high doses of inhaled corticosteroids were at greater risk of fracture. Howver, this was largely explained by the severity of the respiratory disease instead of a causal effect of inhaled corticosteroids.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Burnout and Work Engagement: Exploring Individual and Psychophysiological Differences'],\n",
       "  'Description': [\"Burnout has been a major topic in occupational health psychology for the past three decades, and work engagement, presumed to be burnout's opposite, recently gained increasing interest. The two main research questions of this thesis were: (1) To what extent can burnout and work engagement be described in terms of personality dimensions?; and (2) Are burnout and work engagement related to the (stress) physiological state of the body? Burnout was shown to be primarily characterized by high neuroticism, whereas low neuroticism in combination with high extraversion characterized work engagement. With regard to temperament, “mobility” (the capability to adapt quickly to changes in the environment) characterized engaged persons. It was concluded that burnout and work engagement are associated with personality traits. Two physiological stress systems were examined, that is, the Hypothalamic Pituitary Adrenal axis (HPA-axis), and the cardiovascular system. The HPA-axis is the central mechanism in the long-term adaptation of an individual to his or her environment, and its functioning is measured by cortisol and DHEAS. The cardiac autonomic system consists of two different branches, the sympathetic system and the parasympathetic (vagal) system. The sympathetic system is involved in activity and arousal, whereas the parasympathetic system has a prominent role in recovery and restoration. The burned-out and engaged group neither differed from each other, nor from a control group, with respect to morning cortisol levels, the cortisol awakening response (CAR), DHEAS levels, and the cortisol / DHEAS ratio. The engaged group only showed a slightly stronger cortisol suppression than the burned-out and control group in response to dexamethasone, indicating a higher feedback sensitivity of their HPA-axis. The burned-out and engaged group did not differ either from each other or from a “normal” control group, with regard to cardiac autonomic (sympathetic and parasympathetic) functioning, as ambulatory measured in their daily life. In addition to the investigation of two specific (stress) physiological systems, the possible impact of stress on different bodily systems simultaneously was also examined, using a composite measure called the allostatic load index. The allostatic load index includes parameters representing different physiological systems (e.g., metabolic and immune system). Burnout was not associated with a higher score on allostatic load as compared to healthy controls, and it was concluded that allostatic load is not a mediator between burnout and impaired physical health (e.g., cardiovascular disease). In short, there is no diagnostic value for peripheral measurements in burnout or work engagement, and they are not useful to predict the future physical health status of individuals. The challenge for future researchers interested in the relation between burnout, work engagement and psychophysiology (or even physical health) is to focus on central mechanisms (e.g., dopaminergic, serotonergic and noradrenergic systems), or on brain processes covered by measures in the field of affective neuroscience (e.g., EEG, fMRI)\"],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Signal transduction pathways play important roles in cell differentiation, proliferation, and survival. Specific protein-protein interactions mediate the assemblies of protein complexes in response to different signals therefore regulate the proper transmission of cellular signals. Inappropriate protein-protein interactions within signalling pathways can lead to many diseases, including cancer. Proteomics-based approaches, which enable the quantitative investigation of protein-protein interactions involved in signalling networks, provide us with techniques to define the molecules controlling various signalling pathways. The small GTPase Rap1 belongs to the Ras family and shares high similarity with Ras protein. Rap1 cycles between an inactive GDP-bound state and an active GTP-bound state. This cycle is regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), such as Epac and GTPase activating proteins (GAPs), such as Rap1GAP. The most well-established processes where Rap1 is involved in include integrin-mediated adhesion and cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion. The GEFs are regulated by second messengers and are part of a protein-protein network, which regulates their temporal and spatial activities. The objective of the work described in this thesis was to investigate how Rap1 signaling pathway is regulated and to identify and characterize signaling proteins that direct the Rap1 pathway. In chapter 2, we studied the relation between AF6 and Rap1. We show that the overexpression of AF6 inhibits Rap1 induced adhesion. In addition, knocking-down the endogenous AF6 increases adhesion. These results show that in Jurkat T cells, AF6 functions to buffer GTP-Rap in resting cells and negatively regulates Rap1 function. In chapter 3 we analyze three Rap-like pseudogenes (mRap1A-retro1, mRap1A-retro2 and hRap1B-retro) in mouse and human genome. We show that all three retrogenes are expressed and encode functional proteins. These proteins appeared to stay more in a GTP-bound state compared to wild type Rap1. More interestingly, they exhibit clear differences in their ability to induce cell adhesion and spreading. To gain more insight in the protein interaction network, which controls the spatial and temporal organisation of Rap specific GEFs we performed yeast two-hybrid screens using Epac and PDZ-GEF as baits. This is described in chapter 4 addendum. A general summary of the results is given and candidate proteins were discussed. In chapter 4 and chapter 5 we characterized in detail the interaction between ERM (Ezrin-Radixin-Moesin) proteins and Epac1. We show that both Ezrin and Radixin interact with Epac1 in an activation-dependent manner. The Ezrin/Radixin binding region was identified in the N-terminus of Epac1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this region is also required for the localization of Epac1 at microvilli in fully polarized cells. We show that Ezrin couples the activation of the ?-adrenergic receptor to Rap1 signalling via the recruitment of Epac1. In chapter 5 a novel Radixin mutant was characterized. This mutant Radixin in which both I577 and F580 are substituted for aspartic acids fulfils the classical criteria of being in an active state. Interestingly, active Radixin facilitates Rap1 activation and Rap1 mediated adhesion.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Respiratory Syncytial Virus is a major cause of childhood lower respiratory tract infections. Seventy percent of all children are infected in their first year of life, and nearly all children by age three.  Although the majority of patients suffer a relatively mild upper respiratory tract infection, 3% of infected children are hospitalized and require oxygen support. Risk factors for a severe RSV infection are pre-maturity, congenital heart disease and bronchopulmonary dysplasia, although genetic predisposition also seems to play a role. Unfortunately however, the precise mechanism(s) of severe lower respiratory tract disease remain unknown. T cells play an important role in clearing the virus from the infected lung. However, T cells may also be involved in immune pathology that can be associated with respiratory disease. The scope of this thesis was to investigate the mechanism of the initiation of the cellular immune response after RSV infection. New insights of the interaction of the virus with the immune system can provide new directions for the rational design of a vaccine. In the first part of this thesis we focused on characterization of T cell epitopes. One CD4 T cell epitope was found to be HLA-DP4 restricted. The HLA-DP4 restricted epitope is an interesting finding since HLA-DP4 is the most prevalent HLA class II molecule, and epitopes presented by this HLA allele can therefore be used as a tool to measure RSV specific T cell responses in a large population. Furthermore five CD8 T cell epitopes were identified. All epitopes were proven to be processed and presented by RSV infected antigen presenting cells. The information obtained from these studies allowed us to monitor virus specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses and extend the knowledge on the interplay of RSV with the adaptive and innate immune systems. Furthermore, we addressed the question whether mutations in the NS proteins of natural RSV isolates would lead to altered cytotoxic T cell responses, because the NS proteins interfere with the host capacity to induce type I interferon production and thus interfere with the capacity of the cell to suppress viral replication. We found three novel amino acid changes in NS proteins in virus isolates. The mutations lead to altered CD8 T cell responses.\\r\\nDendritic cells are considered professional antigen presenting cells crucial for the initiation of immune responses. They have the ability to direct and polarize T cells. Since DC are abundantly present in the airways, the effect of RSV infection on DC and how RSV infection impacted on the ability of DC to initiate T cell activation was studied in the second part of this thesis. We have found that RSV-infected myeloid DC secreted an a as yet un-identified soluble suppressive factor that was responsible for the inefficient expansion of naive T cells and an impaired cytokine production by the cells that did expand. In contrast to the inhibitory effect on proliferation by both naive and memory T cells RSV-DC were not impaired in the ability to induce IFN-  in memory CD4 and CD8 T cells. Moreover, antigen processing and presentation via the HLA class I and II route were intact in RSV infected DCs. We observed that exposure of DC to inactivated RSV did not lead to the inhibitory phenotype of DC. These DC were able to present viral peptides via both HLA class I and II, which demonstrated that DC could internalize inactivated virus and stimulate CD8 T cells by cross-presentation.'],\n",

       "  'Description': [\"Burnout is characterized by emotional exhaustion, feelings of depersonalisation and reduced professional competence. It is an adverse health outcome to chronic work-related stress and insufficient recovery. The main aim of this thesis was to search for physiological disturbances in persons with severe burnout. HPA-axis function, salivary DHEAS, and in vitro immune function were investigated in clinically diagnosed burnout participants. Diagnosis was based on ICD-10 criteria for 'work-related neurasthenia' in combination with a semi-structured DSM-IV interview. Contrary to initial findings in a pilot-study, the cortisol awakening response (CAR), the cortisol decline during the day and cortisol suppression after a low-dose dexamethasone (DST) intake were not different in a burnout group compared to a healthy control group. The burnout related complaints; fatigue, depressive symptoms, sleep quality, and general psychopathology were significantly reduced after a treatment period, remained stable at follow-up but did not show complete recovery. There were no longitudinal changes in the CAR or DST and a small decline in the day-curve. A decrease in exhaustion and depression after treatment were related to a decrease and an increase respectively of the CAR after treatment and at follow-up, however this finding explained little variance of the changes between and within the burnout group. There were no other correlations with the complaints. The burnout group showed significantly higher DHEAS levels. Stimulated monocytes produced more of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in burnout, but no change was observed in the pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine (IFN-γ and IL-10 resp.) release by PHA-stimulated T-cells, nor in pro-inflammatory cytokine (TNF-α) release of LPS stimulated monocytes. No changes were observed in circulating T-cells, B-cells or NK-cells. In addition, the capacity of dexamethasone to regulate cytokine release in vitro was not different between the burnout and the control group. We conclude that there is no predictive or diagnostic value for cortisol in severe burnout. There may be a role for DHEAS. The increased IL-10 release by monocytes may be the basis of an increased sensitivity for common cold- or flu-like symptoms in burnout, however the HPA-axis does not appear to be involved.\"],\n",

       "  'Description': ['For the prevention of meningococcal infection caused by group B meningococci, the Netherlands Vaccine Institute (NVI) has developed a hexavalent Porin A (PorA) based Outer Membrane Vesicle (OMV) vaccine (Hexamen). In various clinical studies with HexaMen, differences in the immune responses to the individual PorAs were observed. Factors involved in the development of the PorA specific immune response were studied, including the role of B and T cells. Also, alternative formulations or immunization schedules using the available monovalent and hexavalent candidate vaccines were investigated to optimize the immune response. To address these issues, studies were undertaken using P1.7-2,4 as a model for a weakly immunogenic PorA antigen, while P1.5-1,2-2 was used as a strongly immunogenic PorA model antigen. The influence of the composition of a PorA OMV vaccine on the immune response was limited, indicating that these are caused by intrinsic properties of the PorA antigen itself. We investigated the possibility to optimize the immune response against weakly immunogenic PorAs using immunization schedules with both monovalent OMVs and HexaMen. Priming with two different weakly immunogenic PorAs followed by two doses of HexaMen, induced good responses against all serosubtypes. The early immune responses against a strong (P1.5-1,2-2) and a weak PorA immunogen (P1.7-,2 4) after monovalent immunization, revealed a delayed onset of high affinity IgG and SBA titers for the weak immunogen. A PorA-specific B cell ELISPOT showed that the lower IgG and SBA titers were not reflected by a lack of specific B cells or plasma cells, but were instead higher after the boost. Apparently, the P1.7-2,4 specific B cells have difficulties to generate high affinity antibodies and require more proliferation to obtain sufficient antibody production. This higher number of P1.7-2,4 specific memory B cell pool remained constant for over a year. We also found that memory B cells were induced already after one HexaMen immunization, and were reactive upon both immunization and intranasal exposure to live bacteria, indicating that this memory B cell pool may contribute to vaccine-induced protection in the absence of PorA specific bactericidal titers. Finally, we studied the involvement of CD4 T cells in the PorA specific response by the generation of a PorA (P1.5-1,2-2) specific T cell hybridoma. The recognized epitope was located in a transmembrane region with limited strain variation. Still, one amino acid variation either inside or outside the CD4 T cell epitope could greatly reduce the efficiency of PorA specific CD4 T cell activation. In conclusion, a multivalent PorA OMV vaccine is to date the best vaccine to protect against meningococcal disease in an endemic situation. Differences in PorA specific immune responses are caused by intrinsic properties of PorA and the interaction with the complete immune system. Furthermore, our studies showed that the PorA specific immune responses may be enhanced by optimizing the vaccination schedule.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Strategies to reduce blood loss and transfusion of allogeneic blood products during surgery and following trauma are important in modern medicine. Therefore, it is desirable to reduce the use of homologous transfusions as much as possible. Furthermore, modern blood management strategies should incorporate not only red blood cell salvage but should also include the support of natural healing processes by using autologous prepared blood components, which can then be applied on (surgical) wounds. Various approaches have now been developed where whole blood platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and platelet-poor plasma (PPP) sequestration is used to provide pre-operative autologous blood component therapy. This technique has proved to reduce the number of allogeneic blood transfusions during open-heart surgery, as well as in orthopedic operations. Following the sequestration procedure, the prepared PRP and PPP blood components can be utilized to apply to tissues. Platelet-leukocyte gel is a substance containing of a mix of PRP, leukocytes, and thrombin, prepared from a unit of autologous freshly drawn whole blood. Platelet-leukocyte gel can either be applicated as a stand alone product, or can be added to autologous bone or bone substitutes, to create a \"bioactive\" bone graft. Thrombin will activate the PRP, inducing the platelet granules to release their platelet growth factors. Because of the high growth factor content, platelet-leukocyte gel is capable of executing the essential steps in wound healing by potentially increasing collagen production and improving the integrity of the wound repair. Moreover, platelet-leukocyte gel possesses antimicrobial effects, based on the release of antimicrobicidal proteins from platelet granules, along with functioning white blood cells. Few hospitals in Europe routinely use autologous platelet-leukocyte gel application techniques as part of a peri-operative blood management program. In the United States, an increasing number of clinicians tend to employ platelet-leukocyte gel applications in various surgical settings, for both in, and out of hospital surgery. The question of why this novel and promising technique for the delivery of autologous growth factors has not yet been adopted on a broader scale needs to be addressed. The main reason may be the lack of convincing scientific data that provides information whether or not the use of PRP and platelet-leukocyte gels are appropriate in the clinical setting. To date there have been no well-designed scientific studies in which platelet-leukocyte gel has been used during orthopedic indications. Although there have been anecdotal reports, there are clearly many important questions to be answered. The purpose of this thesis was to provide basic information on features which are important for the application of platelet-leukocyte gel, to overcome the conflicting data that have been reported in clinical studies and experimental research on the efficacy of platelet-leukocyte gel treatment. In-vitro, clinical, and experimental studies have been executed in order to provide this information. A good understanding of proper preparation techniques and application methods of autologous platelet growth factor delivery are mandatory to avoid inconsistent results in outcome'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['In areas with a high intrinsic contrast such as the chest, radiation dose can be reduced for specific indications. Low dose chest CT is feasible and cannot only be applied for lung cancer screening, but also in daily routine and for early detection of lung destruction. We showed in a small sample of patients from the outpatient department of pulmonology that ultralow-dose CT is feasible and can provide more information than CXR in two directions, while radiation dose is similar. The main disadvantage of radiation dose reduction is the accompanying increase in image noise. The detection of abnormalities with a high contrast to the surrounding normal tissue is not limited by the amount of image noise on the CT scans performed with the current minimum radiation dose. However, when the structure of interest shows a low contrast to the surrounding normal tissue, image noise can hamper the detection and especially the automated size measurement of the abnormality. We demonstrated that an increase in image noise results in overestimation of the emphysema score compared to standard dose CT, but also that the application of a dedicated noise reduction filter to the reconstructed data before the automated quantification of emphysema can prevent this overestimations. This thesis is partly based on the Dutch Belgian Lung Cancer Screening project (NELSON), a randomized multi-center trial studying current and former smokers in order to detect lung cancer in an early, treatable stage. The detection of growth is the main feature to distinguish benign non-calcified nodules from potentially benign ones, but interscan and to a lesser extent interobserver variability can limit the detection of growth. We showed that the performance of the algorithm to segment the nodule completely was the most important factor contributing to the variability. Since chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer share smoking as main risk factor, lung cancer screening trials provide a good opportunity to study the early stages and natural progression of COPD. Emphysema can cause COPD and can easily be detected and automated be quantified on CT by highlighting voxels with an abnormally low X-ray attenuation. We provided the limits of agreement for three common attenuation thresholds for emphysema scores obtained in a lung cancer screening setting. Moreover, we studied the prevalence of emphysema and airflow impairment in participants of the NELSON-project. Many participants showed destructed parenchyma, but a preserved lung function. However, the gas exchange is often already impaired in these subjects, but gas exchange is not one of the hallmarks of COPD (yet). The diffusion of DNO is shown to be a marker of vascular changes, which can precede macroscopic lung tissue destruction. We showed that DNO can be impaired before CT can detect emphysema. Furthermore, we showed that the distribution pattern of emphysema has an impact on the extent of airflow impairment. Current and former smokers with an apical predominance of emphysema showed more severe airflow limitation than subjects with an equal emphysema score, but a basal predominance of lung destruction.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Neuropathy associated with Diabetes is increasing at epidemic rates throughout the world. Traditionally, this neuropathy causes loss of protective sensation leading to ulceration, infection , and amputation. Even with good glycemic control, this neuropathy is still considered progressive and irreversible. In many patients with diabetic neuropathy there is also associated pain and loss of balance, requiring expensive neuropathic pain medication and treatment of hip and wrist fractures. In 1988, Dellon observed that therecould be a new optimism for this problem, because the metabolic neuropathy made the peripheral nerve susceptible to compression, which might be responsible for these clinical symptoms and sequelae. In 1992, Dellon published the first clinical research documenting that decompression of peripheral nerves at known sites of anatomic narrowing could relieve the symptoms of neuropathy and prevent ulcers and amputations. In this Thesis, the primary hypothesis tested is that the metabolic neuropathy of diabetes makes the peripheral nerve susceptible to nerve compression at known sites of anatomic compression, and that decompression of these superimposed compressions can relieve the symptoms and thereby alter the natural history of diabetic neuropathy. The basic animal science research models and anatomic investigations that form the basis for this clinical approach are described and their results documented. New clinical outcome studies are described and their results documented. The summary of this research is that: I) The ideal patient for surgical decompression of peripheral nerves who has diabetes is one who can have the degree of neuropathy documented and staged by neurosensory testing with the Pressure-Specified Sensory Device and one who has clinical evidence of nerve compression with a positive Tinel sign at known anatomic sites of narrowing; the common peroneal nerve at the fibular head, the deep peroneal nerve over the foot dorsum, and the branches of the tibial nerve in the four medial ankle tunnels. Furthermore, the patient should have sufficient blood supply to the foot and be without edema in the foot to permit satisfactory wound healing. II) Given the above inclusion criteria for surgery, it can be expected that there will be an 80% chance of relief of pain from an 8.5 to a 2.0 on a Visual Analog Scale within 3 months of surgery, and an 80% chance to improve sensibility significantly within one year after surgery. III). In the group of patients for whom sensibility is restored, the natural history of diabetic neuropathy will be changed such that there will be no ulcerations and no amputations. IV) In patients who have bilateral Dellon Triple Nerve Decompression surgery, balance will be improved minimizing the risk of fractures due to falls. It is concluded that patients with diabetes who have superimposed nerve compressions in the lower extremities can achieve relief of symptoms and prevention of ulceration and amputation by decompression of these multiple sites of nerve compression using the operative approaches described in this Thesis.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Polymorphous light eruption (PLE) is a photosensitivity disorder of which the pathogenesis is not fully understood. Patient history in PLE is important since lesions are transient and often not present at time of consultation. Phototesting is done to reproduce the PLE skin lesions and to obtain information about the responsible action spectrum and the UV dose necessary to elicit skin lesions. However, phototesting is a time consuming procedure. Therefore, we wondered whether it would be possible to assess severity of disease based on the patient history alone. In chapter 2, we showed that the severity assessment in PLE based on patient history did not correlate with the severity as assessed by phototesting. Furthermore, many different phototesting protocols exist, resulting in very different success rates. In chapter 3, it was demonstrated that a maximum of 4 daily irradiations using UVA and UVB light sources is suitable and optimal for diagnostic phototesting in the majority of the PLE patients. More extensive test protocols have no clinical implications, however less extensive protocols may lead to substantial loss of positive test results. PLE lesions can be visible even within a few hours after UV exposure. Therefore, we hypothesized that an early induced mechanism is responsible for the initiation of PLE. In chapter 4, we showed that in PLE patients significantly less neutrophils infiltrate the skin at 18 h after 3 MED UVB irradiation compared with healthy controls, most probably due to local and not systemic pathomechanisms. The intrinsic chemotactic capacity of neutrophils, as well as the expression pattern of cell surface receptors, was similar in PLE patients and healthy controls, indicating that the reduced neutrophil infiltration in PLE skin is most probably not caused by an impaired function of circulating neutrophils. In chapter 5, sequential changes in mRNA regulating a broad spectrum of proteins involved in UV-induced inflammation of the skin in the first 18 hours after UVB exposure were found. After a single dose of 3 MED UVB, a gene specific expression time-dependency was observed in skin of PLE patients and healthy controls. At 3 and 6 h after UVB irradiation, no distinctive early mRNA expression pattern between PLE patients and healthy controls was shown. However, 18 h after UVB exposure, PLE patients showed a significantly increased mRNA expression of ICAM-1, CD25 and FOXP3 compared with healthy controls. Furthermore, we found that the expression of IL-1β was decreased in unirradiated skin of PLE patients. The increased mRNA expression of CD25 and FOXP3 suggests that T-cells expressing a regulatory phenotype play a role during the early phase of the UVB-induced response in PLE patients. Cis-urocanic acid (UCA) is present in the UV-exposed skin and has immunosuppressive properties. In chapter 6, we observed that PLE patients have significantly increased amounts of total- and trans-UCA in unirradiated buttock skin. After UVB irradiation significantly increased concentrations of trans- and cis-UCA were found in the skin of PLE patients. We hypothesized that the increase in cis-UCA might be responsible for a decreased neutrophil skin infiltration after UVB.'],\n",

In addition we analysed possible determinants of cognitive functioning in patients with TSC. Genotype (different TSC1 and TSC2 mutations, tuber status and epilepsy variables were related to cognitive functioning. We found a statistically significantly lower cognition index in patients with a TSC2 mutation, but the overlap was considerable. A higher proportion of brain volume occupied by tubers was related to a lower intelligence equivalent and tended to be related to a lower cognition index. In a multivariable analysis age at seizure onset was identified as the only independent predictor of cognitive functioning. To date there is no strategy available to prevent seizure onset, prompting adequate treatment as soon as seizures occur. Epilepsy surgery is often not considered in patients with TSC as epileptogenicity from one tuber to another is feared. We found that patients with consistent localisation of interictal epileptiform EEG activity are characterised by an older at seizure onset, less often infantile spasms or generalised tonic clonic seizures, and a higher intelligence equivalent when compared to patients with inconsistent foci. Before epilepsy surgery can be performed the identification of the epileptogenic tuber is a prerequisite. Both magnetoencephalography (MEG) and diffusion weighted MRI (DWI) contributed significantly to the selection of TSC patients for epilepsy surgery. We found that MEG sources were closer to presumed epileptogenic tubers (mean distance of 13.8 mm) than EEG sources (mean distance of 24.7 mm) and MEG more often revealed unifocal epileptiform activity. Further, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps of four epileptogenic tubers (mean 1099 mm/s, SD 35.0) were statistically significantly higher than that of 18 non-epileptogenic tubers (mean 926 mm/s, SD 69.4) and of 16 regions of normal appearing cortex (mean 784 mm/s, SD 61.7). A systematic literature study on seizure outcome after epilepsy surgery in patients with TSC and multi-drug resistant epilepsy revealed that seizure freedom was achieved in 101 (57%) of the 177 included patients, from 25 studies. Seizure frequency was reduced by > 90% in another 32 patients (18%). Moderate or severe intellectual disability (defined as IQ <70) (RR 1.8; 95% CI 1.2- 2.8) and the presence of tonic seizures (RR 1.7; 95 % CI 1.2- 2.4) were related to seizure recurrence. Subsequently, we evaluated presurgical investigations in 25 Dutch TSC patients with multi-drug resistant epilepsy in whom epilepsy surgery was considered. Suitable candidates were identified by one region of seizure onset, or sufficient seizure burden. Six patients underwent epilepsy surgery. Four of these patients had excellent outcome. Differential accumulation of hamartin and tuberin in separate cellular compartments was found in giant cells of a resected epileptogenic tuber. An alternative mechanism for tuberogenesis is suggested by prevention of formation of the hamartin-tuberin complex and as a result increased S6 phosphorylation.'],\n",

Chiari-like malformation is a condition where the brain is too big for the skull and is crushed and pushed out the foramen magnum. This obstructs the flow of cerebrospinal fluid in and out of the head. A consequence of this is that fluid accumulates within the spinal cord forming cavities termed syringomyelia (SM). This fluid often collects in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord - an important area for collating information about pain sensation. The damage can result in signs of severe pain. As the dogs with this condition are a natural occurring example of a disease which also occurs in humans, finding new and effective ways of managing this pain will be relevant for both human and canine sufferers. CM/SM is inherited in the CKCS - as many as 50% have the condition and approximately 35% of affected dogs have clinical signs of pain. Part on the ongoing work in this study is the identification of the genes responsible for CM/SM.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['MRI-based Assessment of Endovascular Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair'],\n",
       "  'Description': [\"Imaging techniques play a key role in the Endovascular Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair (EVAR) follow-up. The most important parameters monitored after EVAR are the aneurysm size and the presence of endoleaks. Currently, computed tomographic angiography (CTA) is the most commonly used imaging modality for EVAR follow-up. Important advantages of CTA are its wide availability and relatively low costs. The most important disadvantages are the need for ionizing radiation and iodinated contrast agent. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) have been advocated as promising alternatives to CTA for post-EVAR follow-up. MRI-techniques have evident theoretical advantages over CTA examination. Especially the high soft tissue contrast of MRI and the high sensitivity for non-nephrotoxic contrast agent give MRI an advantage over CTA evaluation. The research described in this thesis was conducted to evaluate MRI and Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) techniques as an alternative to CTA in the follow-up of patients after EVAR, by comparing findings on MRI examination with those obtained in the same patients using CTA. The additional value of MRI's superior soft tissue contrast was also investigated. In order to address the issue of metal artifacts, seven of the most commonly used endografts were evaluated as to their suitability for MRI-based follow-up. Most metallic endo- or exoskeletons of endovascular grafts do not interfere with diagnostic imaging. Skeletons made out of Stainless steel however resulted in large artifacts making diagnostic evaluation impossible. We showed that with a dedicated MRI protocol, MRI is more sensitive for endoleak detection than CT is. We also showed that the addition of time-resolved or dynamic MRA increases MRI's accuracy for determining the origin of inflow of an endoleak. Furthermore, the additional information MRI inherently offers about thrombus composition cannot be obtained using CT. The exact processes taking place inside the aneurysm sac after exclusion from blood flow by placement of an endoprosthesis are not well understood. In the case of stable or non-shrinking aneurysms, it is important to know the etiology of non-shrinkage for rupture risk estimation and for treatment decisions. A newly developed method for evaluation of thrombus organization as a parameter for follow-up after EVAR was developed and tested. This method involves the classification of voxels based upon their relative signal intensity using manually set thresholds. Voxels are classified into tree groups; endoleak, fresh thrombus and old thrombus. It is demonstrated that new parameters describing aneurysm sac contents may provide additional information in EVAR follow-up. As expressed by several authors in the literature on EVAR follow-up, there is still a quest for the best set of parameters to be followed after EVAR: diameter change, volume change, the presence of endoleak, pressure inside the aneurysm, aneurysm wall motion or graft wall motion. Until now, each single parameter only offers part of the necessary information. Only long-term studies will be able to clarify what the essential parameters for follow-up after EVAR are and how they should be interpreted.\"],\n",

       "  'Description': ['This thesis investigated the gene expression in bovine oocytes during meiotic resumption, at 6 h post LH surge, coinciding with germinal vesicle breakdown, which was supposed to give a picture of the major cell cycle regulation changes, cytoskeleton rearrangement and chromosome alignment. Presumptive competent oocytes were used to construct and hybridize the DNA microarray using Suppression Subtraction Hybridization (SSH), to unravel the potential transcripts involved in meiotic resumption and possibly developmental competence. The mRNA expression of several genes was further studied using quantitative real-time PCR. The roles of these genes during maturation have not been entirely characterized, but the results presented in this thesis will support the establishment of new hypothesis regarding the resumption of meiotic arrest in bovine oocytes and provide useful information for the development of efficient maturation media for in vitro embryo production. In this Thesis, we used also oocytes collected from cows stimulated with FSH classified as deviant and normal based on the steroid hormones profile, and oocytes collected from slaughterhouse ovaries and matured in vitro, to investigate whether the divergent culture conditions is accompanied by altered mRNA levels of the different selected genes playing important roles in organelles translocation and spindle integrity and formation using real-time PCR. The analysis of six mRNAs suggested that both the exogenous FSH induced intrafollicular environment and in vitro maturation and culture conditions may affect the developmental competence by affecting the expression of these genes. mRNAs representing the major metabolic pathways involved in lipid metabolism were also investigated in this thesis using normal in vivo matured oocytes.The results, provide new information regarding long chain fatty acid transport into the oocytes and regulation of energy requirement during maturation and blastocyst stage using lipid as a substrate. Furthermore, the aberrant expression of lipid metabolism mRNAs levels in the oocyte matured in vitro, as well as that in deviant oocyte from stimulated cows, in addition to that in the in vitro produced blastocysts suggests a defect in fatty acid metabolism. This thesis has revealed many of the new basic properties of the mammalian oocyte, and based on this information a plausible model for regulation of meiotic resumption and proper oocyte function is possible.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Cytomegalovirus-induced destruction of MHC class I molecules provides insight into ER-associated protein degradation'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['In living cells, proteins are produced continuously. To carry out its specific functions, proteins need to be correctly folded. Proteins that are secreted or function in the cell membrane are folded in a specialized compartment in the cell, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The production of proteins is not free of error. To ensure that only properly folded proteins or protein complexes exit the ER to their destinations, a quality control system is in place. Proteins that are misfolded are recognized in the ER, moved from the ER into the cytosol and marked with a small protein called ubiquitin. This tag can be recognized by a large protein complex called the proteasome, which degrades the tagged misfolded protein. The ER quality control system plays an important role in diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, diabetes and cystic fibrosis. Besides its importance in the disposing of misfolded proteins, the ER quality control system is also involved in the persistent infection of some viruses such as HIV and HCMV. The human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) causes a persistent infection and is present in 80% of the world population. It manifests itself mainly when the immune system is weakened, for example in AIDS patients. Normally, parts of the infecting virus are presented on the cell surface by the MHC class I complex for immune surveillance. Immune cells can recognize an infected cell and then respond by destroying both the cell and the virus within. HCMV, however, can evade detection by the immune system by targeting part of the MHC class I complex for degradation. This prevents the viral peptides from being presented on the cell surface, and thus detection. In this thesis, the degradation of MHC class I molecules is used as a model system for degradation of misfolded ER proteins. We found that the role of ubiquitin is essential in this process. Ubiquitin can be linked together to itself via internal lysine residues forming a polyubiquitin chain. We found that a specific Lys48 lined polyubiquitin chain is required for the retro-translocation of MHC class I heavy chains from the ER into the cytosol. This movement requires energy and it is likely that a protein complex recognizes the polyubiquitin chain and pulls it out of the ER membrane, before it is targeted to the proteasome for degradation. Insight in ER-associated degradation as described here may lead to the development of drugs to treat viral infections or diseases such cystic fibrosis or diabetes.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['In response to hypoxia during tumor growth, a number of genetic changes are induced that allow the cancer cells to survive. These changes are orchestrated by the Hypoxia Inducible Factors (HIFs), respectively HIF-1alpha, HIF-2alpha and HIF-3alpha. HIF-1alpha is the main regulator of this response and can initiate the switch to glycolysis, angiogenesis and invasion. As a consequence, for most solid tumors including the Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM), a high expression of HIF-1alpha and its target genes such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is correlated with a worse prognosis. In order to establish the role of these factors in the formation of GBM, astrocytes lacking HIF-1alpha or VEGF, were implanted in the flank and brain of immunocompromised mice. When grown in the flank, loss of HIF-1alpha reduced tumor growth. In contrast, tumor formation by these cells was not reduced when grown in the brain. In both locations, loss of HIF-1alpha impaired angiogenesis. This was not a disadventage when grown in the brain; in this highly vascular organ the HIF-1alpha null cells grew around the existing blood vessels and thus survived. This was not possible in the relatively vessel poor area of the flank, resulting therefore in a reduced tumor growth in this location. An increased expression of the HIFs and their target genes is also detected in tumors formed as a result of loss of the negative HIF regulator, the Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene. In order to determine how these factors contribute to tumor formation mediated by loss of VHL, astrocytes lacking VHL alone, or in combination with either HIF-1alpha or VEGF, were grown in the flank and brain of mice. Tumor growth as a result of loss of VHL was independent of HIF-1alpha. Loss of VEGF impaired VHL mediated tumor growth only in the flank and not in the brain, indicating that VEGF is not an essential growth factor in cancer associated with VHL disease. HIF-1alpha is required for the switch to glycolysis, and cells grown under hypoxia are sensitized to inhibitors of this pathway, such as 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG). To test whether cells that show an increased expression of HIF-1alpha are also sensitized to 2DG, VHL null astrocytes were exposed to 2DG both during cell culture and when grown as tumors in mice. In cell culture, astrocytes lacking VHL showed an increased growth inhibition when exposed to 2DG, but this effect was not recapitulated when the same cells were grown in the flank of mice. Targeting the glycolytic or hypoxic pathway seems an attractive method to reduce tumor growth. As described in this thesis however, depending on the organ in which the cells are grown, unexpected mechanisms can be activated which can reduce the potency of such inhibitors.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['AD skin is characterized by the infiltration of CD4+ T cells in the dermis and epidermis. Chemokines (chemoattracting cytokines), including TARC and CTACK play a pivotal role in the recruitment of T cells to the skin of AD patients. In chapter two we describe that the serum levels of chemokines TARC and CTACK are increased in AD patients compared to patients with allergic asthma and healthy controls. In addition we show that the serum levels correlate to disease severity. We put serum TARC levels forward as an objective parameter for disease severity.\\r\\nWhen other treatments fail, patients with severe refractory AD are regularly being treated with cyclosporin A (CsA). In chapter three we show that CsA treatment is highly effective and relatively safe, with regard to the most common side effects, including increased blood pressure and renal toxicity. However, patients regularly experience a relapse after discontinuation of therapy. In addition, in chapter four we describe a small subset of AD patients that experience an exacerbation during CsA treatment with signs and symptoms more severe than at onset of treatment. Increasing total serum IgE levels were found to parallel these exacerbations of eczema. Increasing IgE production had previously been described using in vitro experiments. We hypothesize that in this subset of AD patients CsA induces a shift towards Th2, resulting in increased IgE synthesis.\\r\\nIn order to study the in vivo effects of CsA treatment, in chapter five we performed a detailed study of the effects of CsA treatment on peripheral blood T cell subsets with a focus on regulatory T cells (Tregs). We show that CsA treatment significantly reduces the percentage of Tregs. In addition, it was found that CsA treatment decreases the expressions of genes FOXP3 and GADD45A, involved in T cell regulation.\\r\\nUsing a microarray approach we have found several genes that are suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of AD. Chapter six describes two groups of genes found differentially expressed in CD4+ T cells from AD patients compared to allergic asthma patients and healthy control subjects. The first group included genes involved in migration of T cells to the skin, a second group of genes was related to T cell survival. In chapter seven we examined the expression of these genes in the preferentially skin homing, CLA-positive T cell population. These skin homing T cells were found to show decreased expression of apoptosis related genes, suggesting their increased survival potential in patients with AD.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Most studies after disasters have focused on mental health problems such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and anxiety among survivors. Besides mental health problems, survivors may develop physical health symptoms that are frequently unexplained such as headache, fatigue and stomachache as a result of the traumatic event. To date, these symptoms have not often been studied after disasters. The studies described in this thesis examine symptoms that are frequently medically unexplained among residents affected by the Enschede fireworks disaster. As a result of the explosion of a fireworks depot in a residential area in Enschede, the Netherlands, 23 persons were killed, more than 900 people were injured and about 1200 people were forced to relocate because their houses were destroyed or severely damaged. After this disaster, a longitudinal study of the health consequences of the disaster was started. The study consisted of a 3-wave longitudinal health survey that was performed three weeks (wave 1), 18 months (wave 2) and almost 4 years (wave 3) after the disaster. In addition to this longitudinal health survey, the electronic medical records (EMRs) of general practitioners (GPs) were used to study changes in health problems among survivors. The main objectives of this thesis were 1) to examine the prevalence of symptoms among survivors of disasters, 2) to explore risk factors for these symptoms among survivors and 3) to investigate whether self-reported symptoms show similarities with medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) that are presented to the GP. A review of the literature showed that the prevalence rate of self-reported symptoms was elevated among survivors of different kinds of disasters. Among the survivors of the fireworks disaster, the level of self-reported symptoms was higher compared to controls up to four years after the disaster. Besides this, the mean number of symptoms presented to the GP was higher in the two years after the disaster compared to the year prior to the disaster. We identified several important risk factors for symptoms among survivors such as female gender, immigrant status and psychological problems. The risk factors for physical symptoms among survivors were comparable with the risk factors for MUS in the general population. In addition, the results showed several similarities between the self-reported symptoms and MUS presented to the GP such as associated functional impairment and a higer level of illness behavior. Several methodological issues, such as the design, selective response and possible bias are discussed. Besides this, the advantages and disadvantages of the use of questionnaires and EMRs in epidemiological studies after disasters are discussed. The findings indicate that elevation of physical symptoms are part of the distress reaction following traumatic exposure. For that reason, it is recommended to measure these symptoms in studies after disasters. Also, since the self-reported symptoms showed several similarities with MUS, it can be concluded that questionnaires can be used to measure physical symptoms that are frequently unexplained.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Ketamine is frequently used in both human and veterinary anaesthesia. Beside its anaesthetic and analgesic effects, ketamine has been demonstrated to possess anti-inflammatory properties in rodents and humans. To date, no data are available on the anti-inflammatory effects of ketamine in horses. This thesis summarises experimental work conducted into the anti-inflammatory effects of ketamine in different in vitro and in vivo equine models. In an equine bone-marrow-derived macrophage cell line (e-CAS cells), ketamine significantly suppressed lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-6 concentrations in a concentration-dependent manner (0-36 microM). Characterisation of the molecular mechanism underlying this cytokine-modulating activity revealed that ketamine inhibited LPS-induced cytokine production by directly inhibiting the nuclear transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B). Next to cytokines, NF-kappa B is known to be involved in the transcription of enzymes such as cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), which account for many of the clinical symptoms associated with inflammatory responses. Although ketamine significantly inhibited LPS-induced NF-kappa B expression, no effect on COX-2 and iNOS expression could be demonstrated. Inhibiton experiments showed that this lack of effect is most likely contributed to the fact that LPS-induced COX-2 and iNOS expression are mainly regulated by another signal transduction pathway, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, which itself is not affected by ketamine. In contrast to these results, ketamine significantly reduced the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in e-CAS cells following co-stimulation with LPS and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). The finding that ketamine reduced cytokine production and ROS formation in LPS-treated e-CAS cells indicates that ketamine has cytokine-modulating effects in vivo. Considering the concentration-dependency and the finding that elevated plasma cytokine levels have been detected in horses for several hours after onset of inflammation, it was hypothesised that ketamine may need to be administered for a prolonged period of time and at relatively high dose rates to be clinically effective in modulating inflammatory mediators. A pharmacodynamic study showed that a ketamine CRI of 1.5 mg/kg/h can safely be administered to conscious healthy horses for at least 6 h. To evaluate the cytokine-modulating effects of this ketamine CRI in vivo, a tissue chamber model was used. In LPS-inoculated tissue chambers in Shetland ponies, ketamine did not exhibit cytokine-modulating or antioxidative properties, which can be explained by the rapid biotransformation and elimination of ketamine as well as the limited affinity to proteins, thus preventing adequate accumulation of ketamine in the inflamed tissue chambers. However, the observed anti-inflammatory properties of ketamine in vitro still justify further research into the anti-inflammatory effects of ketamine in horses suffering from inflammatory disorders.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The transition of an intestinal epithelial cell into a fully transformed, metastatic cancer cell requires mutations in multiple proto-oncogenes and key tumor suppressor genes, including those of the Wnt pathway. We describe a large scale analysis of the downstream genetic program activated by wnt signaling through β-catenin/TCF4 in colorectal cancer cells. Inhibition of wnt signaling in these cells results in a growth arrest with downregulation of genes expressed in the proliferating region of the crypt while forcing these cells into a differentiation program. These results were confirmed by immunohistochemistry on adenomas and early neoplastic lesions in the intestine. This study validated the disruption of the β-catenin/TCF complex as a therapeutic strategy to revert the transformed phenotype in colorectal cancer. Silencing genes that contribute to the survival and progression of tumor cells is a major research objective. Recently RNAi technology for gene knockdown in mammalian cells has been proven to be effective. We describe the generation of a doxycycline-inducible version of a Polymerase III H1-RNA gene promoter driven shRNA vector (pTER). The knockdown of β-catenin/TCF activity by a loss-of-function approach reproduced the phenotypic changes that occur in CRC cells described earlier. This inducible pTER vector is particularly useful for the analysis of genes which functions are difficult to evaluate due to effects on growth or differentiation of cells, like cell-cycle regulators, oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes and genes that control apoptosis. DNA array techniques are rapidly evolving and genome-wide oligonucleotide array platforms are now common use, containing up to 55000 probes. We analyzed the expression profile of LS174 CRC cells stably transfected with inducible dnTCF1 and dnTCF4. The 300-400 selected Wnt responsive genes were subsequently compared to the gene profile of adenomas and adenocarcinomas versus normal colonic epithelium. These genes could be divided into 3 groups based on differential expression in distinct parts of the crypts. Our data demonstrate that in one organ system, the gut, different transcriptional outputs of Wnt signalling correspond with the proposed Wnt functions of maintaining the crypt progenitor phenotype, driving the terminal differentiation of Paneth cells and stem cell renewal, respectively. Mash-2 one of the identified target genes was studied more extensively. In the normal intestine, Mash-2 is expressed at the position of the presumptive crypt stem cell. No Mash-2 expression was found in the TCF4 KO mice and in adenomas of APCmin mice Mash-2 is highly expressed. This confirmed the observation that Mash-2 is indeed a target of the Wnt pathway. To further define the contribution of Mash-2 to the Wnt dependent phenotype in the gut, we generated a Villin-Mash-2-transgenic mouse. Overexpression of Mash-2 in the intestine correlated with overexpression of few wnt target genes implicated in proliferation and in stem cell maintenance, making Mash-2 a possible stem cell regulator. The results described in this thesis has further increased our knowledge of the role of the Wnt pathway. This may be a basis for the ongoing efforts for the development of drugs targeting the inhibition of the Wnt pathway.'],\n",

The first published mid-term results of aneurysm repair with fenestrated and branched endografts from a European center of excellence is described in Chapter 2. The use of fenestrated and branched devices for difficult re-operative aortic surgery as a salvage procedure was examined in Chapter 3.\\r\\n\\n These two clinical trials revealed new complications specific to fenestrated and branched devices. For example, fractured or bent side-branches and occluded renal branch vessels were observed. The potential of repeated dynamic stresses related to the cardiac cycle was postulated as a source of the problems. The dynamic effect of placing a relatively stiff endograft into a compliant, pulsatile aorta was examined in Chapter 4 through EKG-gated cine CTA. The cardiac based dynamics of the aorta was confirmed in a separate cohort of patients in Chapter 5 using the different modality of EKG-gated cine MRA. Furthermore, stent-graft design specific differences in compliance of the aorta and endograft were noted following EVAR.\\r\\n\\n The renal arteries are the most commonly preserved aortic branch vessels using a fenestrated or branched technique. Furthermore, the complications identified in the fenestrated and branched clinical papers were typically related to the renal arteries. Therefore, we focused our attention on the effects of EVAR on renal artery motion in Chapter 6. Based on earlier work noting differences in stent-graft design on aortic dynamics, we evaluated the effect of three stent-graft designs (infra-re-nal fixation, supra-renal fixation, and branched) on renal artery motion in Chapter 7.  \\r\\n\\n Clinicians are increasingly placing thoracic endografts for 'off-label' indications such as traumatic aortic rupture in an effort to provide a less invasive and more effective treatment for these seriously injured poly-trauma patients. Chapter 8 is a systematic analysis of anatomic factors which may predict the rare, potentially devastating complication of thoracic endoprosthesis collapse.\\r\\n\\n Based in part on dynamic CT imaging of thoracic endoprosthesis collapse outlined in Chapter 8, an examination of normal descending aortic pulsatility was undertaken. The results are presented in Chapter 9 and provide insight into the local environment into which these thoracic stent-grafts are being placed. Chapter 10 provides a summary of the most important findings.\"],\n",

       "  'Description': ['This dissertation aimed to evaluate broiler susceptibility to colibacillosis and the potential of genetic selection to reduce broiler susceptibility to colibacillosis. A challenge experiment with E. coli at 7 days of age was carried out on eight broiler genotypes: five pure broiler lines, a slow\\xadgrowing line, and two 2\\xadway crosses of the pure\\xadlines. Based on the results from this experiment, a sensible definition of the susceptibility to colibacillosis was defined, and the indication of genetic variation in the susceptibility was found, suggesting that selection for reduced susceptibility is possible. Maternal antibodies did not have an effect on susceptibility, but there were indications of genetic variation in the changes in thyroid hormones in response to challenge as well as in the antibody response to challenge. Difficulties in evaluating immunological variables hinder attempts to improve animal health through selection on immunological variables. A model was developed that describes immunocompetence development as well as kinetics of immunoresponsiveness to a pathogenic challenge in an individual chick. This model provides a useful tool in the definition of appropriate challenge and measurement strategies when evaluating immunocompetence and immunoresponsiveness. The model was expanded into a stochastic model that describes a population of individual chicks with variation among them as well as stochastic variation within individuals across age. The model predicts that heteroscedasticity in variance across age decreases with increasing challenge age, and that minimum probability to detect a given difference in immunocompetence or responsiveness at another age than the selection age increases with increasing selection age. Therefore, a high challenge age, at which maternal immunity no longer has influence, is preferable. Selection against susceptibility to colibacillosis should aim at reducing the incidence of colibacillosis at commercial broiler level and be based on a combination of information on indicator and clinical traits. Because the economic importance of bacterial diseases as a whole is much higher than that of colibacillosis alone, changing the breeding goal to reducing the incidence of bacterial diseases as a whole is sensible.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Unravelling disease mechanisms in juvenile dermatomyositis'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['The pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases remains largely obscure despite extensive research. The role of triggering factors in the onset is unquestionable. However, at present, the focus of research lies in the mechanisms that locally control immune responses. Especially, enforcing the induction of regulatory T cells by self-antigens that are involved in the ongoing inflammation opens the way for new forms of specific immunotherapy. In this thesis, we aimed at exploring the mechanisms related to the ongoing inflammation in juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) as a model for autoimmune disease. JDM is a multisystem inflammatory disease that involves primarily the muscle and skin, but may affect many other systems We describe the spectrum of the disease, with emphasis on indicators for disease prognosis and new instruments to evaluate disease activity. These parameters are warranted for optimal choice of treatment regimens. Because disease prognosis and disease activity are correlated with the extent of the inflammatory process, underlying immunological mechanisms contributing to disease were analyzed. We focussed on regulatory T cells (Treg) as main players in peripheral tolerance. We were able to describe the characteristics of Treg in JDM and found possible clues pointing at impaired Treg function. The selection of heat shock proteins (HSP) as the self-antigens possibly involved in the inflammatory process was made because of their specific characteristics and because of the results of previous research in other autoimmune diseases. We showed that HSP60 and HSP60 epitopes can induce T cell regulation in vitro in JDM. In this disease, to our knowledge, no previous studies on these subjects were presented. Interestingly, HSP70 did not seem to induce adaptive immune responses. On the other hand, overexpression of HSP70 at the inflammatory site can be regarded as a sign of protection against further damage. Because immune reactivity to the HSP60 epitopes is also demonstrated in other autoimmune diseases, these epitopes could be related to inflammation in general and thus be applied in a broader patient population. T cell responses to HSP60 epitopes could also be used as biomarkers for disease activity and prognosis or for follow-up of future immunotherapy studies with epitopes. Altogether, this thesis offers intriguing new insights in the pathogenesis of an autoimmune disease that lacks an adequate animal model for thorough research. It is of importance to confirm our findings in a larger group of JDM patients which, because of the rarity of these diseases, necessitates a multicenter approach.'],\n",

       "  'Description': [\"Growing up with short stature. Psychosocial consequences of hormone treatment To enhance height in children with short stature, growth hormone (GH) can be used. In short children without a detectable pathology underlying their short stature, there is no medical rationale for growth hormone treatment. In order to justify this treatment in short but otherwise healthy children, it is to be shown that being short is associated with psychosocial problems and that hormone treatment improves psychosocial functioning. In adolescence, better effects on height are expected when growth hormone is combined with a puberty delaying hormone (Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone Agonist, GnRHa). The administration of this hormone makes the evaluation of the psychosocial effects the more important, as pubertal development is temporarily arrested in adolescents who are already disadvantaged because of their height. This thesis examines psychosocial consequences of hormone treatment in short but healthy children. The literature regarding the psychosocial impact of idiopathic short stature (ISS) and effects of hormone treatment on psychosocial functioning in children with ISS was reviewed and discussed. From the literature review it can be concluded that medically referred children with ISS are a subgroup of short children with, on average and according to their parents, more psychosocial problems than their taller peers and than short children who never visited a pediatrician. Psychosocial adaptation probably depends on the presence or absence of risk- and protective factors, but this has hardly been studied. The literature does not provide evidence that GH treatment, which leads to moderate and variable height gain, improves psychosocial functioning in children with ISS. The psychosocial consequences of combined GH and GnRHa treatment in 38 adolescents with ISS or persistent short stature born small for gestational age (SGA) was prospectively examined in a randomized controlled trial. Before GH/GnRHa treatment, the adolescents with ISS or SGA reported normal psychosocial functioning, whereas the parents reported worries about their children's current behavior or future chances in finding a spouse or a proper job. During three years of treatment, indications for some adverse psychosocial consequences in the treated adolescents were found. This suggests that it is useful to monitor psychosocial functioning during a combined GH/GnRHa treatment in adolescents with ISS or SGA. In young adulthood, both treated and untreated participants showed normal psychosocial functioning compared to Dutch population norms. Height gain was on average 2.3 centimeters more for the treated than for the untreated group. It can be concluded that, in the long term and independent of hormone treatment, adequate psychosocial adjustment is expected in case of short stature. The results of this thesis plead against hormone treatment in short normal adolescents. If in the future hormone treatment will lead to more height gain, making a decision for this treatment in an individual child will be a matter of weighing the pros and cons. It is worthwhile to consider psychosocial interventions instead of or as an adjunct to hormone treatment.\"],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Patients with schizophrenia are known to be impaired in several domains of emotional processing. These deficits have been associated with impaired social functioning. Since female patients show better social skills than male patients and healthy women outperform men in emotion recognition and empathic capacity, studying sex differences in emotional processing might contribute to a better understanding of the differences between men and women in the clinical manifestation of the illness. To this end, sex differences were studied in facial emotion recognition, emotion recognition in prosody and semantics of spoken language; empathy and perception of social interaction; working memory in simultaneous and sequential processing of language and emotion; long-term memory for visual information with positive, negative and neutral content; sensitivity to threat (inhibition) and reward (activation) in relationship to heartmeasures. The female advantage in emotion recognition, empathy and social perception was found to be preserved in schizophrenia. In addition, men but not women with schizophrenia were significantly impaired in performing a simultaneous language/emotion working memory task. These findings may explain in part the better course and outcome of female patients with schizophrenia. However, in more complex sequential or long-term processing of (emotional) stimuli, no female advantage was observed. Regarding inhibition, both male and female patients showed enhanced sensitivity to threat. Given the impaired performance in patients on all tasks involving emotional stimuli, our results confirm the accumulating evidence that schizophrenia is pre-eminently an emotional disorder.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['The transcription factor myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2) in cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['The heart responds to stress signals by hypertrophic growth, which is the first step towards heart failure (HF). The genetic pattern underlying HF remains largely elusive. Although the transcription factor Myocyte Enhancer Factor-2 (MEF2) is known to be a common endpoint for several hypertrophic signaling pathways, its precise role in myocardial remodeling is unknown. To this end, we pursued comprehensive gain- and loss-of-function approaches for MEF2 transcriptional activity in heart muscle in vitro and in vivo. We generated transgenic mice overexpressing MEF2 in the heart, which resulted in HF. In line, adenoviral delivery of MEF2 to cultured cardiomyocytes induced myocyte elongation, myofibril degeneration, and redistribution of focal adhesions, as seen in failing hearts. We also generated mice expressing a dominant negative form of MEF2 and crossed these mice with calcineurin transgenic mice, a model for cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. This did not prevent cardiac hypertrophy, but protected the mice from HF. To identify MEF2 target genes, we generated inducible stable cardiac cell lines, expressing the active form of MEF2, and performed microarray analysis. Functional clustering of MEF2 target genes revealed an overrepresentation of genes involved in cytoskeletal remodeling and cell-matrix adhesion. We describe myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (DMPK) as a direct transcriptional target for MEF2. By siRNA-mediated knockdown of DMPK expression, we demonstrate the involvement of this gene in the pathological aspects of MEF2 induced cardiomyocyte remodeling. Given the resemblance between MEF2 induced cardiac remodeling and the cardiac phenotype of mice lacking Muscle LIM Protein (MLP), an established mouse model for inherited dilated cardiomyopathy, we analyzed MEF2 transcription factor activity in MLP knockout mice by genetic crossbreeding with MEF2 reporter mice. Following confirmation that MEF2 activity was severely upregulated, we used conditional transgenesis to express a dominant-negative form of MEF2 (DNMEF2) in the murine MLP deficient heart and combined this with echocardiographic analysis to examine the effect on cardiac remodeling. Surprisingly, histological and functional analyses indicated that MEF2 inhibition in MLP knockout mice did not effect the genesis of dilated cardiomyopathy. Finally, the significance of MEF2 transcriptional activity was assessed in the setting of a more physiological model of biomechanical stress in the form of chronic murine pressure overload using conditional transgenesis to express a dominant-negative form of MEF2 (DNMEF2) in the postnatal heart. Surprisingly, echocardiography indicated that MEF2 inhibition did not improve end-diastolic and end-systolic ventricular dimensions and contractility as observed in calcineurin transgenic hearts with conditional MEF2 inhibition. In fact, cardiac function was significantly worsened in the setting of MEF2 inhibition, which could be correlated with specific defects in mitochondrial adaptation during pressure overload. Taken together, in this thesis we demonstrate that MEF2 activation in the heart does not evoke the classic hypertrophic response, yet promotes a gene program primarily involved in processes associated with dilated cardiomyopathy. Although MEF2 activation is required for maladaptive cardiac remodeling downstream of calcineurin signaling, its activity is not the sole trigger in certain forms of dilated cardiomyopathy, and is even necessary for the adaptive response of the heart during pressure overload.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Asymmetry in infancy : The effect of paediatric physical therapy on the course of deformational plagiocephaly and subsequent developmental delay'],\n",
       "  'Description': [\"Epidemiological studies have shown that prone and side sleeping is a major risk for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. Since the early nineties, concurrent with the increase in supine sleeping, consistent with the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations that healthy term infants should be positioned on their side or back to sleep, a rise in the prevalence of positional preference and deformational plagiocephaly has been observed. We presented a clinical flow chart showing different pathways in therapeutic strategies such as physical therapy, orthotic devices and surgery on the most occurring asymmetries in infancy (congenital muscular torticollis, positional torticollis and plagiocephaly) , based on best available evidence in current literature, in order to achieve uniformity in therapeutic thinking and performance. We investigated the psychometrical aspects of plagiocephalometry, a new instrument to assess and quantify the asymmetry of the skull. Using a thermoplastic material to mould the outline of the infant's skull, a reproduction of the skull shape is performed on paper allowing for accurate cephalometric measurements. We concluded that plagiocephalometry is an easy-to-apply, non-invasive, reliable and valid method to assess skull asymmetry with good clinical use and low application costs. Plagiocephalometry might serve as an instrument used in all levels of care for children with deformational plagiocephaly and might, by measurements over time, provide information concerning the natural course of deformational plagiocephaly as well as the assessment of the effects of conservative treatment strategies. We documented the prevalence of positional preference and deformational plagiocephaly at birth. We also studied prevalence changes over time until the age of seven weeks, and we identified risk factors that influence the occurrence and possible progression of deformational plagiocephaly. Three determinants were associated with an increased risk of deformational plagiocephaly at birth: male gender, birth rank first-born and brachycephaly. Deformational plagiocephaly at birth is not a predictor for deformational plagiocephaly at seven weeks of age. Deformational plagiocephaly at seven weeks of age was primarily caused by postnatal, external factors (nursing habits, positioning and care). Earlier achievement of motor milestones protects the child from developing deformational plagiocephaly. No significant association was found between supine sleeping and the development of positional preference and deformational plagiocephaly. A persistent restriction of the range of joint motion of the cervical spine associated with deformational plagiocephaly was not found. We investigated the effectiveness of a standardized paediatric physical therapy protocol on the occurrence and the course of positional preference and severe deformational plagiocephaly, assessed at seven weeks after birth (entry of the study) and at the age of six and twelve months. A four-month standardized paediatric physical therapy intervention program on children with positional preference significantly reduced the prevalence of severe deformational plagiocephaly compared to usual care. For children with deformational plagiocephaly and their parents, a careful multidisciplinary assessment and follow up program in child health care centres and paediatric physical therapy practices, based on updated protocols, clinical guidelines regarding positioning, handling and training of children with positional preference and with or without deformational plagiocephaly, are highly recommendable.\"],\n",

       "  'Title': ['The renal transcriptome in experimental hypertension'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['The renal transcriptome in experimental hypertension The kidneys importantly determine blood pressure. Kidney dysfunction can result in hypertension, which in turn leads to renal damage. In primary hypertension the cause is unknown. The condition is polygenic, however, which genetic defects cause elevated blood pressure remains obscure. Models of secondary hypertension have a known mono-causal pathogenesis. This thesis addresses primary and secondary hypertension in rats and mice and focuses on the renal cortical transcriptome (studied using microarrays) in relation to blood pressure. Three studies were performed on transcription modulation in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), a rat model for primary hypertension. First, renal cortical transcription was studied from newborn to old SHR and compared to normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats of the same ages. A number of persistent changes in renal gene expression was observed in SHR, but also a remarkable switch in the direction of altered expression of some genes in early life. Second, adult SHR were treated with several antihypertensive regimens. Mono-therapy with antihypertensive agents failed to normalize blood pressure. Angiotensin II (Ang II) AT1 receptor blocker, calcium channel inhibitor and two agents inhibiting oxidative stress caused quite distinct modulation of the renal cortical transcriptome. As a consequence, in the third study it was tested whether combining antihypertensive treatments led to a further decrease in blood pressure and to normalization of the renal cortical transcriptome in SHR towards WKY. This was indeed the case. Epoxide hydrolase 2 (Ephx2) that metabolizes the vasodilator epoxyeicosatrienoic acid, was consistently induced in renal cortex of SHR at all ages. Yet up till now Ephx2 has not been recognized as “hypertensive” gene in the rat because it does not lie within a so-called quantitative trait locus (QTL) for blood pressure. This illustrates the limitation of the QTL approach that by definition is determined by measurements of blood pressure. This is impossible in newborn and pre-weaning pups. Inhibiting Ephx2 in SHR during pregnancy and up to 4 weeks after birth revealed persistently lower blood pressure in female SHR up to 28 weeks of age compared to untreated SHR. In studies on secondary hypertension the vasoconstrictor Ang II was infused or synthesis of the vasodilator nitric oxide (NO) was inhibited for several weeks in wild-type mice or rats, respectively. Both treatments caused hypertension, however, renal damage only occurred in NO-depleted rats. The transcriptome in damaged and non-damaged kidneys did not reveal many candidates related to potentially damaging effects of Ang II or NO depletion, but rather revealed reduced synthesis of the protective antioxidants glutathione and bilirubin even before onset of renal damage. The thesis indicates the usefulness of genomics to study renal processes in genetic models of hypertension, both before onset of hypertension and when hypertension is manifest. Moreover, antihypertensive treatment responses in the kidneys were successfully analyzed. The studies underline the importance of antioxidants in renal protection against damaging effects of hypertension and suggest that combining antihypertensive agents not only further reduces blood pressure and the risk of end-organ damage but also lead to further normalization of the renal transcriptome.'],\n",

       "  'Description': [\"Dextran-based microspheres as controlled delivery systems for proteins Dextran based microspheres are investigated as controlled delivery system for proteins. Microspheres were prepared by polymerization of dex-HEMA in an aqueous two-phase system of dex-HEMA and PEG. Protein loaded microspheres are obtained by addition of proteins prior to polymerization. Due to the presence of hydrolytically sensitive carbonate ester groups linking HEMA to dextran, these gels degrade under physiological conditions gradually releasing the protein. In this thesis, several important aspects in the development of these dex-HEMA based microspheres as controlled delivery system of protein pharmaceuticals were investigated: (1) The in vitro in vivo correlation of a hydroxy ethyl methacrylated dextran (dex-HEMA) microsphere formulation. Therefore a controlled release formulation for human growth hormone (hGH) based dex-HEMA microsphere was developed and tested in preclinical and clinical studies. The results of those studies revealed that a strong correlation between in vitro release and pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic effects was obtained. (2) To obtain a a fundamental understanding, to optimize and to predict the release of proteins from dex-HEMA microspheres, a mathematical model was developed describing the mechanisms of protein release. The general effects of diffusion, crosslink density, protein loading, and clustering of proteins on the release were investigated. It was found that quantitative predictions of the release curves of BSA dimer, immunoglobulin G and hGH were possible. Therefore, this model may play an important role in the optimization, understanding and prediction of the release of various proteins from degradable hydrogels in general. (3) The effects of the initiator concentration, reaction temperature and pH on the mechanical properties of the microspheres were investigated. The results showed that higher initiator concentrations and a lower polymerization temperature resulted in a more rapid polymerization and a higher Young's modulus of the gels. This demonstrates that the network properties of dex-HEMA hydrogels and microspheres can be tailored by the polymerization conditions, which opens the possibility to modulate the release rate of entrapped compounds. (4) The possibility was investigated to modulate the encapsulation efficiency and release hGH-loaded dex-HEMA microspheres by using excipients. A biphasic release profile with delay time was observed for microspheres prepared without excipients, release profile without delay time was obtained for microspheres prepared with excipients. It was demonstrated that smaller hGH precipitates were formed in the presence of excipients, which explains the difference in protein release profiles of microspheres prepared with and without these additives. (5) The in vitro degradation of dex-HEMA microspheres was investigated by FT-IR, NMR, mass spectrometry, SEC analysis and XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy). It was found that in vitro degradation of dex-HEMA microspheres results in the formation of water-soluble degradation products (mainly dextran), leaving a small water-insoluble residue mainly consisting of pHEMA. (6) A series of dextrans with hydrophilic polymerizable groups were synthesized to investigate whether hydrogels based on these derivatized dextrans degrade under physiological conditions into fully water-soluble degradation products. It was demonstrated that the degradation of hydrogels based on the degradation of both macrogels and microspheres based on dex-(lac1,2-)HPMA resulted in the formation of only water-soluble degradation products. In conclusion, this thesis demonstrates that dextran based microspheres are attractive systems for the controlled release of pharmaceutically active proteins such as hGH.\"],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Oral anticoagulants of the coumarin type are effective drugs for the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic diseases. However, therapy with these drugs is complicated by their small therapeutic range and their substantial variability in anticoagulant response. In this thesis the influence of several drug interactions and two genetic factors on the variability in coumarin response has been examined. Coumarins are metabolised in the liver via the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP2C9, encoded by the homonymous gene CYP2C9. Several polymorphisms of this gene result in the production of an enzyme with decreased metabolic activity. In prospective follow-up studies we found that for acenocoumarol (231 patients) the possession of at least one CYP2C9*3 allele and for phenprocoumon (284 patients) the possession of at least one CYP2C9*2 or *3 allele was associated with 20-30 % lower dose requirements, with an increased risk of severe overanticoagulation and with a decreased chance to achieve a stable anticoagulation during a follow up time of maximally 6 months compared with patients with the normal CYP2C9*1/*1 genotype. The biological target of coumarins is the protein unit VKORC1, on the enzyme vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR), which is encoded by the homonymous gene VKORC1. In the above mentioned studies we also studied the effects of the frequently occurring C1173T polymorphism (> 40 % of Caucasian populations). In users of acenocoumarol the possession of a CYP2C9*2 or *3 allele together with the possession of a VKORC1 polymorphism was associated with severe overanticoagulation (3.8 times increased risk compared to patients with no or only one polymorphism). In users of phenprocoumon we found that the difference in dose requirements between carriers of a CYP2C9*2 or *3 variant allele and patients with the normal CYP2C9*1/*1 genotype was only significant among patients with the normal VKORC1 CC genotype, whereas these differences were smaller and largely not significant among carriers of a VKORC1 polymorphism. In patients using either acenocoumarol or phenprocoumon, the VKORC1 genotype explained a greater part of the variability in coumarin dose requirements than the CYP2C9 genotype. In a pharmacoeconomic study on the cost-effectiveness of CYP2C9 genotyping we found several scenarios in which genotyping preceding acenocoumarol therapy could be cost-effective compared with no genotyping. It is well known that coumarin anticoagulants are sensitive to coumarin interactions. In a prospective follow-up study with patients we found that management of the pharmacokinetic interaction of coumarins with the antibiotic co-trimoxazole by preventive or reactive dose reductions resulted in a significantly increased period of undertreatment during the first six weeks after the antibiotic course compared with several other frequently occurring antibiotics. In a case control study selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (antidepressants) appeared to increase the risk of major non-gastrointestinal bleeding, but not of gastrointestinal bleedings, among users of coumarins. Finally, we found in another case control study that the less extensively explored antiplatelet drugs clopidogrel and dipyridamole, next to the more extensively explored antiplatelet drug acetylsalicylic acid, increase the risk of major bleeding among users of coumarins.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Molecular epidemiology of Enterococcus faecium: from commensal to hospital adapted pathogen'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['For many years Enterococcus faecium was considered a commensal of the digestive tract, which only sporadically caused opportunistic infections in severely ill patients. Over the last two decades, vancomycin resistant E. faecium (VREF) has emerged worldwide as an important cause of nosocomial infections, especially in immunocompromised patients. The global VRE epidemic was preceded by the emergence of ampicillin resistant E. faecium (AREfm) in the United States in the early 1980s. Molecular epidemiological studies of both human- and animal-derived E. faecium isolates using multilocus sequence typing (MLST) revealed the existence of host specific genogroups, including a specific genetic lineage associated with hospital related isolates. These strains were characterized by ampicillin and quinolone resistance. In addition, the presence of the variant esp gene was strongly associated with these outbreak strains. In E. faecalis, esp is contained on a so-called pathogenicity island (PAI) and is considered a putative virulence factor. This thesis describes the development of a rapid and cheap identification scheme for enterococci, which is a prerequisite to take appropriate infection control measures. Furthermore, a rapid molecular typing scheme designated multiple locus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) has been developed to determine genetic relatedness of E. faecium isolates. Clustering of MLVA profiles confirmed the host-specific genogroups found by MLST, including the hospital specific genetic lineage. Comparison of MLVA with Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE), considered the “gold standard” typing method for infection control programs in hospitals, revealed that both methods were highly concordant in assigning genotypes and comparable in costs. PFGE revealed a higher discriminatory power, but MLVA was faster. Analysis of the up- and downstream regions of the esp gene among several isolates demonstrated that, like in E. faecalis, esp of E. faecium is contained on a putative pathogenicity island (PAI) with remarkable sequence heterogeneity including insertions, deletions and mutations. The E. faecium PAI has, so far, only been detected in outbreak related and clinical isolates, suggesting a role in nosocomial epidemicity. The population structure of E. faecium was elucidated with MLST and the existence of a distinct clonal complex, designated clonal complex-17 (CC17), associated with the majority of hospital outbreaks and clinical infections in five continents, was documented. This complex is correlated with ampicillin and quinolone resistance and the presence of the PAI. A retrospective study in the UMCU revealed ecological replacement of E. faecalis by CC17 E. faecium, illustrated by a decrease in total numbers of invasive enterococcal infections but an increase in proportions of invasive AREfm. Furthermore, the ratio E. faecium/E. faecalis among bloodstream isolates changed in favor of E. faecium. A similar increase of invasive AREfm was observed in hospitals dispersed over the Netherlands, although this increase was more pronounced in university hospitals than in non-university hospitals. MLVA typing of bloodstream isolates revealed clonal spread of 4 MLVA types, which seems associated with acquisition of the esp gene in two genotypes.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Hippocampus and memory abnormalities in schizophrenia: contributions of genes and environment'],\n",
       "  'Description': [\"Schizophrenia is an etiologically complex and severely debilitating psychiatric syndrome. The search for etiological factors and their mode of action in complex diseases requires an approach that allows for the assessment of disease liability irrespective of diagnosis. This thesis comprises a series of studies, employing epidemiologically valid samples, to examine genetic and environmental influences on hippocampal morphology, assessed using magnetic resonance imaging, and verbal declarative memory, assessed with the California Verbal Learning Test. The first study explored the contributions of genetic predisposition and history of fetal hypoxia to hippocampal volume in patients with psychosis using a family design. Patients had smaller hippocampal volumes than their full-siblings, who had smaller hippocampal volumes than healthy individuals. Only among patients, smaller hippocampal volumes were observed in those who experienced fetal hypoxia compared with those who did not. These findings suggest that in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, hippocampal volume is influenced in part by schizophrenia susceptibility genes and in part by an interaction of these genes with fetal hypoxia. The second study employed a twin design to establish whether the familial effect on reduced hippocampal volume in study one represents a genetic vulnerability marker for schizophrenia. Patients from dizygotic but not monozygotic pairs had smaller left hippocampi compared with their non-ill co-twins. Further, unaffected monozygotic, but not dizygotic, co-twins exhibited smaller left hippocampi compared with control twins. These findings suggest genetic influences on hippocampal volume reduction in schizophrenia. The third study, which employed an extended twin sample, found smaller hippocampi in patients compared with their non-ill monozygotic and dizygotic co-twins and healthy twins. Moreover, hippocampi of patients' non-ill co-twins were smaller than those of healthy twins. Heritability estimates for hippocampal volumes were seventy-one percent in healthy twins and forty-two percent in twins discordant for schizophrenia. These findings indicate that hippocampal volumes in healthy individuals are largely influenced by genetic factors, and subject to substantially greater modulation by environmental factors in schizophrenia. Given the putative involvement of the hippocampus in explicit memory, study four examined the sources of verbal recall and recognition deficits in schizophrenia. Compared with controls, patients and their co-twins showed relatively greater performance deficits on free recall compared with recognition. Both on free recall and recognition patients remembered fewer words than their monozygotic co-twins. The intra-pair differences between patients and their non-ill co-twins in hippocampal volume and memory performance were highly positively correlated. These findings suggest that genetic influences are associated with reduced verbal recall in schizophrenia, but that non-genetic influences further compromise these abnormalities in patients who manifest the full-blown schizophrenia phenotype, with this additional degree of disease-related declarative memory deficit mediated in part by hippocampal pathology. In conclusion, this thesis provides robust evidence for genetic and environmental influences on hippocampal morphological and verbal declarative memory abnormalities in schizophrenia, but much work lies ahead in order to determine the specific timing of occurrence of these deficits, the underlying micro-anatomical and molecular genetic bases, and their role in the expression of the symptoms that characterize the schizophrenia syndrome.\"],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Computer-aided detection and quantification of arterial calcifications with CT'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Atherosclerosis is the leading cause of death and disability in the Western world. Arterial calcifications are a marker of the disease and can be detected with computed tomography (CT) scans. In this thesis automatic methods for CT calcium scoring are presented. In CT scans calcifications appear as bright structures, and therefore they were extracted by thresholding and component labeling. However, other high-density objects, such as noise, bony structures, and metal implants were selected by this process as well. To identify true calcifications among all candidate objects, each object was described by features. Those features were derived from the candidate object\\'s location, its appearance, its shape and its size. Subsequently, a pattern recognition approach was used to identify true calcifications among all extracted candidate objects. A first study considered aortic calcifications in CTA scans of the abdomen. All high-density objects in the scan were considered and separated by a pattern recognition system. In terms of the number of calcifications the method resulted in a sensitivity of 83.9% at the expense of on average 1.0 false positive objects per scan. The scan was assigned to one of four categories (\"no\", \"small\", \"moderate\" or \"large\" amounts of calcification). The correct category label was assigned to 75.0% of scans. A similar approach was used for automatic coronary calcium scoring in non-contrast enhanced, ECG-gated multi-slice CT data. Here, the analysis was performed on the cardiac volume only. In addition to the previously mentioned characteristics, features were also derived from a segmentation of the heart and the aorta, which were extracted automatically using a rule-based scheme. An Agatston score was computed for each scan and subjects were assigned a risk category (0-10, 11-100, 101-400, >400). The correct category was assigned to 93.4% of subjects. Accurate segmentation of the heart and the aorta boundary were found to be essential for the performance of the coronary calcium scoring system. Robust segmentation of these structures is challenging, and therefore a general multi-atlas-based segmentation method was developed. The method was tested on the segmentation of the heart and the aorta in low-dose, non-gated, non-contrast enhanced CT scans of the thorax. The proposed method yielded results very close to those of an independent human observer. Moreover, atlas selection led to faster segmentation at comparable performance. Finally, using the results of the multi-atlas-based segmentation, a system for automatic detection of calcifications in the aorta was developed. In this study the same low-dose, non-gated, non-contrast enhanced CT scans of the thorax were used. Such scans are acquired in lung cancer screening trials and it would be worthwhile to perform calcium scoring in these scans, especially if this could be done automatically. A pattern recognition system was applied to the segmented aortic volume. A correct risk category was assigned to 88.3% of subjects. In conclusion, this thesis presents several systems for computerized detection of arterial calcifications. It is shown that automated calcium scoring is possible and can be used for risk category determination.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Sympathetic hyperactivity in patients with chronic kidney disease'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Sympathetic hyperactivity in patients with chronic kidney disease Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is often characterized by the presence of sympathetic hyperactivity. This contributes to the pathogenesis of renal hypertension. It is also associated with cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality independently of its effect on blood pressure (BP). These data suggest that reducing sympathetic hyperactivity might be beneficial. In the present thesis we studied sympathetic nerve activity in CKD patients, the pathophysiological aspects and its clinical outcome. In our research we registered muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) to assess sympathetic activity. MSNA is a reproducible direct online registration of post-synaptic nerve activity to resistance vessels and there is a direct correlation between MSNA and systemic vascular resistance. It has long been recognized that sympathetic activity increases with age and is feedback-regulated by baroreflex control and volume status. To unravel the mechanisms affecting the sympathetic nervous system we studied a large group of CKD patients and healthy controls in different volume states. On average MSNA was higher in normovolemic patients than in controls and was shifted parallel in both groups after changing the volume status. Furthermore after nephrectomy for kidney donation in healthy subjects the creatinine clearance was decreased by 25% by unchanged BP and MSNA. These results suggest that in hypertensive CKD patients MSNA is inappropriately high for the volume status and that the renal injury and not the reduction of nephrons in itself influences sympathetic activity. Previous studies have demonstrated that treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) and angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) decreased MSNA without normalization in CKD patients. We investigated the effect of treatment with the ARB eprosartan and the combined therapy with eprosartan and moxonidine (central inhibitor) in hypertensive CKD patients. Eprosartan reduced BP and MSNA comparably to other ACE and ARB, also without reaching normalization of MSNA and BP. When we added moxonidine to eprosartan, the therapy normalized BP and MSNA to levels comparable to healthy controls. The question was raised how often MSNA is increased in hypertensive patients with CKD. We studied a large data set of MSNA in CKD patients and healthy controls. More than 80% of the hypertensive patients had a MSNA higher than the mean in healthy controls. Chronic ACEi or ARB therapy reduced the sympathetic activity but did not normalize it. The fact that these treatments both decreased the activities of the renin angiotensin system and the MSNA, suggests a cause and effect relationship between these two systems or a common origin. Until now there are barely any data on the long term effect of sympathetic hyperactivity on CV outcome in CKD patients. We investigated the relationship between MSNA and clinical outcome in CKD patients by following CV morbidity and mortality in CKD patients who were on standard treatment with an ACEi or ARB for a median of 78 months. Despite of the positive effect of ACEi and ARB on BP and MSNA, the sympathetic hyperactivity predicted poor clinical outcome. In conclusion, this thesis presents; 1. the first long term research of the effects in sympathetic nerve activity in CKD patients 2. a breakthrough in controlling sympathetic activity pharmacologically 3. relevant information on the pathophysiology of sympathetic hyperactivity and hypertension in CKD patients.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Formulation of stable protein powders by supercritical fluid drying'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Protein pharmaceuticals are potent drugs for the treatment of several chronic and life-threatening diseases. However, the complex and sensitive nature of protein molecules requires special attention in the development of stable dosage forms. Developing stable aqueous protein formulations is often a problem. Dried formulations have been successfully used to overcome instability of the protein drug during shipping and long-term storage. Among the drying processes available, lyophilization, or freeze-drying, is the most commonly used technique for protein pharmaceuticals. However, lyophilization is an expensive, time- and energy-consuming process. Furthermore, some proteins are susceptible to damage during the freezing step and freeze-drying is not a method of choice if microparticulate powders with well-defined particle characteristics are needed, e.g., for pulmonary delivery. Supercritical fluid (SCF) drying has been proposed as an alternative to lyophilization. SCF drying is a fast process capable of producing microparticulate powders. In SCF drying the freezing step is bypassed, but factors like mixing, mass transport rates, droplet formation and composition of the SCF fluid can play a crucial role in drying kinetics and properties of dried products, as well as in the choice of the excipients. The aim of this thesis was to investigate the capability of SCF drying for protein stabilization. The primary goal was to gain new fundamental insights into the effect of processing and formulation parameters on the stability of proteins during and after drying from aqueous solution, as well as after storage and reconstitution. In particular, relationships between processing and formulation parameters, characteristics of the dried product and protein stability were studied to identify the critical parameters for successful protein stabilization by SCF drying. To this end, we selected readily available model proteins (lysozyme, myoglobin, and IgG) with various physicochemical characteristics. The results presented in this thesis show that SCF drying is capable of producing stable proteins embedded in an amorphous carbohydrate matrix. Some general recommendations established for protein stabilization in freeze-drying were shown to be valid for SCF drying as well. Firstly, the addition of a sugar (e.g., sucrose, trehalose) to the protein formulation prevents protein aggregation in the solid state as well as after reconstitution. Secondly, an amorphous matrix with a high glass transition temperature is preferred to avoid crystallization, which is detrimental for most proteins. Stabilizers commonly used in lyophilization yielded amorphous matrices. However, in SCF drying sucrose was more difficult to process as amorphous powder. Designing a SCF drying process to obtain a stable protein formulation turned out to be a delicate interplay between excipient selection and process optimization. SCF composition was important for successful drying. Although reported to be necessary for drying of aqueous solutions, the use of ethanol in SCF drying turned out to be detrimental for formulation stability. Unexpectedly high levels of residual ethanol had a plasticizing effect, which resulted in sugar crystallization during storage. We showed that it was possible to dry without ethanol or any other co-solvent with selected formulation and process parameters and to obtain stable dry protein formulations.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['On a global scale the impact and costs of plant diseases on agriculture is enormous, highlighting the importance of the research on this topic. Plant disease is the result of a compatible interaction between plants and adapted pathogens. The knowledge on the molecular mechanisms underlying compatibility or disease susceptibility is limited. The aim of this study was to identify Arabidopsis genes required for disease susceptibility to the oomycete Hyaloperonospora parasitica. We have undertaken a forward genetics approach to study susceptibility to downy mildew. Seeds of the susceptible Arabidopsis Ler eds1-2 line were mutagenised and twenty independent downy mildew resistant (dmr) Arabidopsis mutants were isolated of which eight were further characterized (described in chapter 2). Three dmr mutants, dmr1, dmr2 and dmr6, showed no induced expression of the defence-associated gene PR-1, and absence of programmed cell death and reactive oxidative intermediates, suggesting they are susceptibility mutants. In contrast, PR-1 expression was elevated in the dmr3, dmr4, and dmr5 mutants indicating that these mutants have an enhanced defence-response. The dmr1, dmr2, dmr5, and dmr6 mutants were still susceptible to other pathogens, such as the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato and the fungus Golovinomyces orontii. For two candidate susceptibility mutants, dmr1 and dmr6, the corresponding genes have been cloned (chapters 3 and 4). The DMR1 gene, At2g17265, was map-based cloned and found to encode for homoserine kinase (described in chapter 3). Homoserine kinase phosphorylates homoserine to phospho-homoserine. Amino acid analysis of the dmr1 mutants revealed high levels of homoserine that are absent in the parental line, Ler eds1-2. Infiltration of homoserine into Ler eds1-2 seedlings resulted in H. parasitica resistance. High levels of homoserine cause H. parasitica resistance in the dmr1 mutants via an as yet unknown mechanism. The DMR6 gene was found to encode for an oxido reductase (described in chapter 4). Oxido reductases catalyze the transfer of electrons from one molecule, the oxidant, to another, the reductant. For the DMR6 encoded oxido reductase no biological function has been demonstrated nor do we know the substrate and product of the predicted enzyme. DMR6 is locally up regulated during H. parasitica infection, in compatible and incompatible interactions. Other forms of biotic stress and abiotic stress result in an up regulation of DMR6. However, lack of DMR6, in the dmr6 mutants, results in resistance that is accompanied by the enhanced expression of a set of defence-associated transcripts, including DMR6. These results suggest a dual role of DMR6 during pathogen infection. The cloning of the DMR1 and DMR6 genes, which are required for H. parasitica susceptibility, has revealed novel ways to obtain disease resistance in plants, that have the potential to be applied in breeding for disease resistance. Future studies will reveal the molecular mechanisms that lead to loss of susceptibility to H. parasitica in the Arabidopsis dmr1 and dmr6 mutants.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The Hedgehog signaling pathway is controlling proliferation, patterning and differentiation during development of vertebrates and invertebrates. Aberrant Hedgehog activity has been shown to be one of the underlying causes of a number of congenital disorders and multiple types of cancer. We investigated the consequences of an increased activity of Hedgehog signaling, by forward and reverse genetic approaches, using zebrafish as a model organism. We identified and characterized four mutants encoding Hip, Sufu, Patched1 and Patched2, all functioning as negative regulators of the Hedgehog pathway. Loss of function of these genes results in a slight activation of the Hedgehog pathway, leading to subtle morphological phenotypes. Zebrafish mutants for Patched1 and Patched2 were generated in an attempt to investigate the consequences of a constitutive activation of the pathway. These mutants show severe developmental defects, including an absence of the eyes, nose and pectoral fins and reduced pigmentation. Additionally, patched1/patched2 double mutants show a loss of blood circulation. Detailed analysis showed that a constitutive activation of the Hedgehog pathway induces ectopic formation of arteries at the expanse of venous formation. \\n\\r\\nThe identified mutants assign novel and unexpected roles to the Hedgehog signaling pathway.

       "  'Description': [\"'Living-Dead:\\r\\n\\r\\nAfrican-Surinamese perceptions, practices and rituals surrounding death and mourning' \\r\\ndescribes and interprets the death culture of the descendants of African slaves, Creoles and Maroons, in Suriname. The book offers an integrated approach in which a wide range of attitudes comes to the fore, and uncommon (supernatural, bad or tragic) and common (natural, good) death are studied together. In this way, the study presents a comparative and reflexive perspective that reconciles ethnographic detail with middle range theories. The book is guided by two leitmotifs. The first concerning the coexistence of tradition and modernity or the phenomenon of multitemporal heterogeneity, arguing that African-Surinamese actors always live, on the one hand, in terms of conflicting demands, desires and expectations associated with voices of authority and, on the other, with the idiosyncratic aspirations of the individual. Processes like creolization, syncretization/anti-syncretization and de-/retraditionalization play a prominent role in this dialectic and, consequently, in the construction of African-Surinamese death culture as well as people's changing attitudes towards dying, death and mourning. Despite this dynamic nature, African-Surinamese culture is characterized by an inevitable constant that forms the second leitmotif of this study: the living-dead. Throughout this study it appears that within the African-Surinamese worldview and spiritual-religious orientation, (biological) death does not necessarily mean the end of life. Death rather implies a continuation of life in another form, in which contacts between the living and the deceased (or their spirits) are still possible. The dead are not dead: they are the living-dead who might interfere in people's lives - as spiritual entities or simply as a lasting remembrance. Living-dead have therefore to be handled with utmost care and respect, while the rituals regarding death, burial and mourning are considered as the most important rites de passage of African-Surinamese culture. Because of the enormous significance of the living-dead and the subsequent transitional rituals, an important part of this book consists of the description, analysis and interpretation of the ritual process that starts at the deathbed or even before the dying hour. In the conceptualization of death as a process and transition, I draw heavily on Van Gennep's model of rites of passage, Hertz's study of liminal rituals as well as his insights into the relationship between corpse, soul and mourners, and several contemporary followers of these founding fathers. This classical anthropological approach incorporates also contemporary perspectives and developments, like the medicalization, privatization and commercialization of death. As in other societies, Suriname is characterized by a 'denial of death' resulting in a detraditionalization of death culture. Because of Creole nationalism, black consciousness, back-to-the-roots movements and a nostalgic search for authenticity, especially by Dutch-Surinamese migrants, retraditionalization of death rituals takes place at the same time. 'Living-Dead' gives a thick description of these paradoxical trends and interprets African-Surinamese death culture, from a historical perspective, as a hybrid celebration in which (reinvented) traditions of different religious-spiritual orientations, modern glocalized cultural codes, and diverse forms of conspicuous consumption have blended.\"],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Degenerative lumbosacral stenosis (DLS) is now recognized as a significant cause of caudal lumbar pain and pelvic limb lameness in dogs. The condition includes lumbosacral intervertebral disc degeneration and protrusion, spondylosis deformans, sclerosis of the vertebral end plates, osteoarthrosis of articular facets, ventral sacral subluxation, and hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum and joint capsules. The clinical signs are caudal lumbar pain, pelvic limb lameness, reluctance to jump, rise and climb stairs, and neurological signs. Diagnosis of DLS is based on the history, clinical signs, clinical examination, and imaging findings. The surgical treatment of dogs with DLS aims to relieve the compression on the cauda equina nerve roots. The first aim of this thesis was to determine the diagnostic value of advanced imaging techniques. The findings between computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and surgery were compared There was substantial to almost perfect agreement between the findings on CT and MRI for the degree and location of disc protrusion, the position of the dural sac, the presence of epidural fat, and swelling of nerve roots. There was slight to fair agreement between imaging and surgical findings for the degree and location of disc protrusion, and swelling of nerve roots. CT and MRI provided excellent discrimination of compressive tissues in the spinal canal. The second aim was to investigate the somatosensory function in dogs affected by DLS. Compressive lesions on the cauda equina at L7-S1 in dogs with DLS prolonged the mean latency of tibial nerve somatosensory evoked potentials in dogs with DLS compared with those in clinically normal dogs. The third aim was to objectively evaluate, using force plate analysis (FPA), the result of decompressive surgery in dogs with DLS. In 12 dogs, surgical treatment restored the propulsive forces of the pelvic limbs in a 6-month period after surgery. The long-term outcome of decompressive surgery in 35 dogs with DLS was assessed by FPA and questionnaires to owners. The propulsive forces of the pelvic limbs, and the ratio between the propulsive forces of the pelvic limbs and the thoracic limbs decreased significantly at 3 days after surgery, and increased during 6 months follow-up, but remained smaller than control values with long-term (? 1.5 years) follow up. In contrast, the results from the questionnaires showed significant improvement 6 months to 1.5 years after surgery compared to findings before surgery, and the majority of owners were satisfied. Biomechanical flexion-extension load forces were assessed in cadaveric lumbosacral specimens of healthy middle-sized dogs, before and after dorsal laminectomy with partial discectomy, and after pedicle screw-rod fixation. The flexion and extension load forces after dorsal laminectomy with partial discectomy, were not significantly different from those in the native lumbosacral spine specimen. After pedicle screw-rod fixation, the motions in the instrumented spine segment decreased significantly. Pedicle screw-rod fixation may be used to effectively stabilize the instable L7-S1 junction in dogs with DLS.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Foot and mouth disease (FMD) is a contagious disease, affecting important livestock species like cattle, sheep and pigs. Therefore, FMD is listed as a notifiable disease to the Office International des Epizooties. The outbreaks of FMD in Europe in 2001 triggered the discussion about the use of vaccination as an additional control measure. The aim of vaccination during an epidemic of FMD is to stop virus transmission among animals or between herds. The main purpose of the work presented in this thesis was to quantify the efficacy of vaccination against FMDV in cattle, sheep and pigs, and to compare virus excretion and virus spread before clinical signs become apparent in vaccinated and non-vaccinated populations of the three host species. Transmission was quantified with reproduction ratio R, i.e. the expected number of secondary cases produced by a typical infected individual during its entire period of infectiousness in a completely susceptible population. With a reproduction ratio significantly below 1, no major outbreaks are likely to occur. Also, the size of an outbreak on a herd to be expected at the moment of first detection of clinical signs was estimated. Differences were observed between vaccine efficacy in the various species. In vaccinated calves R was significantly below 1. In vaccinated dairy cows no transmission was observed. In sheep, R was estimated below 1, although not significantly. Limited vaccine effectiveness in pigs was found; R was estimated above 1. When the vaccination capacity is limited, these findings indicate that a differentiated vaccination programme for various species might be applied. At the moment of clinical detection, most infected individuals can be expected in a pig herd. Combined with the limited vaccine efficacy priority might best be given to culling of pig herds.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Antibiotic resistance in Salmonella'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Immediately after their introduction in the beginning of the fourties of the previous century, the agents used to combat infectious diseases caused by bacteria were regarded with suspicion, but not long thereafter antibiotics had the status of miracle drugs. For decades mankind has lived under the impression that infectious diseases were no longer a threat to human health. This optimism was so high at a certain moment that antibiotics were also used against viral infections, whereas viruses are not even sensitive to antibiotics. This wrong use, or if one likes, misuse of antibiotics took also place in animal husbandry, where many tons of antibiotics were added to the feed of healthy animals, just because they grew so nicely from these additives. However, also in the use of antibiotics an ancient law in physics, “action equals reaction” turned out to be applicable. Bacteria reacted to the fact that they were attacked by changing their hereditary properties (through mutation) or by taking up parts of the hereditary properties of organisms (bacteria and fungi) able to produce certain antibiotics themselves. As a result of this reaction, already a short while after the introduction of antibiotics, the first bacteria could be isolated that had become insensitive (immune) for particular antibiotics. The bacteria in fact, had even more surprises in store. They turned out to be fanatic collectors of the pieces of hereditary properties that made them immune for antibiotics and like a stamp collector puts his stamps in an album, they also put their collection in an album (an integron). In this way, the best collectors have now become insensitive to more than ten different types of antibiotics. At the moment there are even bacteria that are not sensitive anymore to whatever type of antibiotic and for these bacteria treatment with antimicrobial agents is no longer available. Where, “work together, live together” is the current motto of the Dutch government, “work together to survive together” might be the motto of bacteria. They put this into practice by passing on their album with its integron collection from one bacterial species to the other. In this way a bacterium that used to be sensitive and could very well be treated with antibiotics can in one stroke become resistant to sometimes thirteen different antimicrobial agents, resulting in the fact that an infection with such a bacterium becomes untreatable. In this thesis research with respect to the sensitivity of the bacterium Salmonella, which can cause intestinal infections in human and animals, for antimicrobial agents is described. Since the (wrong) use of antibiotics can influence the development of resistance to antibiotics, in these studies a comparison has been made between Salmonella bacteria isolated from human, pigs, cattle and poultry in Vietnam and The Netherlands. Whereas in The Netherlands antibiotics are only available on prescription by a physician or veterinarian, antibiotics can be purchased over the counter in Vietnam. This leads to a significantly different attitude in both countries with respect to handling antibiotics. Examples are i.e. not taking a course of antibiotics of the correct dose, not taking a course of antibiotics of sufficient duration, not only taking a course of antibiotics in the case of bacterial infections and the continuing use of antibiotics as growth promoters in Vietnam. Resistance to antibiotics in Salmonella bacteria isolated in Vietnam turned out to occur frequently. In the Netherlands where the development of resistance has been monitored and registered for years the problem was hardly less. In Salmonella isolates from some animal species even resistance to antibiotics for which the use of that antibiotic is not allowed in that animal, was observed. In the current studies Salmonella bacteria have been isolated, both in Vietnam and in the Netherlands that have a collection in their integron album which is unique and has not been described before. At the end of the thesis the measures that could be taken to counteract the development of antibiotic resistance are discussed. The necessity of continuously making an inventory of the situation at local, regional, national and global level is accentuated, as is the shared responsibility that the government and civilians have with respect to the improper use of antibiotics.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The connection between the mesoscale eddy activity around Madagascar and the large-scale interannual variability in the Indian Ocean is investigated. We use the combined TOPEX/Poseidon-ERS sea surface height (SSH) data for the period 1993-2003. The SSH-fields in the Mozambique Channel and east of Madagascar exhibit a significant interannual oscillation. This is related to the arrival of large-scale anomalies that propagate westward in the band 10-15S in response to the Indian Ocean dipole (IOD) events. Positive (negative) SSH anomalies associated to a positive (negative) IOD phase induce a shift in the intensity and position of the tropical and subtropical gyres in the Indian Ocean. A weakening (strengthening) results in the intensity of the South Equatorial Current and its branches along east Madagascar. In addition, the flow through the narrows of the Mozambique Channel around 17S increases (decreases) during periods of a stronger and northward (southward) extension of the subtropical (tropical) gyre. Interaction between the currents in the narrows and southward propagating eddies from the northern Channel leads to interannual variability in the eddy kinetic energy of the central Channel in phase with the one in the SSH-field. The origin of the eddy variability along the 25S band in the Indian Ocean is also investigated. We have found that the surface circulation east of Madagascar shows an anticyclonic subgyre bounded to the south by eastward flow from southwest Madagascar and to the north by the westward flowing South Equatorial Current (SEC) between 15-20S. The shallow, eastward flow, named the South Indian Ocean Countercurrent (SICC), extends above the deep reaching, westward flowing SEC up to 95E, with its core over the latitude of the high variability band. Applying a 2-layer model reveals that regions of large vertical shear along the SICC-SEC system are baroclinically unstable. Estimates of the frequencies (3.5-6 times/year) and wavelengths (290-470 km) of the unstable modes are close to observations of the mesoscale eddy variability derived from altimetry data. It is likely then that Rossby wave variability locally generated in the subtropical South Indian Ocean by baroclinic instability is the origin of the eddy variability around 25S as seen for example in satellite altimetry.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The present thesis addresses the influence of aquatic interventions on motor performance of children with neuro-motor deficiencies in a functional context. The theoretical framework is based on a functional approach in compliance to the International Classification of Function and Disability (ICF). Chapter 2 addresses the relationship between motor performance in the aquatic environment setting as measured by the Aquatic Independence Measure (AIM) to motor performance on land as measured by the Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM) and the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (PEDI) in a sample of 49 children with neuro-motor impairments. Significant relations were found between the total AIM and GMFM scores and PEDI self-care domains. Chapter 3 reviews aquatic intervention research in children with neuro-motor deficiencies aiming to evaluate research reported in relation to the ICF terminology (changes in body function, activity level and participation). Eleven of the 173 articles retrieved met the inclusion criteria. According to this review, there is a substantial lack of evidence - based research evaluating the specific effects of aquatic interventions in this population. Chapter 4 compares the effects of a four-month aquatic to land based intervention on energy expenditure and gross motor function in 17 children with spastic diplegia cerebral palsy (CP). Nine children (5.3 yr + 1.02) received aquatic and eight children (4.7 yr + .95) exercise intervention. Energy expenditure was measured by expired gas by means of Cosmed K4b2 metabolic system and the energy expenditure index based on heart rate measures. Self- paced and fast walking velocity were measured by the 10 meter walk. Gross motor performance was measured by the GMFM and PEDI. No differences were found between groups in energy expenditure measures. However, group effect sizes and mean trends suggested a more favorable decrease in energy expenditure in the aquatic intervention group in comparison to the exercise intervention group. Effect sizes of the ten meter walk were larger in the exercise group in comparison to the aquatic intervention group. Significant differences were found in the PEDI self care domain in favor of the aquatic intervention group. Based on this study it is recommended to combine both means of interventions to increase functional levels of motor performance in this population. Chapter 5 addresses the effects of a four-months aquatic compared to an exercise land based intervention on perceived competence and social acceptance in 22 children with spastic diplegia CP. Twelve children (5.4 yr + .95) received aquatic and ten children (5.4 yr + .95) exercise intervention. Perceived competence was measured by means of the physical and social sub-scales of the Pictorial scale for Perceived Competence and Social Acceptance (PSPCSA-CP). Social function was measured by means of the PEDI social function domain. Differences in social acceptance were found in favor of the aquatic intervention group and no differences were found in perceived physical competence. Significant differences between pre to post scores in the PEDI social function domain of the care givers were found in the aquatic intervention group. Aquatic intervention appears to have a positive effect on perceived social acceptance and social function as reported by caregivers.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Incorporation of a lipid conjugate of a water-soluble polymer into liposomes can reduce the adhesion of plasma proteins that would otherwise cause rapid recognition and removal of the liposomes by phagocytes. Such polymer-coated liposomes show prolonged circulation property and passive targeting to pathological tissues such as tumors or inflamed sites. This thesis describes the evaluation of two poly(amino acid) (PAA)-lipid conjugates for the coating of long-circulating liposomes as an alternative to poly(ethylene glycol)-phosphatidylethanolamine (PEG-PE), which is the polymer-conjugate of choice for the preparation of long-circulating liposomes. Two conjugates based on poly(hydroxyethyl L-glutamine) (PHEG) and poly(hydroxyethyl L-asparagine) (PHEA) were investigated. A 1H-NMR method was developed to quantify grafted poly(amino acid)-conjugates on the liposome surface. Pharmacokinetic properties of long-circulating liposomes are dependent on the grafting density of the coating polymer on the liposome surface, and therefore quantification methods are highly needed. The pharmacokinetic behavior of PAA-coated liposomes was studied in rats, when liposome characteristics were varied. The influence of PAA grafting density, bilayer fluidity, inclusion of charged lipids and particle size was evaluated. It was demonstrated that the prolonged circulation kinetics of PAA-liposomes can be maintained upon variation of the liposomes characteristics and the lipid dose given. For PEG-liposomes, rapid clearance from the circulation has been reported when administered at low lipid dose and upon repeated administration. PAA-liposomes, however, showed unaltered pharmacokinetic behavior in rats at low lipid doses, which are applied for e.g. diagnostic imaging of tumors and sites of inflammation. Furthermore, PHEA-liposomes show superior circulation kinetics when compared to PEG-liposomes upon repeated administration. Initial results on the activation of the complement system by PAA-liposomes in vitro and in a porcine model of complement-mediated cardiopulmonary distress show that, like other types of liposomes, also PHEA- and PHEG-coated liposomes are activators of the complement system. PHEG was proven to be degradable by the model proteases papain, pronase E and the lysosomal cathepsin B when it is in solution and also when it is grafted to a liposome surface. Such enzymatic degradability reduces the risk of intracellular polymer accumulation and possible side effects upon repeated exposure. Furthermore, removal of the coating from the liposome surface (shedding) by enzymatic degradation can be used to facilitate target cell interaction of the nanoparticle and/or drug release. It was investigated whether liposomes composed of the fusogenic, non-bilayer-forming lipid DOPE and the sheddable PHEG-lipid conjugate can be used as a passively targeted liposome system, which efficiently releases the entrapped contents upon arrival at the target site. Enzymatic degradation of PHEG led to destabilization of the liposomes and concomitant release of an encapsulated fluorescent dye. One can envisage triggered drug release at the target site, either extracellularly by the action of proteases in the extracellular space of tumors and sites of inflammation or intracellularly after PHEG-degradation in the endo/lysosomal compartment and possibly endosomal escape. In conclusion, due to their favorable properties as described in this thesis, poly(amino acid)-conjugates represent next-generation coatings for the preparation of long-circulating liposomes for the systemic delivery of therapeutic agents.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['In this thesis we used a variety of approaches for biomarker discovery; in Part I we assessed whether we could identify a non-invasive surrogate markers of angiogenesis, as new vessel formation plays critical roles in the growth and metastatic spread of tumors. Moreover, many agents targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway are currently being evaluated in clinical trials, however robust surrogate endpoints of biological activity or biomarkers for patient selection are still lacking for this assessment. Circulating endothelial cells shed from the angiogenic tumor microenvironment (Chapter 3), and endothelial progenitor cells mobilized by the tumor from the bone-marrow (Chapter 4) are evaluated as surrogate markers of angiogenesis and are studied further as marker for the assessment of optimal biological dose and surrogate endpoint during treatment with phosphokinase C-inhibitor Enzastaurin, an anti-angiogenic targeting agent in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin based chemotherapy (Chapter 5). \\n\\r\\nIn Part II we addressed the question whether extracellular nucleic acids present in the plasma of patients with cancer, could be quantified using real-time amplification for use as prognostic biomarker (reviewed in Chapter 7). These circulating nucleic acids are largely derived by necrosis or apoptosis of the tumor. Most studies have evaluated whether these circulating nucleic acids were could be used as diagnostic marker, however, as this biomarker likely reflects tumor activity we investigated whether circulating nucleic acid may serve as a prognostic biomarker. Every tumor cell that releases nucleic acids (due to necrosis or apoptosis) will have multiple gene copies of mitochondrial genes compared to genomic genes, as cells contain hundreds of mitochondria compared to one nucleus. Therefore we addressed whether mitochondrial gene amplification had elevated sensitivity and specificity as biomarker compared to genomic nucleic acids. We collected plasma from patients with advanced prostate caner and patients with benign prostate hyperplasia and assessed the strength of mitochondrial nucleic acids as prognostic biomarker compared to established prognostic variables such as prostate specific antigen (PSA) and hemoglobin count (Chapter 8), and as pan-tumor marker in patients with prostate, head and neck, kidney and colorectal cancer (Chapter 9). Due to discrepancies in the literature on applicability of circulating nucleic acids as prognostic or predictive factor, we demonstrate that methodology, sample preparation and storage strongly affect results (Chapter 10). \\n\\r\\nIn Part III we use a different approach of \"discovery-based research\" analyzing proteomic expression patterns in serum of renal cancer patients (introduction in Chapter 11). Surface Enhanced Desorption Ionisation-Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS) has resulted in a serum proteome wide search of expression signatures for cancer diagnostics in a variety of cancers such as ovarian, breast, prostate, colorectal cancer. However, promising at first proteomics is criticized because of the lack of reproducibility between institutes and research groups. Therefore we first investigated the reproducibility of SELDI-TOF MS in two Dutch institutes using identical assay procedures of two previous published studies on patients with renal cell carcinoma (Chapter 12). Next, we investigated whether we could identify a serum expression signature that could predict patient outcome prior to anti-tumor treatment, and which was an independent predictor when compared to the gold standard of survival prediction, the extended Memorial Sloan-Kettering Prognostic Factors Model for survival (Chapter 13). \\n\\r\\nThis thesis is framed by a general discussion on the three chapters, by means of a debate on a number of controversies in the literature concerning this thesis (Chapter 14).'],\n",

       "  'Description': [\"The antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a non-inflammatory autoimmune disease clinically characterized by the occurrence of either venous or arterial thrombosis or the presence of specific pregnancy complications. Serological criteria are the persistent presence of antibodies directed against cardiolipin or β2-glycoprotein I (β2-GPI) or a prolonged clotting time due to the presence of lupus anticoagulant in plasma. The precise mechanism behind the pathology of APS is largely unknown. Previous work demonstrated that blood platelets incubated with β2-GPI, dimerized by auto-antibodies or monoclonal antibodies become pro-thrombotic. A recombinant dimeric β2-GPI in which the dimerization domain of clotting factor XI (apple4) was used for dimerization, mimics the pro-thrombotic properties of β2-GPI-anti-β2-GPI complexes. In perfusion studies we found that upon dimerization, β2-GPI binds to the platelet receptors Apolipoprotein receptor E2' and Glycoprotein Ibα (ApoER2' and GPIbα). Platelets express 3 different splice variants of ApoER2 which can all participate in signaling events. The splice variant of ApoER2 on platelets expressed the most abundant and participating the strongest in ApoER2 signaling lacks LDL-binding domains 3, 4, 5 and 6 (ApoER2-750 or ApoER2'). Domain deletion studies showed that the binding site for dimeric β2-GPI resides in the LDL-binding domain I of ApoER2'. LDL-binding domain I was expressed in all three ApoER2 splice variants present on platelets. Solid phase binding assays showed the binding site for dimeric β2-GPI on GPIbα in close proximity of the thrombin biding site. The interaction between dimeric β2-GPI and GPIbα was depending on the presence of Zn2+. Dimeric β2-GPI bound to both ApoER2' and GPIbα via its domain V and the binding site for negatively charged phospholipids and ApoER2' did not overlap. The binding site on dimeric β2-GPI for GPIbα and ApoER2 did not overlap either. We furthermore showed that ApoER2' and GPIbα are present in a receptor complex on platelets independent of the presence of dimeric β2-GPI or cytoskeletal association. To test physiological relevance of the interactions of dimeric β2-GPI with ApoER2' and GPIbα, perfusion studies were performed. The interaction of dimeric β2-GPI with both ApoER2' and GPIbα and subsequent downstream receptor specific signaling events were required for platelet activation and adhesion to dimeric β2-GPI and fibronectin under conditions of flow. The transient dissociation of ApoER2 from its adaptor protein Dab-1 however, was not inhibited when dimeric β2-GPI binding to GPIbα binding was blocked. Also, GPIbα translocation towards the cytoskeleton via its adaptor protein 14-3-3-ζ could not be inhibited by blocking dimeric β2-GPI binding to ApoER2'. These observations suggest the presence of a common pathway downstream of the initial signaling events. This common pathway is currently under investigation.  The work presented in this thesis opens new therapeutic windows in the treatment of APS. Molecular understanding of protein-protein interactions and subsequent downstream events will help understanding the mechanisms involved in the pathology of APS. In-vitro, blocking the binding of dimerized β2-GPI to either ApoER2' or GPIbα was sufficient to block the pro-thrombotic phenotype of blood platelets induced by binding of dimeric β2-GPI. Animal studies are currently being used to test efficacy of blocking the interaction of dimeric β2-GPI with either GPIbα or ApoER2'.\"],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The objective of this thesis was to gain a better understanding of the relationship between ischemic lesion characteristics and long-term functional outcome of stroke survivors. The relationship between volume and localization of the ischemic cerebral lesion and the long-term functional outcome of first-ever ischemic middle cerebral artery stroke survivors was studied. Volume and localization was obtained with conventional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. Outcome was assessed at the levels of body functions, activities and participation according to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). (1) In a systematic review, we found that previous studies showed a strong relationship between lesion volume and short-term outcome. However, earlier studies investigated only short follow-up periods up till 3-6 months, although functional improvement still occurs after 6 months. Furthermore, it was not clear if lesion volume related to all different levels of functional outcome (ICF) . (2) In the second week after stroke a strong relationship between lesion volume and neurological deficits was found as well as moderate correlations between lesion volume and body functions and limitations in activities. (3) Moderate relationships between lesion volume and functional outcome and quality of life after one year poststroke were demonstrated. A clinical model with clinical variables only predicted outcome of Activities of Daily Living of the stroke survivor after one year with an accuracy of 77%. Adding neuro-imaging variables to the clinical model increased the accuracy to 83%, but this difference was not statistically significant. (4) Involvement of structures with a greater density of corticofugal fibres (internal capsule) was associated with poor recovery of hand motor function after 1-year poststroke. The probability of recovery of some or all of the hand function ranged from 51% for those patients in whom the motor cortex was affected, to only 13% for those patients in whom both motor cortex and internal capsule were affected. (5) Our study showed that hemispheric lesion side, level and volume were weak to moderate predictors of verbal memory. Performance on visual recognition could not be predicted by lesion characteristics. (6) Stroke volume is a reflection of damaged brain tissue. A larger infarction leads to more deterioration of body functions, more activity limitations and a lesser capacity to participate, as well as an impaired Quality of Life. The strength of correlation between lesion characteristics and functional outcome weakens after a longer follow-up period post stroke. (7) Besides to its volume, the location of the lesion is important, especially for the outcome of motor function of the upper paretic limb. Long-term poststroke, the effect of localization was seen for hand motor recovery as well as for long-term episodic memory disorders.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Abstract During pregnancy the firm cartilage-like consistency of the cervix is transformed to soft tissue. This transformation is called \"cervical ripening\" and enables the cervix to dilate and facilitate parturition. In 1960, the Bishop Score was introduced to assess cervical ripeness before induction of labour, which is determined by digital examination. The Bishop Score consists of five different aspects of the cervix, namely dilatation, effacement, consistency, position and station of the presenting part of the fetus. Since then, also assessment of preterm cervical ripeness and cervical incompetence is determined by the Bishop Score. Only recently, in the nineteen eighties, the usefulness of transvaginal sonography (TVS) of the cervix for the detection of cervical incompetence became apparent. The advantages of TVS compared to digital examination of the cervix were recognized shortly after its introduction. Early cervical ripening, resulting in changes at the internal cervical os, can be observed by TVS, even in the absence of dilatation. Nowadays, it is considered to be reproducible and easy to learn, even for inexperienced investigators. TVS of the cervix is now widely used as a screening method for preterm delivery in symptomatic and asymptomatic women. In the latest two decades, the clinical use of TVS of the cervix has further been expanded. There was need for a way to predict the outcome of labour induction at term more accurately than by the Bishop Score. In several studies pre-induction assessment of cervical ripeness by TVS has been compared with digital examination, but so far results are conflicting. It is striking that with the rapid evolvement of TVS in general clinical practice, only a few small studies report on physiological changes of the cervix preceding term labour. Knowledge of the physiology of the cervix at term is necessary to interpret TVS results in case of threatened preterm labour or before induction of labour at term. The general objective of this thesis was to study the cervix by TVS at term to obtain more insight in physiological changes preceding parturition, and to relate these changes or otherwise to the onset and course of spontaneous labour and to the need for and outcome of induced labour. Unfortunately, we found large variation in CL changes preceding spontaneous onset of labour, which restricts clinical utilization. However, a few recommendations can be made. CL has wide normal ranges throughout pregnancy. Before term, a short cervix is exceptional, however the chance of delivering in case of a short cervix is comparable to the flip of a coin. In contrast, preterm delivery is highly unlikely in case of a long cervix. At term, it is exactly the opposite. A long cervix at term is exceptional, although it does not at all exclude spontaneous onset of labour within short time. A short cervix at 37 weeks is reassuring, however spontaneous onset of labour may not be due until weeks. A short cervix on TVS at prolonged pregnancy may be in favour of expectant management. On the other hand, a short cervix at pre-induction TVS increases the chance of a vaginal delivery. Adding a maternal postural change to the examination improves the assessment of the functional status of the cervix. With knowledge of its limitations, TVS of the cervix can be used at term gestation.'],\n",

       "  'Description': [\"Pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism (PDH) or Cushing's disease is a common endocrinopathy in the elderly dog caused by a pituitary adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) producing tumor (corticotroph adenoma) of unknown pathogenesis. Surgical removal of the pituitary tumor is applied as routine treatment of dogs with PDH at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Utrecht University. Since 1993, more than 230 dogs have been operated. The aims of the present thesis were: (1) to analyze the long-term results and predictors for transsphenoidal hypophysectomy for the treatment of PDH in dogs; and (2) to perform molecular biological studies on the pituitary adenomas. Long-term follow-up confirmed that transsphenoidal hypophysectomy is an effective treatment for PDH in dogs in the hands of a skilled neurosurgeon. Dogs with enlarged pituitary glands have shorter survival, shorter disease-free periods and increased risk of developing permanent central diabetes insipidus. Old age and high plasma concentrations of ACTH were associated with a higher risk of PHD-related mortality. Large pituitary size, thick sphenoid bone, high preoperative urinary corticoid-to-creatinine ratio (UCCR), and high plasma alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) concentration were risk factors for recurrence. Immediate post-operative (4h) measurement of the plasma concentrations of ACTH, cortisol and alpha-MSH or postoperative (6-10 wk) measurement of UCCR were predictive for the long-term outcome. UCCR in the upper reference range (5-10 x 10-6) is associated with a higher risk of recurrence than UCCR in the lower reference range (< 5 x 10-6). In the molecular biological studies, factors were investigated that promote normal differentiation of the corticotrophs during ontogenesis. It was hypothesized that a dysregulation of either the pituitary T-box transcription factor Tbx19 (Tpit), neurogenic differentiation (NeuroD1) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) or LIF receptor was involved in the pathogenesis of the corticotroph adenomas. Expression and mutation analyses were performed. Tbx19 proved to be a useful marker for cells that are expressing pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), the precursor of ACTH and alpha-MSH. No tumor-specific mutation was found in Tbx19. However, interestingly, a commonly occurring missense polymorphism was discovered in the most conserved part of the protein (the Tbox) in Bernese Mountain dogs. The function of the polymorfism is unknown. The expression of NeuroD1 was low in the neurointermediate lobe and differed among the corticotroph adenomas. There was strong co-expression of LIFR and POMC. The presence of LIFR in the intermediate lobe may serve as a non-neuronal regulatory mechanism for alpha-MSH secretion. This is highly interesting with respect to the recently recognized anti-inflammatory properties of alpha-MSH. It can be concluded that the research presented in this thesis has contributed valuable information for the prediction of surgical outcome after transsphenoidal hypophysectomy for the treatment of PDH in dogs, and provided insight in the role of pituitary ontogenic factors in pituitary physiology and oncogenesis later in life.\"],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Sick with burnout : clarified through electronic diaries'],\n",
       "  'Description': [\"The primary aim of this thesis is to enlarge our understanding of severe or clinical burnout through an extensive study on the actual functioning in daily life of burned-out individuals. Burnout is a fairly recent but common work-related health problem. About 20% of employees suffers from mild burnout symptoms and an additional 4% from severe symptoms. The main cause of burnout is chronic stress at work, which induces a process of psychological erosion. The result is a state of severe exhaustion, with a co-occurring cynical attitude towards work and the belief that one's professional accomplishments have failed. Burnout research has concentrated on milder expressions of the syndrome in relatively healthy employees who are still working. Yet, when burnout symptoms have emerged, they seem resistant to change and the risk of sick leave increases. It is, therefore, surprising that the most severe cases on extended sick leave have been neglected in burnout research. Consequently, the exact characteristics of clinical burnout are still badly understood. This thesis seeks to extend our understanding of the symptoms of clinically burned-out employees and to enhance diagnostic clarity. To obtain a detailed account of patients' symptoms we employed an electronic diary according to the Experience Sampling Method (ESM) instead of using the common retrospective questionnaires. ESM provides more reliable and detailed information in the natural context of burned-out individuals. The current thesis showed that clinical burnout is characterized by continuous severe fatigue that is not relieved by sleep and is, at least partially, maintained by sleep disturbances. Though depressive mood is common in clinical burnout, we found new evidence that depression does not seem to complicate the syndrome and that burnout and depression are distinct syndromes. The severity of exhaustion is reflected in the physiology of the body, namely somewhat lower cortisol levels at awakening. Nevertheless, full recovery from clinical burnout is possible in the long-run: Within 10 months after sick leave 37% of our clinically burned-out employees showed recovery of complaints and had fully resumed work. These findings are, likely, highly reliable, considering that we used ESM for symptom assessment, and that the method was well accepted and adhered to by the exhausted patients. The current thesis evidently demonstrates the advantages of ESM above questionnaires, i.e. a higher reliability of measurements and the possibility of within-person studies. As for clinical practice, our results point out that persistent disturbed sleep and neglect of regular periods of recovery constitute important early warning signs of burnout development in employees who are at work. In addition, the treatment of sleep problems in burned-out individuals on extended leave of absence seems of primary importance, since they constitute a risk factor for prolonged sick leave and exhaustion. Furthermore, patient education should incorporate that full recovery from clinical burnout lies within reach of many individuals. The current thesis was only a first step, and hopes to inspire research on clinical burnout with the purpose to enhance empirical knowledge and improve clinical practice.\"],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Improving pertussis vaccines by lipopolysaccharide engineering'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Pertussis or whooping cough is a highly contagious respiratory tract disease that is caused by the Gram-negative bacterium Bordetella pertussis. Introduction of whole-cell pertussis (wP) vaccines in the 1940s and 1950s, and later of acellular pertussis (aP) vaccines in the 1980s and 1990s, led to a rapid decline in pertussis incidence. However, as of the 1980s, the numbers of pertussis cases are rising again in many countries, including the Netherlands. Furthermore, whereas pertussis first was a typical disease of young children, it is nowadays predominantly found among adolescents, adults, and, of most concern, immunologically immature small infants. The exact reasons for this re-emergence and altered age distribution are currently not well understood and remain under intense debate. Thus, although pertussis vaccination has been proved successful, the illness remains an important health issue. It is therefore of great importance that novel pertussis vaccines are being developed. The work described in this thesis is mainly focused on the development of an improved wP vaccine. An important problem that should be dealt with is that wP vaccines exhibit considerable reactogenicity. This high reactogenicity is mainly due to the presence of a bio-active molecule, known as lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS is one of the major constituents of the Gram-negative bacterial outer membrane and is also known as endotoxin. The endotoxic activity of LPS is mainly determined by the composition of its lipid A moiety. It has been shown that changes in lipid A composition can modulate the endotoxic activity of the LPS. Here, we explored the possibilities of improving wP vaccines by altering their LPS composition. We did this either by expressing LPS-modifying enzymes, by changing LPS biosynthesis in the vaccine strain, or by adding non-toxic LPS derivatives to the vaccine. In addition, we investigated whether the supplementation of aP vaccines with LPS derivatives could be useful for improving these vaccines. We provide proof of principle that altering the LPS composition can indeed be a useful strategy for improving both wP and aP vaccines. We show that modulation of LPS composition cannot only decrease vaccine reactogenicity, but can also increase vaccine efficacy. Furthermore, we show that changes in LPS composition can lead to an altered immune response. Overall, our studies provide several possible strategies that can be used to improve pertussis vaccine.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['The role of intrinsic spinal mechanisms in the pathogenesis of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis'],\n",
       "  'Description': [\"Despite numerous years of dedicated research into the origin of idiopathic scoliosis, the pathogenesis of this classic orthopaedic disorder has so far remained elusive. A striking feature of idiopathic scoliosis is the fact that it does not occur in vertebrates other than humans, despite many similarities in the basic architecture of the vertebral column across the species. From recent work by Castelein et al, it was demonstrated that the fully erect posture, which is unique to humans, significantly alters spinal loading conditions. It was shown that the backward inclined or 'declive' segments of the human spine are subject to dorsal shear loads. These dorsal shear loads are an important distinction between the human spine and the spine of all other vertebrates. In this thesis, it was postulated that excessive dorsal shear loads during the period of rapid growth, could lead to rotational instability of the declive segments of the spine. If progressive, these dorsal shear loads not only reduce rotational stability, but also can enhance a slight preexistent vertebral rotation. 1. In a biomechanical in vitro study on porcine and human spinal segments, we showed that at the mid and lower thoracic levels, significantly more vertebral rotation occurred under dorsal shear loads than under ventral shear loads. These data show that, in humans and in quadrupeds, the thoracic spine is less rotationally stable under dorsal shear loads than under ventral shear loads. We believe that these dorsally directed shear loads can, under critical circumstances during growth, introduce vertebral rotation, whereas ventrally directed loads counteract rotation. 2. The normal, nonscoliotic human spine shows a preexistent pattern of rotation in the transverse plane. The thoracic vertebrae are predominantly rotated to the right side, similar to what is seen in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. We believe that if the spine starts to decompensate into scoliosis, it seems logical that this built-in rotational pattern will be followed. 3. In neuromuscular scoliosis, it was demonstrated that despite the difference in origin, curve patterns in neuromuscular disease show many similarities with those in idiopathic scoliosis, such as a strong prevalence of right convex thoracic curves. We concluded that preexistent rotation, rather than muscle imbalance, also plays an important role in directing subsequent rotation in neuromuscular disease, as it does in idiopathic scoliosis. 4. We also showed the existence of a predominant rotation of the thoracic vertebrae to the right side in the quadruped spine, similar to what was found in humans. It was concluded that preexistent rotation can be considered as a physiological process in the normal development of the spine, independent of the pathogenesis of idiopathic scoliosis. 5. Finally, we demonstrated that the normal, nonscoliotic spine of humans with a complete mirror image reversal of the internal body organs (situs inversus totalis) shows a preexistent pattern of vertebral rotation opposite to what is seen in humans with normal organ anatomy. It was concluded that the asymmetrical anatomy of the thoracic organs is likely to play an important role in the development of this preexistent rotational tendency.\"],\n",

       "  'Title': [\"The adaptive immune response to cow's milk proteins in allergy and tolerance\"],\n",
       "  'Description': [\"Cow's milk (CM) and related products are an important source of protein in the diet. Unfortunately, cow's milk proteins (CMPs) can also be allergenic. IgE-mediated cow's milk allergy (CMA) occurs in 1.5% of infants, as well as in 0.3% of older children and adults. Insight into the immune response towards CMP in CMA, as well as in tolerant individuals, may provide targets for therapeutic strategies. CMP-specific T cells recognize small fragments of CMPs, known as T cell epitopes. T cells from children with CMA and tolerant children were observed to recognize essentially the same T cell epitopes in alfa-s1-casein, the most abundant CMP. This indicates that CMA is not caused by differential recognition of selective epitopes. The human leucocyte antigen (HLA) genes determine which CMP fragments are presented to T cells. No major differences were found in allele frequencies of HLA genes between subjects with CMA and tolerant individuals, suggesting that these genes do not contribute significantly to the genetic predisposition underlying CMA. CMP-induced production of interleukin-10 (IL-10) by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), as well as plasma levels of CMP-specific IgG4, were higher in adults sensitized to CM but without CMA, than in non-atopic adults. The upregulation of the immunoregulatory cytokine IL-10 may be needed to balance the CMP-specific immune response in an atopic environment, and may play a role in tolerance to CM in sensitized adults without CMA by counter-regulating specific IgE and IgG4. In line with this hypothesis, it was observed that CMP-specific IgG4 was also higher in atopic children and adults without CMA or sensitization to CM, as compared to non-atopic individuals. Specific IgG for the causative allergen is higher in CMA than in peanut allergy (PA) and birch bollen allergy (BPA), whereas specific IgE levels are comparable. Allergen-specific IgG in CMA appears to reduce the binding of allergen-Ig complexes to B cells, and may hereby inhibit IgE-facilitated allergen presentation (IgE-FAP) to specific T cells. Feedback enhancement of the specific Th2 response by IgE-FAP may therefore be less prominent in CMA than in allergies characterized by low specific IgG, such as BPA. Lastly, a possible prophylactic treatment for atopic disease was investigated. A hypo-allergenic whey formula was supplemented with a prebiotic oligosaccharide mixture (GOS/FOS) and fed to infants at risk for development of atopic disease. GOS/FOS supplementation appeared to specifically modulate the immune response towards food antigens, while leaving the response to pathogens intact. The decreased CMP-specific IgG1 response in treated infants suggests a suppression of the immune response to CMP, which may decrease the risk for development of CMA. The balance between specific IgE and IgG appears to be decisive for the development of CMA or tolerance. Peptides spanning immunodominant sequences in alfa-s1-casein and other major CM allergens could be a good candidate for application in tolerance-inducing therapy in CMA. This may induce an immune response comparable to that observed in atopic subjects without CMA, which is characterized by high IL-10 production by CMP-specific T cells, associated with low specific IgE and high IgG4.\"],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Body as Crisis. Representation of Pain in Visual Arts'],\n",
       "  'Description': [\"Pain is a highly problematic concept for a scholarly dissertation. It is thought to shatter consciousness and identity; it is often claimed that intense pain cannot be processed and that it escapes language. Pain has become a sort of acquired incapacity to communicate across the border between two worlds - the painless one and the one of pain. My argument, however, is that the making (as opposed to unmaking) aspect of pain can serve as one of the elements of subjectivity. I see the presence of pain as a dynamically shaping, rather than a passive, condition. People in pain live multiple, layered identities played out at crossroads of social, historical and political factors. Although disability and pain make it hard to secure, those identities are reproduced and reassured in the artworks I analyze. For my dissertation, art and gender constitute two large intersecting areas of cultural research. Establishing a link between embodied gender and representational strategies is crucial to my reading of women's art on pain. Art and literature offer an alternative to medical terminology for describing one's experience with illness. My intention is not only to show how pervasive of a presence pain is in artistic discourse, but also to point out the ways in which pain is being made visible here. In addressing visual culture, my methodological assumption is that we can derive certain forms of knowledge on pain from visual images. As pain does not produce a homogenous group of bodies who are together in their pain, all of my three cases are meant to reveal the particularity of painful experience and to fight against universalization, and therefore a commodification, of suffering. The art of Mexican painter Frida Kahlo, American photographer Cindy Sherman and Polish sculptor Alina Szapocznikow propose the whole complexity of embodied difference. By examining sculptures, paintings and photographs and by discussing critics and art historians' commentaries on them, I investigate how reading the images of pain, particularly connected to the female body, affects contemporary self-understanding. I look at the case of pain resulting from material, specified tissue damage, at the less “straightforward” pain that is a symptom of mental condition and the most complex pain resulting from traumatic, collective past experiences, combined with an unstoppable terminal illness. Chapter One (Kahlo) focuses mostly on the representational techniques used to convey the experience of pain and the mapping of the subject that suffers in relation to its positioning in the society. Chapter Two (Sherman) engages in the problem of the general perception of pain as a result of physical tissue damage and the challenging of that perception by feminist theory. Chapter Three (Szapocznikow) addresses the concept of situating pain in time and space: the memory of pain, its anticipation, its recalling and the possibility of sharing pain across the bodies. The conclusion of the work on pain inevitably poses the question of ethical consequences of viewing the subject in pain. The crisis in the title of this work is not only about the crisis of the body brought about by pain, but also the crisis of representation, language and perception. Instead of basing this work on the notion of stable; female identity, I introduce crisis as a chance for discontinuity and non-fixity of voice of the female subject.\"],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Current guidelines promote the use of native arteriovenous fistulas (AVF) as first choice access over ePTFE grafts and central venous catheters, because of favourable complication and patency rates. However, prevalent AVF use shows enormous differences among national and regional practice surveys, even after adjusting for demographics. ePTFE grafts are characterized by stenosis formation at the venous anastomosis. However, due to the global diabetes epidemic and the abundant presence of cardiovascular disease in the ageing hemodialysis population, ePTFE grafts are likely to play an increasingly important role in the future. In a review, (inter)national practice pattern differences were discussed and actions were presented that potentially increase AVF use and improve vascular access outcomes. In 11 dialysis facilities, a guidelines implementation program, CIMINO (Care Improvement by Multidisciplinary approach for Increase of Native vascular access Obtainment) demonstrated that prevalent AVF use was increased quicker in comparison to a 22 center control group. These changes were predominantly observed in clinics where AVF use was less than 75% at the start of the observation period. Furthermore, AVF use displayed a wide range among the participating centers but these ranges narrowed during the project. In 395 hemodialysis patients, a 33% primary AVF failure rate was observed. Female gender, duration of renal replacement therapy prior to access placement, diabetes mellitus, and AVF placement at the wrist (in comparison to the elbow) were associated with the risk of primary failure. Primary failure varied from 8-50% between participating hospitals and was strongly related to the hospital of vascular access placement. In 491 AVFs, we showed that AVF patency (from surgical creation date) and functional patency (from date of first cannulation) are markedly different. This difference appears to be caused by high primary failure rates. Primary functional patency was decreased in diabetics. Secondary failure varied from 0-38% among participating hospitals and was not related to patient characteristics or cardiovascular risk factors. Compared to eight hospitals with a low secondary failure rate combined, three hospitals had a significantly higher risk for secondary failure. After achieving adequacy for hemodialysis, baseline access blood flow was lower in AVFs that failed during follow up. These values were different for forearm and upper arm AVFs. In untreated AVFs access blood flow (Qa) did not change from five months after creation. Forearm AVF Qa was inversely associated with diabetes mellitus and decreasing BMI. In upper arm AVFs, no relations with risk factors were found The 6-month primary patency rate of 20 helical Swirlgrafts™ was similar to standard ePTFE AV-grafts, but assisted primary (84%) and secondary patency (100%) rates are at the highest end of reported series. Angiographic examination in a limited number of grafts suggested reduction of helical geometry at or after implantation, implying a function like conventional ePTFE prostheses. Compared to conventional angioplasty alone, a single treatment with cryoplasty reduced the intima-media ratio at the venous anastomosis of bilateral arteriovenous grafts in 4 pigs, without obvious signs of adverse effects on graft flow or venous remodeling.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Pancreatic cancer is a devastating disease. Most pancreatic cancers (approximately 85%) are diagnosed at a late, incurable stage. The poor prognosis and late presentation of pancreatic cancer patients underscore the importance of early detection, which is the sine qua non for the fight against pancreatic cancer. It is hoped for the future that the understanding of genetic alterations will lead to the rapid discovery of an effective biomarker of pancreatic carcinogenesis. In this thesis we visited the publicly available online SAGE libraries to evaluate global gene expression in pancreatic cancer and to select novel differentially expressed genes that might serve as diagnostic markers or as a lead for further research to therapeutic targets. We confirmed the differential expression of seven genes, involved in multiple cellular processes such as signal transduction (MIC-1), differentiation (DMBT1 and Neugrin), immune response (CD74), inflammation (CXCL2), cell cycle (CEB1) and enzymatic activity (Kallikrein 6). To provide an additional set of novel potential biomarkers for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma we used bioinformatics tools to reanalyze microarray data in the setting of pancreatic cancer. We characterized 60 previously unassigned ESTs (expressed sequence tags) and mapped most of them to known genes. The differential expression of a subset of genes was confirmed at the protein level by immunohistochemical labeling of tissue microarrays (Inhibin Beta A and CD29) and/or at the transcript level by RT-PCR (Inhibin Beta A, AKAP12, ELK3, EIF5A2, and EFNA5). In addition, we studied the expression and prognostic significance of 14-3-3sigma and ERM family protein expression in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas. The protein expression was significantly more common in poorly differentiated pancreatic cancers. Moreover, we showed that pancreatic cancer is a promising cancer type to explore novel chemotherapeutic strategies to exploit the selective loss of MTAP function. We found that immunolabeling for the MTAP gene product mirrored gene status and that approximately 30% of infiltrating pancreatic adenocarcinomas had complete loss of MTAP expression. In the future, those patients whose cancers show a complete loss of MTAP expression could be offered treatment with inhibitors of the de novo purine synthesis pathway. In addition, we immunolabeled a series of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) lesions of various histologic grades for the p16 and MTAP gene products using a high-throughput PanIN tissue microarray format. We demonstrated concordant loss of p16 and MTAP protein expression in 6/73 (8%) PanINs, including five high-grade lesions and one low-grade lesion. The concordant loss of expression of both genes in PanIN lesions demonstrated that homozygous deletions of the p16 tumor suppressor gene can occur in noninvasive precursor lesions. In summary, in this thesis we described potential clinically useful biomarkers for pancreatic carcinogenesis, discovered by analyzing unique cancer specific genetic alterations, differential expressed mRNA genes and protein changes in pancreatic cancer. Our increased knowledge of the molecular changes in pancreatic cancer and in different PanIN stages may provide the basis for developing more sensitive screening strategies for early detection, to achieve or final goal; “catching the horse before it has fled the barn”.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Cancer is the result of a disturbed balance between cell division and growth on one hand, and programmed cell death on the other. Crucial cellular processes such as proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation are regulated by a complex network of signal transduction pathways. Therefore, cancer can be viewed as a disease of deregulated signal transduction: cancer cells grow when they should not and do not die (i.e. undergo apoptosis) when they should. Elucidation of disturbed signal transduction pathways involved in the carcinogenic process, both at the protein and the genomic level, is therefore critical for the identification of new targets for cancer treatment. The phosphoinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)-protein kinase B (PKB) signalling pathway is crucial to many aspects of cell growth and survival. Deregulation of PI3K and PKB occurs by a variety of mechanisms in a large percentage of human tumours. Furthermore, aberrant PKB signalling not only plays a role in cancer onset and progression but it has also been suggested to play a role in other pathological conditions such as obesity, diabetes and premature aging. Together, these facts have made the elucidation of the PI3K-PKB pathway the subject of many studies. In recent years, targeted deletion of specific isoforms of PKB in mice has proved to be a powerful tool for elucidating the physiological roles of PKB proteins, as well as the redundancy and specific functions of the different isoforms. These mice knockout studies support a role of PKB in metabolism, glycolysis, insulin signalling, growth, vascularisation and lipid metabolism. Some of the PKB substrates that mediate these processes have been identified. For example, it has been shown that PKB directly phosphorylates and inhibits members of the FOXO subfamily of forkhead transcription factors. Interestingly, broad somatic deletion of FOXO transcription factors results in a progressive cancer-prone condition, indicating that these proteins function as tumour suppressors. Regulation of the activity of FOXO transcription factors is thus a critical means through which PKB modulates cellular homeostasis. The continued elucidation of the role of the PI3K-PKB pathway in cell growth, survival, and proliferation has shed light on why regulation of this pathway is often altered within tumours. The prevalence of a hyperactivated PI3K-PKB pathway in human cancers suggests that cancer cells might be more sensitive to inhibitors of this pathway than normal cells. The continuing efforts to develop specific, high-affinity inhibitors against the PI3K-PKB pathway have the potential to yield new therapeutics to treat human cancer. The identification and characterisation of PI3K/PKB-mediated signalling events opens opportunities for development of previously unrecognised targets for anti-cancer therapeutics. Therefore in this thesis we have focussed on the identification and characterisation of novel signalling components downstream of PKB. We have specifically focussed on the role of PKB in cell survival and have performed phosphoproteomic and microarray analysis to identify novel downstream phosphorylation and transcriptional targets. This thesis is part of ongoing research into clarifying the specific role PKB plays in oncogenic transformation.'],\n",

       "  'Description': [\"Unheard of; the problem of appropriate care provision for psychotic patients from different ethnic backgrounds \\r\\n\\r\\nTherapy non-compliance and drop-out are major concerns in the treatment of psychotic patients from ethnic minority groups. Kleinman (1980) developed a theory according to which Explanatory Models (EM's) play an important role in such problems. Discrepancies between the EM's of the professional caregiver and the patient and/or his social network can cause misunderstandings on both sides, leading - especially when there are large cultural differences - to treatment that is experienced as inappropriate or irrelevant. The importance of EM's has been a theme of many authors since Kleinman. However, the role of discrepancies between the EM's of caregivers and patients has not yet been systematically investigated for different diagnostic categories and different ethnic groups. The aim of this study is to enrich and develop the theory in the case of psychotic patients from certain minority ethnic groups in The Netherlands, by assessing the importance of EM's to appropriate care delivery for these patients. Twenty-one Dutch, 17 Surinamese-Hindustani and 16 Turkish psychotic patients were interviewed in their homes with a topic list relating to their Explanatory Model(s), social network, coping or help-seeking strategies, and their satisfaction with the treatment they received. The caregivers of all these patients were also interviewed separately concerning the same topics, using the same method. Ten patients from each group were also interviewed together with their family and their caregiver. These interviews were also video-recorded, transcribed and described. All the written reports and transcriptions were subsequently analysed using the method of Grounded Theory. The most important conclusions of this research are firstly, the crucial role of negative social factors in the life of patients and in the presentation of their narratives. These narratives concerned life problems and, far less often, psychotic disorders. Secondly, the relevance of Explanatory Models. How useful are they, taking into account that they are usually expressed in a fragmentary and strategic way, and that congruence of EM's does not seem to be an essential ingredient of care that is experienced as appropriate? We propose that EM's should be regarded as an instrument for initiating and sustaining a discussion between the caregiver and patient and relatives. The third topic of importance in this research is the major cause of poorly-matched care: the biodeterministic model that is adhered to by most caregivers, in particular nurses. This model encourages caregivers to neglect the social context of their patients. In our view, the aim of treatment should be to prevent the patient from falling even further into poverty and isolation, rather than simply keeping the psychotic symptoms under control. Particularly for ethnic minority patients, the neglect of the social situation has disastrous consequences. The prospect of treatment for this difficult group of patients which is not labour-intensive and therefore relatively inexpensive, seems to have been irresistible for policymakers in mental health care. This 'health care on the cheap', however, has led to care for chronic psychotic patients that is characterised by the problems described in this thesis: lack of attention from caregivers and an excessive emphasis on biological factors. This results in inadequate concern for the social context and experiences of patients and their relatives, poorly matched care (especially for patients from the ethnic minority groups studied here) and for many patients, severe degeneration.\\r\\n \\r\\nEen handelsversie van dit werk is beschikbaar is bij Garant uitgevers, Antwerpen/Apeldoorn)\"],\n",

       "  'Title': ['CYP2D6 and HTR2C polymorphisms in psychiatric pharmacotherapy'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Antipsychotic and antidepressant drugs are used by the majority of psychiatric patients. The response to these drugs is variable: approximately 20-40% of the psychiatric patients do not respond satisfactorily to pharmacotherapy. In psychiatric pharmacotherapy there usually is a lag time of several weeks before the balance between the therapeutic response and the prevalence of adverse events can be evaluated. This lag time together with the high prevalence of clinically relevant adverse events put psychiatric patients at risk of discontinuing pharmacotherapy. These complications make pharmacogenetics a potentially promising tool in individualising psychiatric pharmacotherapy. Pharmacogenetics has been defined as the research area investigating whether and to what extent genetic variation can explain and predict the response to drugs of individual patients. Determining a patient’s genotype before initiating pharmacotherapy may prevent unsatisfactory response because an individualised advice for the choice of drug and dosage is possible. In this thesis two polymorphisms (CYP2D6 and HTR2C) that might be useful from this perspective in the future will be described. The main objective of this thesis is to elucidate whether polymorphisms in the gene coding for cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) and the serotonin 2C (HTR2C) receptor are associated with unsatisfactory response of pharmacotherapy in daily psychiatric practice. Unsatisfactory response encompasses both failure of treatment success and unacceptable adverse events. The first part of this thesis describes the association between CYP2D6 genotype (genetic variation in pharmacokinetics) and global clinical response of both antidepressant and antipsychotic drugs in daily psychiatric practice. The results show that Poor Metabolisers (PM) for CYP2D6 have an increased risk for serum concentrations of antipsychotic and antidepressant drugs outside the presumed therapeutic window compared to Extensive Metabolisers (EM) for CYP2D6. Furthermore, we found that for antidepressant drugs CYP2D6 genotype PM was associated with more frequent switching and with more dosage regimen changes compared to CYP2D6 genotype EM. For antipsychotic drugs an increased risk of changes in dosage regimen and an increased frequency of prescription of antiparkinsonian drugs for treatment of extrapyramidal syndromes (EPS) was found for CYP2D6 genotype PM compared to CYP2D6 genotype EM. The second part of this thesis describes the association between HTR2C genotypes (genetic variation in pharmacodynamics) and metabolic abnormalities in patients using antipsychotic drugs. The results show that HTR2C polymorphisms are associated with an increased risk of the occurrence of obesity and the metabolic syndrome in patients using antipsychotics. The association with the metabolic syndrome is particularly strong in carriers of the HTR2C rs1414334 C allele using clozapine or risperidone. The association between CYP2D6 and HTR2C polymorphisms and unsatisfactory response to psychiatric pharmacotherapy show promising results. There are many challenges in genetic pharmacoepidemiology, genotype translation and application in daily clinical practice that has to be overcome before pharmacogenetic testing (among others CYP2D6 and HTR2C genotypes) will enter daily clinical practice. However, potential solutions are evolving rapidly and hopefully these obstacles will be overcome and pharmacogenetics will enter and improve the treatment of individual patients in the near future.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Schistosomes are parasitic worms that cause schistosomiasis, a chronic disease associated with a Th2 response. During the chronic phase of infection the disease is also associated with enhanced IL-10 production and suppressed T cell proliferation against parasite and third party antigens. The tegumental outer-surface structure of schistosomes is unique in nature and consists of a syncytium of fused cells covered by two closely-apposed lipid bilayers that form the interactive surface with the host. Schistosome-specific lysophosphatidylserine (lysoGPSer) activates toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and affects dendritic cells in such a way that mature dendritic cells gain the ability to induce the development of IL-10 producing regulatory T cells. We present a novel HPLC-MS/MS method that separates molecular species of all phospholipid classes in one single run. Using this method, more that 400 phospholipid species were identified and quantified in crude lipid extracts from Schistosoma mansoni. Furthermore, we analysed the phospholipid species composition of phosphatidylserine and lysophospholipids in adult worms, in isolated tegumental membranes of adult schistosomes and in blood cells of the host. It was shown that the tegument comprises many schistosome-specific and tegument-specific phospholipids. We also show that lysophosphatidylserine species with saturated acyl chains containing 16 to 20 carbon atoms have very poor activating capacity, while long chain lysophosphatidyl species (22 carbon atoms of longer) have a potent TLR2 activating capacity. Finally, we show the effect of schistosomal lipid fractions on the immune system of Gabonese children living in an area endemic for schistosomiasis. A lipid fraction contained lysophospahtidylserine (lysoGPSer) plus diacylphosphatidylserine (GPSer) while the other one contained lysoGPSer and only a trace of GPSer. The effect of the lipid fractions was compared with commercial available TLR2 ligands. LysoGPSer plus GPSer was shown to have different immunological effects compared to lysoGPser.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Boundary conditions for cartilage regeneration'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Cartilage defects generally do not heal and may result in osteoarthritis (OA) development. Unfortunately, current treatment strategies result in repair tissue with insufficient structural and mechanical properties as compared to native cartilage, and, therefore, are thought to provide merely a temporary alleviation of symptoms and insufficient protection against osteoarthritis (OA) development. This composes a strong driving force for the rapid development of the field of regenerative medicine and the application of such strategies to the treatment of cartilage defects. The first clinical studies have reported promising results. As a result, cartilage regeneration techniques, such as ACI, are increasingly applied, although microfracturing is still considered the treatment of choice for articular cartilage defects by many surgeons as the full scope of information needed for final evaluation of the efficacy of cartilage regeneration techniques remains to be provided in prospective randomized clinical trials. Furthermore, a discrepancy in reliability and reproducibility of cartilage regeneration techniques has been observed when comparing the outcome of culture techniques and animal models with clinically applied ACI. This suggests that we need to explore the boundary conditions that determine these discrepancies. In this thesis, we have clearly demonstrated the superior structural repair resulting from ACI as compared to the traditionally used microfracturing technique. However, one should realize that these beneficial results were found under strict trial conditions with accurately defined in- and exclusion criteria based on previously reported trials. Still, we found that ACI resulted in morphologically variable regeneration tissue-quality, which led us to the subject of this thesis: “exploring the boundaries of successful cartilage regeneration”. In our effort to acquire adequate regenerative conditions, we established that in future clinically applied ACI, chondrocytes should be expanded under growth factor supplemented conditions. Furthermore, upon refining the surgical techniques, scaffold materials should not only be considered for practical reasons, but also because they may significantly enhance the process of chondrogenesis. Further optimization may be attained by in vitro and in vivo experiments comparing the influence of different scaffold materials on cartilage regeneration by expanded and implanted chondrocytes. Besides the culture conditions, we demonstrated the importance of selecting patients with sufficient donor tissue quality. Until the substantial differences in chondrogenic potency between healthy and OA chondrocytes can be overcome, ACI should not be implemented for the treatment of early OA. In addition, effort should be put into elucidating the transition from cartilage defects towards the development of OA and how this affects donor tissue characteristics, as this increases insight into adequate treatment timing and patient selection. Lastly, we have demonstrated that transferring clinically relevant variables, such as SF from injured knee joints, to the “controlled” environment of in vitro experiments significantly alters the process of cartilage regeneration. Therefore, exploring the variables of this environment will likely elucidate mediators unfavorable to in vivo cartilage regeneration. These mediators may provide feasible targets for optimization of joint homeostasis by pre-treating a damaged joint before implementing ACI. Among others, IL-1B might be such a target, as this pro-inflammatory cytokine has proven to be of key importance during wound repair throughout different tissue types in the human body. The biological efficacy of a newly developed autologous form of IL-1ra was demonstrated by clinical improvement found in patients with symptomatic knee OA. Whether this treatment modality actually results in improved cartilage regeneration remains to be proven. In conclusion, the aim of this thesis was to establish the position and to determine the boundary conditions of cartilage regeneration techniques for the treatment of articular cartilage defects. Based on our results, ACI should now be considered a first approach rather than a last resort for the treatment of articular cartilage defects. Still, we have demonstrated the significant impact of clinically relevant parameters on the outcome of these treatment strategies. Clarifying and targeting the mediators that account for the observed detrimental effects, have the potential to provide the key in our ongoing effort to enhance the clinical outcome of cartilage regeneration techniques.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The work presented in this thesis demonstrates live high resolution 3D imaging of tissue in its native state and environment. The nonlinear interaction between focussed femtosecond light pulses and the biological tissue results in the emission of natural autofluorescence and second-harmonic signal. Because biological intrinsic emission is generally very weak and extends from the ultraviolet to the visible spectral range, a broad-spectral range and high sensitivity 3D spectral imaging system is developed. Imaging the spectral characteristics of the biological intrinsic emission reveals the structure and biochemistry of the cells and extra-cellular components. By using different methods in visualizing the spectral images, discrimination between different tissue structures is achieved without the use of any stain or fluorescent label. For instance, RGB real color spectral images of the intrinsic emission of mouse skin tissues show blue cells, green hair follicles, and purple collagen fibers. The color signature of each tissue component is directly related to its characteristic emission spectrum. The results of this study show that skin tissue nonlinear intrinsic emission is mainly due to the autofluorescence of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate), flavins, keratin, melanin, phospholipids, elastin and collagen and nonlinear Raman scattering and second-harmonic generation in Type I collagen. In vivo time-lapse spectral imaging is implemented to study metabolic changes in epidermal cells in tissues. Optical scattering in tissues, a key factor in determining the maximum achievable imaging depth, is also investigated in this work.'],\n",

To re-evaluate the association between the Glu298Asp polymorphism and CAD in Caucasian population by performing a meta-analysis of all published case-control studies. Methods and Results: We searched Medline and Embase for articles about the Glu298Asp polymorphism and CAD, until September 2003. We found 20 studies and included 13 cases-control series from 8 studies in Caucasian, contained 7998 patients with CAD and 5471 healthy controls. The overall frequencies for TT, GT, and GG genotype were 12.6%, 43.0% 44.4% in cases, and 10.2%, 44.7%, and 45.1% in controls, respectively. The overall distribution of T allele in the case and control subjects was 34.1% and 32.5%. The pooled estimate odds ratio of CAD by use of Dersimonian and Laird's random effects model was 1.11 (95% CI: 0.94, 1.30) for TT versus GG, and 1.12 (0.98, 1.28) for TT versus GT and GG combined. Conclusions: Our finding in a meta-analysis of 13 independent case-control studies, argued against the hypothesis that the eNOS Glu298Asp polymorphism is a major risk factor for coronary artery disease in the Caucasian population.\"],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Cardiovascular disease is a major contributor of disability and death. 1 Development of atherosclerosis is the main underlying mechanism leading to the occurrence of vascular diseases. 2;3 Atherosclerosis tends to develop slowly and gradually over the years and remains subclinical, i.e., a-symptomatic for a long time. 4 Only when lesions or plaques rupture, acute symptoms occur, leading to disability or death. Indeed for a large proportion of the population sudden death is the only symptom from atherosclerosis development. 5 Traditionally, cardiovascular epidemiology focused on the relation between etiologic factors, i.e., vascular risk factors, and the occurrence of vascular events. In the past decades a shift has been made from events towards atherosclerosis, since the ability to obtain information on the atherosclerotic process using minimal or non-invasive approaches has dramatically increased. 6-9 This has lead to a large number of studies into the role of etiologic factors on subclinical atherosclerosis development, and studies on the presence and extent of subclinical atherosclerosis as a predictor of future events. In addition, studies have been launched to investigate the additional value of subclinical atherosclerosis measurements in the risk profiling of subjects. 10-12 Moreover, measurements of change in subclinical atherosclerosis are currently used in randomized controlled trials on the efficacy of drug treatment. 13;14 At present there are several possibilities to assess atherosclerosis in a minimal or non-invasive approach as have been detailed in several reviews. 9;15-19 This includes for example ultrasound with measurement of (carotid) intima-media thickness (CIMT) 15, and plaques 16, magnetic resonance imaging 17 with measurement of plaques and plaque tissue characteristics and computed tomography 18;19 with measurement of arterial calcifications. Electron-beam computed tomography (EBCT) has been shown to be able to measure calcium deposits in the coronary arteries. These deposits have been validated with pathological anatomical specimens and shown to indeed reflect atherosclerosis in the coronary arteries. Although data on coronary calcium has mainly come from studies using EBCT, nowadays multi detector CT (MDCT) is much more widely available and also allows for measurement of coronary calcium. The present thesis focuses on various aspects of the coronary calcium measurements on which information is not widely present. This includes studies into the reproducibility of the coronary calcium measurements by MDCT (chapter 2). Furthermore, several studies on the relation of presence and/or change in risk factors over time to coronary calcium and also the relation of risk factors to segment specific coronary calcium (chapter 3). In chapter 4 we examined the relation between coronary calcium and other marker of myocardial damage. Finally, the findings presented in this thesis are being put into perspective (chapter 5).'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Coinfections with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) during HIV-infection are a major problem in African countries because they lead to a higher death rate. In this thesis we investigated the interaction and the immunological consequences of HIV/TB coinfection. \\r\\n\\n\\r\\nFirst we focussed on the burden of HIV-infection in TB patients and its impact on screening and diagnostic methods of MTB. (part I) We demonstrate a high rate of HIV-infection among suspected TB patients, although still a lot of coinfected cases might be missed due to lower sensitivity of the diagnostic tests, which increases the risk of transmission of TB in the community.To study the impact of HIV-infection on clinical read-outs of MTB infection further, we determined the in vivo tuberculin PPD skin test reactivity, positivity and conversion rate in adult HIV-infected and non-infected Ethiopians. We observed lower PPD skin test positivity rate among clinically diagnosed MTB-infected adults with and without HIV-infection in Ethiopia, which suggests the need for other sensitive methods to detect active TB cases, particularly among HIV positives.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTo study the immunological consequences of HIV-MTB coinfection, we examined immune activation parameters and disease progression. (part II) We analysed the expression of chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 on CD4+ T-cells and plasma chemokine levels among TB patients with HIV co-infection during the first 2 months of anti-TB treatment. We showed that increased expression of CCR5 and CXCR4 on activated CD4+ T-cell population coupled with persistently elevated chemokines may provide a suitable condition for continuous replication of HIV associated with TB co-infection. To investigate immune activation, proliferation rate of T cell subsets was analyzed among HIV/TB (n=21), HIV (n=23), TB (n=20) and Healthy controls (n=20). A seven, three and twofold-increased rate of proliferation was observed on CD4+ T cells in HIV-TB (13.7%), HIV (6.6%) and TB (3.7%) infected individuals, respectively compared to healthy controls (1.9%). This implies that coinfected individuals experience even more activation of their immune system. Interestingly, analyses of HIV-infected individuals who were followed before and after development of clinical active tuberculosis disease, showed a sustained/increased level of immune activation level paralleling the level of plasma viral RNA level and a progressive loss of CD4+ T cells. Thus, unlike in Caucasians, sustained level of immune activation in African HIV/TB coinfected patients despite anti-TB treatment will lead to the absence of immune restoration and reduction in plasma viral RNA level. Furthermore we analysed the level of regulatory T cells and found that these were increased in chronically ill HIV/TB patients. The level of Tregs correlated positively with HIV viral load and immune activation markers, thereby suggesting that these Tregs are antigen-dependent.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nFinally, we analysed disease progression and outcomes of HIV/TB coinfection. (part III) The slow CD4-decline in HIV-infected Ethiopians compared to their Caucasian counterparts was explained by lower immune activation levels in the Ethiopians. Survival rate analysis of HIV/TB coinfected individuals before and after implementation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) showed that although survival increased due to ART, however mortality is still higher in HIV-infected compared to HIV uninfected TB patients.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['The Hellenistic Royal Court. Court Culture, Ceremonial and Ideology in Greece, Egypt and the Near East, 336-30 BCE'],\n",
       "  'Description': [\"In the Hellenistic empires of Alexander the Great and his successors in Greece, Egypt and the Near East, new forms of court culture and political ideology developed during the last three centuries BCE. Appropriated by Parthian kings and Roman emperors alike, the culture of these Macedonian courts eventually influenced the evolution of royal ideology and court culture in both western Europe and the Islamic East. In this first all-embracing study of the Hellenistic royal court the author endeavours to explain, among other things, the success and long life of Hellenistic royal culture. This study has a broad set-up. It discusses the social, cultural and formal aspects of court society, palace architecture, royal patronage of the arts and sciences, and monarchic representation. The focus is on the three principal Macedonian dynasties: the Antigonids (Macedonia and Greece), Ptolemies (Egypt and the eastern Mediterranean) and Seleukids (Asia Minor, the Near East and Iran). , In Chapter 1 (titled 'Court, kingship and ideology') the methodological en theoretical framework is set out, using recent literature about court culture, state formation and political representation in varying cultures and periods. Hellenistic kingship is defined by the centrality of war and conquest in both ideology and practice. Chapter 2 ('Palaces') discusses the architecture and decoration of royal residences, accentuating the ideological implications, particularly regarding the connection of (royal) palace and (autonomous) city. Chapter 3 ('Court society') discusses the social, formal and political aspects of the court: the courtiers (the so-called 'friends of the king'), the royal family, giving i.a. new interpretations of the position of the queen and the crown prince, as well as the dynamics of faction and succession strife. In Chapter 4 ('Cultural and scientific patronage') a new explanation is given for the remarkable fact that the artistic and scientific life, notably, but not exclusively, at the Ptolemaic Museum at Alexandria, was characterised by intellectual freedom and a preference for innovation, leading e.g. to the formulation of heliocentric theory in astronomy, the first steam engine, the empirical examination of the human vascular and nervous system, and the development of new forms of poetry and scholarship. This chapter also discusses cultural interaction and the significance of the 'Hellenism' of the courts for royal imperial rule. Chapter 4 ('Ritual and ceremonial') extensively deals with public representation: inauguration rituals, ceremonial entries into cities, religious festivals and processions. It will be shown that ritual and ceremonial emphasised the divinity of the ruler, particularly his role as a victorious saviour and bringer of peace, prosperity and order. In the last chapter ('Synthesis: A Golden Age') it is argued, contrary to prevailing opinion, that the Hellenistic monarchies followed the example of their Mesopotamian, Persian and Egyptian predecessors of claiming absolute rulership over world empires that knew no limits. As they also incorporated more 'individualistic' or 'western' aspects of kingship from Greco-Macedonian tradition, the Hellenistic empires developed a form of monarchical representation that was suitable to serve as the foundation for the imperial ideology of the Roman Empire succeeding them.\"],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Anorexia Nervosa (AN) is a psychosomatic eating disorder of unknown aetiology, which primarily affects adolescent girls and young women and is characterized by aberrant patterns of eating behaviour and weight regulation which result in weight loss and endocrine abnormalities such as amenorrhea, disturbances in attitude and perception about weight and shape, and an intense fear of gaining weight. This thesis is based upon a follow up cohort study of 61 young girls and women consecutively referred to two specialized eating disorder treatment centres, one for adolescents (at the Dept. of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry of the University Medical Centre Utrecht) and one for adults (Rintveld, centre for Eating Disorders, Altrecht Mental Health Institute). The study focused on psychoneuroendocrinological changes during treatment; changes in body weight and composition, in hormones, activity level and mood states. After a follow-up of maximum one year, the patients were divided into 3 groups according to their clinical status: no weight recovery and ongoing amenorrhea (NWR, nineteen patients), weight recovery but with ongoing amenorrhea (WR, eighteen patients), and weight and cycle recovery (WCR, twenty-four patients). Approximately 5 years after the first admission a follow up was conducted to investigate the current state of illness as well as to identify potential predictors of recovery. All hormones changed over time with weight gain, with ACTH being the only exception to this rule. If normal values were reached this occurred in the WCR group only. Several factors predicted and influenced complete physical recovery in the first year. A novel finding is that the ovarian markers AMH, Inhibin B together with FSH predict which participants will regain a regular menstrual cycle with weight gain. Leptin levels did predict physical recovery, we detected a threshold level; an initial leptin level > 2 microgr./L increased chances for a full recovery to 75%. We replicated the finding by Holtkamp et al. (2006) that hyperactivity is related to leptin in the acute stage of AN but only when we compared an age matched group, the youngest patients in this study. Activity levels however are not predictive for treatment outcome in the first year in our study sample. Interestingly, chances for a patient that shows recovery in the first year, to relapse at 5 years are correlated with leptin and activity level at T1, a novel finding. Without physical recovery there is no psychological recovery, but the factors that influence psychological recovery need further study. Although at 5 years FU 59% of the participants had become physically recovered and 52% did not meet criteria for an eating disorder, many still spent a lot of time and energy on thoughts concerning food or their body. Most striking are the data on the anxiety and depressive symptoms that are in line with the findings of Herpertz-Dahlmann and colleagues (2001).'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The ability to visualize the perfusion territories of the brain feeding arteries is important for many clinical applications. Recently, selective arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI has been introduced as the first method capable to visualize the perfusion territories of the brain in-vivo. In this thesis we describe the possibilities of selective ASL MRI and show the importance of perfusion territory information in studying the cerebral circulation in both patients with and without steno-occlusive disease. This most important findings of this thesis are twofold. Firstly, we demonstrate that the perfusion territories of the brain feeding arteries are considerably variable. Secondly, the variation in perfusion territories is mainly caused by anatomical variants of the circle of Willis, large artery steno-occlusive disease, or the combination of both. Thus far, the cerebral vascular territories are generally described as relatively invariant. Numerous standard atlases and textbooks show schematic drawings of the ‘normal’ territorial distribution. Most of these drawings are based on combinations of postmortem studies and assume a symmetrical and negligible variable territorial distribution. In contrast to these post-mortem studies, we demonstrated in-vivo that the variability of the cerebral perfusion territories is significantly greater than was previously assumed. The finding that the configuration of the circle of Willis strongly affects the extent of the cerebral perfusion territories seems relevant since up to 65% of healthy control subjects have an anatomical variant type. In addition to the large variability at the level of the circle of Willis, our results demonstrated that the presence of a severe stenosis or occlusion at the level of the arteries in the neck has major consequences for the distribution of the cerebral perfusion territories. Obstructive arterial disease at the level of the arteries in the neck is found in about 8% in the general healthy population, up to 30% in patients with symptomatic cerebral ischemia. The large variability of the cerebral territorial distribution demonstrated in this thesis has major implications for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of stroke. For example, physicians considering whether to treat acute stroke often use anatomic CT or MR images to assess affected vascular territories, and to determine whether infarction is embolic or hypotensive in nature. However, the results of this thesis demonstrate that neither the territories affected nor the nature of stroke can be accurately diagnosed on the basis of such anatomic studies. Currently used schematic drawings of the cerebral flow territories are based on standard atlases, and therefore give no certainty on the extent of the territories in the individual patient. To know more accurately the location of the perfusion territories, one should visualize them. In conclusion, the interaction of stenosis severity, multi-vessel disease, and vascular anatomy defines the location and the extent of the perfusion territories of the brain feeding arteries. To relate focal brain lesions to underlying perfusion territories in individual cases, knowledge of the territorial distribution is essential'],\n",

       "  'Description': [\"The thesis `Mathematical aspects of infectious disease dynamics' by Barbara Boldin is about model formulation, analysis and interpretation of four questions arising from biology or medicine. Suppose that a new population is introduced into a steady community. When the basic reproduction ratio R_0 of the invading population exceeds 1, the invader is able to grow, while the invasion fails when R_0 < 1. What happens when R_0 passes the critical value 1? We provide the answer to this question, assuming that the populations are characterized by finitely many characteristics and that the dynamics is described as a deterministic process, either in a form of a parametrized system of differential equations or a parametrized map. We observe that population models, regardless of the biology that underlies them, take a specific form, which implies that the transition through R_0 =1 corresponds to a transcritical bifurcation. In a biological context we distinguish two cases of transcritical bifurcation, according to whether the positive branch of equilibria is subcritical or supercritical. We provide a formula that enables us to distinguish between the two scenarios. Another subject studied in the thesis is the evolution of virulence. Pathogens are subject to natural selection at several different, but intertwined, levels. For instance, pathogens compete for resources within a single infected host, but also at the population level by competing for susceptible hosts. Increased reproduction inside a host may enhance transmission, but it may also increase host's mortality and consequently decrease transmission. Thus, the following question arises: how are these tendencies balanced in the course of evolution and to what extent do the two levels of reproduction influence the outcome? We study this question while relating the between-host dynamics to the dynamics inside a host. We couple the two levels of reproduction by incorporating the possibility of superinfection and study the evolution of the pathogen's within-host reproduction rate. The thesis also deals with the dynamics of pathogens found in intensive care units, such as Pseudomonas Aeruginosa and MRSA. Nosocomial infections are typically preceded by asymptomatic carriage at several body sites. Pathogen dynamics thus includes within-host transmission as well as transmission among patients. Different routes of transmission create a complex epidemiology, which is furthermore complicated by rapid patient turnover and small population sizes, typical for ICUs. We present a model that incorporates several colonization sites and evaluate the relative effects of barrier precautions and antibiotic prophylaxis on the prevalence of colonization. The last chapter of the thesis deals with the within-host dynamics of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) in piglets. ETEC causes post-weaning diarrhoea, a disease that can lead to severe deterioration or even death in newly weaned piglets. We present a model describing the microbial dynamics in the intestine of a single piglet. We determine the Malthusian parameter for the case a piglet is infected with a single dose of ETEC. Since piglets come into contact with faeces containing the bacteria, we furthermore investigate the case a piglet is reinfected with a fraction of the shed bacteria.\"],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Molecular epidemiology of heartwater (Ehrlichia ruminantium infection) in The Gambia'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Heartwater is caused by Ehrlichia ruminantium and transmitted by ticks of the genus Amblyomma. It occurs in sub-Saharan Africa and in the Caribbean and affects domestic ruminants. There is general lack of information on the epidemiology of the disease in The Gambia. Results of a countrywide serological survey (chapter 2) using MAP1-B ELISA showed the infection is widespread throughout the country and showed a gradient of increasing heartwater risk for susceptible livestock from the east to the west of The Gambia. In sheep, the highest seroprevalence was detected in the western part of the country, 88.1% in the Western Division and 62.1% in the Lower River Division. Similarly in goats, the highest seroprevalence was detected in the westerly part of the country, North Bank Division (59%) and Western Division (44.1%). Sheep and goats in the two easterly divisions (Central River and Upper River divisions) showed the lowest seroprevalence rates. In Chapter 3 the nested pCS20 PCR showed the highest detection performance for detection of E. ruminantium in Amblyomma variegatum ticks compared to the nested map1 PCR and reverse line blot hybridization. Application of the pCS20 PCR in a subsequent study of E. ruminantium tick infection rates in The Gambia showed infection rates ranged from 1.6 % to 15.1 % with higher prevalences detected at sites in the westerly divisions (Western, Lower River and North Bank) than sites in the easterly divisions (Central River and Upper River) of the country. The RLB, in addition, demonstrated molecular evidence of Ehrlichia ovina, Anaplasma ovis and Anaplasma marginale infections in The Gambia. Chapter 4 described longitudinal monitoring of E. ruminantium infection in extensively managed newborn lambs and kids using pCS20 PCR and MAP1-B ELISA. Infection rates detected by pCS20 PCR increased with increasing age. Half (7/14) of the newborn PCR-positive animals tested positive in the first 3 days after birth, suggesting that transmission other than by tick feeding had played a role. In contrast, seropositivity detected by MAP1-B ELISA declined with increasing age suggesting the presence of maternal antibodies. It is concluded that both the vector tick and vertical transmission may play a vital role in the epidemiology of heartwater in young animals; and showed the age range of 4 and 12 weeks corresponds to the period of highest susceptibility to heartwater in traditionally managed small ruminants. The study of genetic diversity of E. ruminantium by restriction fragment profile analysis of map1 gene is described in chapter 5. The results showed the presence of multiple genotypes (at least 11) of the E. ruminantium in the three agroecological zones of The Gambia, Sudano-Guinean (SG), Western Sudano-Sahelian (WSS) and Eastern Sudano-Sahelian (ESS) with the greatest number of diversity detected in the WSS and SG zones. Chapter 6 described the evaluation of an inactivated vaccine, prepared from E. ruminantium (Gardel stock), and a live attenuated vaccine from E. ruminantium (Senegal stock) against heartwater in Sahelian sheep. A local stock of E. ruminantium (Kerr Seringe) was used as challenge material. Inactivated and live attenuated vaccines provided 43 % and 100% protection, respectively, against virulent needle challenge. In a subsequent field trial, the attenuated vaccine protected 75% of sheep against virulent tick challenge, which was fatal for all control sheep.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['The biomechanical interaction between vertebral column and limbs in the horse: a kinematical study'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Nowadays, horses have to train and perform in high-level sportive and leisure activities. Injuries of the locomotor system with a decreased functionality or pain of the back are often seen in equine hospitals. In general, the relationship between limb and vertebral column function in mammals is complex and has been of scientific interest for long time. The age-old bow-and-string concept of the mammalian back, which implies that several body parts influence back motion (Barthez 1798; Slijper 1946), needed a detailed update. In horses, the origin and pathogenesis of back problems are difficult to predict with clinical examination alone, and thus deserves an objective evaluation and investigation. Modern gait analysis technology allows for an objective, more accurate and detailed analysis of body kinematics to study how limbs interact with vertebral column movement (Chapter-1). In Chapter-2 it was shown that changes in the head-and-neck position influence back kinematics. Lowering the head-and-neck flexes the vertebral column, while it increases range of motion (ROM); by lifting the head-and-neck the column extends and ROM becomes reduced. It was concluded that the low position of the head-and-neck increase vertebral movement. On the other hand, an extremely high head-and-neck position provokes reduced movement and an extended posture of the back. Back pain and lameness do coexist and commonly the primary cause of the problem is clinically found in the limbs. In Chapter-3 and-4 the relation between slight lameness and vertebral motion was investigated. It was shown that even subtle forelimb and hindlimb lameness provoke systematic changes in pelvic and thoracolumbar kinematics. Induced forelimb lameness provoked increased ROM and changed the pattern of thoracolumbar motion in the sagittal and horizontal planes. Hindlimb lameness resulted in hyperextension and increased ROM of the back, but also in a decreased ROM of the lumbosacral segment. All changes presumably are done in an attempt to unload the affected limb. In Chapters-5 and-6 it was shown that induced unilateral back pain affects back and limb kinematics. Vertebral ROM increased, the position of the back was more extended and showed increased lateral motion. However, the effect of back pain on limbs was rather minimal consisting in decreased flexion of some of the joints of all four limbs during swing phase. Thus, it can be assumed that primary back pain is unlikely to produce important changes in the limbs. In Chapter-7 the effect of chiropractic manipulations on horses with back pain was studied. Understanding the effect of back and limb pain experimentally, it could be hypothesized that treating back pain would induce biomechanical changes in the vertebral column. The main effect of the chiropractic manipulations was a less extended thoracic back, enhanced vertebral ROM, a reduced inclination of the pelvis and improvement of the symmetry of its motion. It can be concluded that there is a tight functional relationship between vertebral column and limbs. When pain is present in any component, the balance between them will be affected. In a similar way, when changes in posture are imposed to the horse the whole motion chain within the axial and appendicular skeleton will be influenced.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Context: * Many European countries are considering to extend recommendations for influenza vaccination to include otherwise healthy persons aged <65 years. However information about the potential impact of such extension is scarce, particularly for adults. Furthermore, the development of vaccines against RSV has progressed, and therefore insight into the RSV-associated burden is required. * Especially young children suffer from recurrent respiratory tract infections (RTI), with influenza viruses and Streptococcus pneumoniae as frequent pathogens. Evaluation of influenza vaccination with or without pneumococcal conjugate vaccination is therefore needed. Objectives: * To estimate the influenza- and RSV-associated mortality, hospitalisations and primary care burden in order to support national vaccination policies. * To evaluate the effects of influenza vaccination with or without pneumococcal conjugate vaccination on RTI in preschool children. Methods: * Using data from death registries, hospital admissions, primary care consultations, and virus surveillance during 1997-2003 in the Netherlands, the annual average influenza- and RSV-associated excesses of mortality, hospitalisations, and primary care consultations were estimated using rate difference methods. * The effects of influenza vaccination with or without pneumococcal conjugate vaccination were assessed in a randomised double-blind controlled trial among 579 children aged 18-72 months with a prior history of physician-diagnosed RTI (the ‘PRIMAKid’-trial). Results and conclusions: * In young children the highest influenza-associated excesses of hospitalisations and primary visits were observed. However, information about the effects of influenza vaccination among young children is lacking and further research should first address this prior to consideration to include this group in the recommendations for influenza vaccinations. In adults younger than 65 years of age, influenza-associated hospitalisations and primary care visits roughly increased with age, with the highest excess in the 60-64-year-olds; also influenza-associated mortality was highest in this age group. * RSV-associated hospitalisation rates were highest for the youngest children, although the excess was also substantial in 50-64-year-olds with high-risk conditions and the elderly. In elderly persons, RSV-active periods were associated with excess mortality. * The PRIMAKid-trial demonstrated that influenza vaccination with or without pneumococcal conjugate vaccination reduced confirmed influenza by about 50% and AOM episodes by 57 to 71% during influenza season. This means that between 20 and 25 children are required to be vaccinated in order to prevent one influenza episode; for AOM this number is 19-22 during the influenza season. The effects on febrile RTI in general appeared less during influenza seasons and effects of vaccinations were absent outside the influenza seasons.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Von Willebrand Factor : Function and cellular adhesion'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Von Willebrand factor (VWF) is a plasma protein that circulates as an array of multimerized subunits. For decades, VWF has been known as a carrier for FVIII and a key element for the recruitment of platelets to the injured vessel wall, particularly under conditions of rapid blood flow. More recently, it has become apparent that VWF is doing more than just that. The aim of my study was to obtain more insight into the in vivo and in vitro behavior of VWF, with regard to its classical haemostatic function as well as its potential contribution to non-haemostasis related processes. In case of vascular injury, subendothelial matrix becomes exposed to the circulation. VWF bound to collagen can recruit platelets interacting with their receptor GPIbα. Platelets decelerate, interact with the matrix and become activated. VWF can subsequently bind to the integrin αIIbβ3, participating in platelet aggregation. The lack of information on the in vivo role of VWF-collagen and VWF-αIIbβ3, interactions lead us to develop a model allowing the transient expression of VWF in VWF-deficient mice by the hydrodynamic delivery of murine VWF cDNA. We showed that the expression of wild-type murine VWF could reverse the bleeding phenotype in VWF-deficient mice whereas GPIbα-binding mutant could not. Surprisingly, expression of collagen-binding or αIIbβ3-binding mutants resulted in a full correction of the bleeding. VWF appeared to be also directly involved in non-heamostatic processes such as metastasis. In vitro, VWF is able to promote adhesion of tumor cells via its RGD sequence. Surprisingly, VWF-deficient mice injected with tumor cells developed more metastases than wild-type mice. The absence of VWF seemed to increase tumor cells survival in the lungs. The potential implication of VWF in inflammation was also investigated. We showed that leukocytes (PMNs and monocytes) were able to adhere to VWF under both static and flow conditions. VWF provides binding sites for leukocyte receptors involved in rolling (P-selectin glycoprotein ligand (PSGL)-1) and stable adhesion (β2-integrins). Apart from participating in leukocyte recruitment, these interactions could potentially be involved in regulation of survival/apoptosis of neutrophils, or VWF clearance. Since PSGL1 and GpIbα share structural resemblance and common ligands such as VWF, we considered the possibility that other GpIbα ligands are able to bind PSGL1 as well. We investigated the potential interaction between PSGL1 and the recently identified GPIbα  ligand dimeric β2-glycoprotein I (β2GPI). β2GPI is a major target for auto-antibodies in the Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS). These antibodies can induce dimerization of β2GPI, which can consequently bind to platelets. PSGL1 bound selectively to the dimeric form of β2GPI in a Zn2+-dependant manner. Neutrophils adhered to dimeric β2GPI under both static and flow conditions. Aside from PSGL1, members of the LDL-Receptor family also participate in this adhesion. Interaction between dimeric β2GPI and neutrophils may contribute to the thrombotic tendency found in APS patients. In conclusion, this study showed that VWF is also involved in non-haemostatic processes such as metastasis and inflammation; illustrating the fact that one component originally identified as part of one biological system may fulfill several tasks.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Drug carrier systems can be used to overcome problems related to the proper formulation of a promising drug candidate, or to improve its efficacy and safety in vivo. In particular self-assembled nanosized polymeric vesicles and micelles are interesting for the (targeted) delivery of hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs, respectively. Their small size and hydrophilic surface are attractive features to achieve long circulatory behaviour after intravenous admininstration, enabling extravasation and accumulation at tumour sites. Other favourable characteristics of these systems are their ease of preparation and their tailorability, as the use of (semi-)synthetic polymers offers the possibility to modulate the carriers properties and to control the release of the loaded drug. In this thesis the self-assembling properties of well-defined low molecular weight poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-b-oligoesters were studied in detail, and their suitability to design novel nanosized drug carriers was evaluated. It was demonstrated that mPEG-b-oligo(L-lactate)s (OLA) with monodisperse hydrophobic blocks formed nanoparticles with a hydrodynamic radius of 130-300 nm, whereas polydisperse mPEG-b-OLAs formed large aggregates. Further characterisation of the nanoparticles by static light scattering (SLS) indicated that they were highly hydrated nanoaggregates. When mPEG-b-OLAs are applied for the solubilisation of therapeutic proteins and drugs for intravenous administration, their relatively high critical aggregation concentration (CAC) necessitates the use of high amounts of mPEG-b-OLA, and systems with a lower CAC would be more attractive. Therefore the self-assembly of block oligomers with a more hydrophobic oligoester, mPEG-b-oligo(epsilon-caprolactone) (OCL), was investigated, which had much lower CACs than the mPEG-b-OLAs. Moreover, in water mPEG-b-OCL formed small and almost monodisperse oligomeric micelles with a hydrodynamic diameter of 8-15 nm, which may have attractive properties for drug delivery applications in terms of biodistribution and tumour penetration. Importantly, it was found that modification of the OCL block with an aromatic end group substantially improved the physical stability of these micelles, by an extensive reduction of the CAC and by improving their temperature sensitivity profile. Degradation studies revealed an estimated half-life of the hydrolytic cleavage of the ester bonds in these mPEG-b-OCL based micelles at physiological pH and temperature of several years. However, the presence of lipase accelerated the degradation and destabilisation of the mPEG-b-OCL micelles to half-lives of a few days to hours, indicating that degradation induced destabilisation and subsequent drug release from these mPEG-b-OCL micelles is feasible by the action of enzymes in vivo. The loading of these micelles with paclitaxel and docetaxel was evaluated, demonstrating that the presence of an aromatic end group is essential for the formation stable small-sized mPEG-b-OCL micelles loaded with 10% (w/w) of taxane, and their integrity of the was not affected by the presence of albumin. Their cytotoxic effect on C26 cells was comparable to that of the commercial formulations Taxol and Taxotere whereas the empty micelles, in contrast to Cremophor EL, were not toxic in the concentration range tested. In conclusion, the PEG-b-oligoesters studied in this thesis represent an interesting class of amphiphilic molecules, which possess attractive properties for pharmaceutical applications.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Severe fatigue in adolescents : psychological, neuro-endocrine, and immunological characteristics'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Fatigue is a common complaint among adolescents. In a pilot study, we observed 8% of healthy adolescents to report fatigue severity which was comparable to fatigue severity reported by chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) patients. This observation led to an extensive investigation on psychological, neuro-endocrine, and immunological characteristics of severe fatigued in adolescents. In an epidemiological study, we investigated the prevalence of severe fatigue, its comorbidities and the role of life style. In a sample of 3454 high school students, 20.5% of girls and 6.5% of boys reported severe fatigue on a standardized questionnaire. Despite this female preponderance, in both genders fatigue was strongly related to depression, anxiety and CFS-related symptoms, such as pain, unrefreshing sleep, and cognitive problems. In a longitudinal study among girls, we revealed that the onset and persistence of fatigue was predicted by emotional problems. In addition, life style played a minor role in fatigue. Reduced physical activity and night rest were related to fatigue as well. To investigate whether fatigue was related to physiological disturbances, we selected a subgroup of severely fatigued and non-fatigued female participants and tested them on three occasions during one year. We compared these two groups on functions of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis and the immune system since previous research showed dysfunctions in these systems in CFS patients. Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR), which is a commonly used read out of adrenal functioning, did not differ between the fatigued and non-fatigued group, neither did results on the low-dose dexamethasone (DEX) suppression test, which tests the negative feedback function of the HPA-axis. Basal cortisol measured in plasma, on the other hand, was higher in fatigued participants than in non-fatigued girls. Groups did not differ in mitogen-induced cytokine production and T-cell proliferation. Yet, a subgroup of fatigued girls with high levels of emotional comorbidity had a skewing in cytokine production towards an anti-inflammatory milieu. Also, a small sample of adolescent CFS patients produced relatively more anti-inflammatory cytokines. Receptor sensitivity of T-cells and monocytes to DEX did not differ between fatigued and non-fatigued participants, suggesting no dysfunctions of the immune system and the interactions between the immune system and the HPA-axis. However, also in these analyses we discovered deviations in a subgroup of fatigued participants. T-cell receptor sensitivity to DEX was reduced in participants with persistent fatigue. All immune functions measured in our studies showed seasonal variation, with systematically different values in spring compared to autumn. Nevertheless, relatively to the other participants of the group, values of each individual were fairly stable. We conclude that, the involvement of emotional problems in the onset and persistence of fatigue suggests that both preventive and therapeutic strategies with respect to fatigue treatment in adolescents should concentrate on emotional well being. Moreover, adolescents at risk should be stimulated to spend more time on physical activities and to sleep longer. Although fatigue is frequently reported, neuro-endocrine and immunological functions are not always affected. It would be interesting to investigate whether the subgroups of participants with physiological deviations have a higher risk to develop fatigue-related illnesses in the future.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The primary function of the immune system is to protect the body against invading pathogens. However, the mechanisms it employs to kill pathogens can also kill cells of the body. To prevent this all immune cells express inhibitory receptors. These receptors can function by preventing unnecessary activation or terminating immune reactions when the causative agent is removed. Many inhibitory immune receptors relay their inhibitory signal into the cell via inhibitory motifs (ITIMs). When the inhibitory receptor is bound by its ligand the tyrosine residues in the ITIM are phosphorylated and recruit phosphatases. These phosphatases can dephosphorylate activating molecules, thereby inhibiting cellular activation. In this thesis, we investigate the mechanism of action of two different inhibitory immune receptors: LAIR-1 and CD200R. LAIR-1 is an inhibitory receptor expressed on almost all immune cells that contains two ITIMs in its intracellular domain. LAIR-1 is known to recruit phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2 after phosphorylation. However, here we report that LAIR-1 has phosphatase-independent activity and show that the C-terminal Src family kinase Csk interacts with LAIR-1 and is a potential mediator of its inhibitory function. CD200R is an atypical inhibitory immune receptor that does not contain ITIMs, but does contain three single tyrosines in its intracellular domain. We report that CD200R only has full inhibitory capacity when all three intracellular tyrosines are present. In addition, we found association of Dok-1 and Shc to CD200R using a yeast tri hybrid system. Thus, we conclude that not all immune inhibition is relayed by inhibitory receptors signalling through ITIMs and phosphatases. CD200R is known to be an important inhibitor of myeloid cell function. Mice deficient for the ligand of CD200R, CD200, have enhanced activation of the myeloid cells expressing CD200R and show increased susceptibility to the induction of auto-immune diseases, due to reduced inhibition. Dok-1 and Dok-2 both are reported to associate to CD200R. Since Dok-1/Dok-2 double knockout mice develop myeloid leukaemia, we investigated whether CD200R signalling is involved in leukaemia development. We report that CD200-/- mice have normal numbers of myeloid progenitor and stem cells and that these cells have normal proliferative capacity. In addition, CD200-/- mice do not develop leukaemia even at old age. Thus, we conclude that CD200R signalling is not involved in leukaemia development in Dok-1/Dok-2 double knockout mice. Previously, CD200R expression was mainly reported on myeloid cells. However, here we demonstrate that CD200R is also differentially expressed on subsets of both human and mouse T and B lymphocytes. To investigate the role of CD200R signalling in the immune response against a virus, we infected CD200-/- mice with influenza. Surprisingly, CD200-/- mice develop severe disease upon influenza infection, whereas control wild type mice develop only mild symptoms. After depletion of almost all CD4+ and CD8+ T cells before influenza infection, CD200-/- mice did not develop severe disease, indicating T cells may play a role in the development of the severe disease of CD200-/- mice after influenza infection. These data indicate that CD200 is an important host factor in the determination of the outcome of influenza infections.'],\n",

       "  'Description': [\"Modification of proteins with metal complexes is a promising and a relatively new field which conceals many challenges and potential applications. The field is a balance of contributions from the biological (protein engineering, bioconjugation) and chemical sciences (organic, inorganic and organometallic chemistry) and requires a multidisciplinary approach. Amongst the many prominent reasons to develop protein-metal complex hybrid materials are their potential use as artificial metalloenzymes with high performance as stereoselective non-enzymatic catalysts, as a tool for the isomorphous replacement method in X-ray structure determination, as diagnostic biosensors, as well as for novel pharmaceutical and medical treatments. The introduction of organometallic complexes into proteins has been challenged in numerous cases and has shown to be a promising extension to the existing hybrid systems. A crucial difference of organometallic complexes, as compared with other inorganic complexes, is the presence of a covalent metal-carbon bond which prevents facile metal dissociation from the protein-metal complex hybrid materials. One of the challenges in this field lies in the generation of organometallic complexes that are 'biocompatible', i.e. complexes that are stable under physiological conditions. The main objective of the work described in this thesis has been the development of a versatile and straightforward method to covalently and irreversibly incorporate organometallic complexes into a protein structure in a single site-directed manner. In this work, the versatile organometallic ECE-pincer metal complex system was chosen as the metal containing component of the protein-metal complex hybrid. As metal complex anchoring functionality the p-nitrophenyl phosphonate ester group have been selected as these have shown to be highly potent and irreversible inhibitors of the large family of serine hydrolases. Cutinase from Fusarium solani pisi was selected as model enzyme to demonstrate the versatility of the developed approach. The general concept of our molecular design is a pincer metal complex covalently connected through a carbon-phosphorous bond to the phosphonate active ester. The first part of this thesis is focused on the design and synthesis of these complexes as well as on the subsequent reactivity of such compounds with cutinase. In the second part several aspects of ECE-pincer metal complexes are described that are of importance when such complexes are applied in protein modification strategies. This entails a study of the conformational behavior of SCS-pincer metal complexes in solution and solid state, as well as interesting structural features and behavior in solution of highly water-soluble pincer metal complexes having a sulfate moiety as ligand or counterion.\"],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Copper is an essential element for living organisms, yet it is very toxic when present in amounts exceeding cellular needs. Delicate mechanisms have evolved to ensure proper copper homeostasis is maintained for the organism, as well as at a cellular level, and perturbations in these mechanisms give rise to several severe diseases of copper homeostasis. However, the exact mechanisms through which such disorders of copper homeostasis develop are not completely understood. Therefore, the work in this thesis entitled \"Novel insights in the molecular pathogenesis of human copper homeostasis disorders through studies of protein-protein interactions\" aims to dissect the molecular pathogenesis of human copper homeostasis disorders. Copper deficiency, as caused by mutations in ATP7A in Menkes disease, manifests with neurological degeneration, growth defects and several other symptoms that directly relate to dysfunction of copper-dependent enzymes. Copper overload is observed in several different disorders in man. Wilson disease, for example, is caused by mutations in ATP7B and manifests with copper accumulation in the liver and brain, resulting in extensive hepatic and neurological defects. Other copper overload disorders comprise Indian childhood cirrhosis (ICC), endemic infantile Tyrolean cirrhosis (ETIC) and idiopathic copper toxicosis (ICT), caused by both excessive copper intake and an uncharacterized genetic predisposition. Recently, we identified COMMD1 as a novel protein involved in copper homeostasis; a deletion in COMMD1 underlies the development of copper toxicosis in Bedlington terriers, a disorder that shares pathophysiological features with Wilson disease, ICC, ETIC, and ICT. The experimental work in this thesis aimed to functionally characterize COMMD1 through the study of protein-protein interactions. Identifying novel interacting partners was expected to result in increased understanding of the mechanism through which COMMD1 exerts its function in copper homeostasis, and lead to identification of novel candidate genes for ICC, ETIC and ICT. Our studies resulted in the identification of the previously uncharacterized protein COMMD6 as interacting partner of COMMD1. This work has contributed to the identification and characterization of the COMMD protein family, a family consisting of nine human homologues of COMMD1. A number of COMMD proteins, including COMMD1, interact with the copper transporting ATPases ATP7A and/or ATP7B, suggesting that the COMMD protein family plays a role in copper homeostasis. Three of these COMMD proteins interact with ATP7B, implicating that they function in the hepatic copper excretion pathways. The genes encoding these COMMD proteins were investigated as candidate genes for ICC, ETIC, and ICT, revealing several single nucleotide polymorphisms that could be involved in the pathogenesis of these disorders. In addition, we observed a deregulation of the interaction between COMMD1 and ATP7B resulting from Wilson disease causing mutations in ATP7B, implicating COMMD1 in the molecular pathogenesis of Wilson disease. Further characterization of these mutations in ATP7B, resulted in our observation that COMMD1 exerts its role in ATP7B-mediated hepatic copper excretion by facilitating the degradation of ATP7B. Taken together, the research described in this thesis implicates COMMD proteins as a novel protein family in the regulation of copper transport pathways, and the pathogenesis of human copper homeostasis disorders.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Allergen specific immunotherapy: The future cure for allergic asthma. Mechanisms and improvement in a mouse model'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Allergic asthma is a disease characterized by persistent allergen-driven airway inflammation, remodeling and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR). CD4+ T-cells, in particular T-helper type 2 (Th2) cells, play a critical role in orchestrating the disease process through the release of cytokines like IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13. Allergen-specific immunotherapy (IT) is currently the only disease-modifying treatment with long-term suppression of allergen-induced complaints. However, although IT is effective in allergic rhinitis and insect venom allergy, in allergic asthma it seldom results in complete alleviation of symptoms, and bears the risk of inducting severe systemic reactions. There is a strong need to improve IT, however, the mechanism of action is still incompletely understood. Previously we developed a mouse model of IT for allergic asthma which inhibits development of AHR and eosinophilic airway inflammation associated with suppression of Th2-type cytokines. Moreover, we have shown that IT induces IL-10 dependent long-lasting immune tolerance, pointing to a role for T-regulatory type 1 (Tr1) cells. In this thesis, the immunoregulatory mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of IT were further investigated in an ovalbumin (OVA)-induced mouse model of allergic asthma with the ultimate aim to improve its treatment efficacy. We addressed the following questions: • Do IgG Fcgamma receptors play a role in tolerance induction by IT (chapter 2)? • Is the tryptophan-catabolizing enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, (IDO) expressed in dendritic cells, involved in immune suppression and/or tolerance induction by IT (chapter 3)? • Does the induction of immune tolerance by IT require the suppressive activity of natural regulatory T (nTreg) cells (chapter 4)? • Does the inhibition of NF-kappa B by the active form of vitamin D3, 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, potentiate the suppressive effects of IT?, and are the immunoregulatory cytokines IL-10 and TGF-beta involved in the effector phase (chapter 5)? Using Fcgamma RI & III and Fcgamma RIIB deficient mice, it is clearly demonstrated that Fcgamma receptors have no role in the effects of IT on asthma manifestations in this mouse model. Interestingly, our findings indicate that nTreg cells partially contribute to the induction of tolerance by IT. Functional inactivation of these nTreg cells through GITR activation or blockade of CTLA-4 reduces the efficacy of IT, in particular the suppression of AHR. Moreover, we show that inhibition of IDO by treatment with the inhibitor 1-methyl-tryptophan, reverses the suppressive effects of IT on AHR, bronchoalveolar lavage eosinophilia and Th2 cytokine levels. In addition, the tryptophan metabolites generated via IDO, kynurenine, 3-hydroxy-kynurenine and xanthurenic acid, but not tryptophan depletion, are involved in the induction of tolerance by IT. Interestingly, nTreg cells can trigger the induction of IDO in dendritic cells by engagement of B7 through CTLA-4 and also by GITR:GITRL interaction. Taken together, our data suggest that tolerance induction by IT is partially mediated by a nTreg-IDO pathway leading to the generation of adaptive Treg cells that suppress Th2 cell activation and development allergen-induced asthma manifestations. In order to improve IT, we examined whether the induction of IL-10 and/or TGF-beta producing adaptive Treg cells could be potentiated by suppression of dendritic cell maturation using 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. It is shown that coadministration of the active form of vitamin D3 with IT augments the suppressive effects on Th2-driven asthma manifestations when compared to IT alone. Moreover, these suppressive effects are reversed by blocking of the regulatory cytokines IL-10 and TGF-beta. These findings have increased our knowledge of the mechanisms of action of IT and may be translated to IT in allergic and asthmatic patients and ultimately guide the design of novel strategies to improve the efficacy of IT.'],\n",

       "  'Description': [\"Summary of the thesis “Harvesting the weak angular reflections from the fundus of the human eye” by Jan van de Kraats University Medical Centre Utrecht. Defended October 16, 2007. This thesis is on the modeling of the optical reflection of the human fovea, and on the three instruments build for retrieving the data. Instrument one, the densitometer, measured reflected light from a small spot on the retina at 14 wavelengths. Not only in a state with the visual pigments bleached, but even in the dark adapted state. An optical model was derived to explain the data in terms of absorbers (lens, macular pigment, blood and melanin) and reflectors in the eye (mainly cones and choroid). Important messages were that the origin of the directional reflection was at the cone discs, and that the layers posterior to the receptors show inherent non-directionality. A second instrument was developed, the Profile Spectrometer. This for speeding up the measurement time, important in working with patients. A spot of white light illuminated the retina. Reflected light fills the whole pupil of the eye, but only the light passing through a (virtual) slit from an imaging spectrometer was used. In one second a two dimensional image from a CCD detector could be gathered, incorporating both the detailed spectral and directional reflection information from the retina. A new model explaining simultaneously the directional and the non-directional part of the foveal reflection was developed. In this model the reflection from the cones shows a one over wavelength squared behavior. A new insight was that light losses by scattering were not lost for the reflection from the layers posterior to the receptors. Macular pigment is present in the central region of the retina. It benefits visual performance, and keeps the retina healthy by scavenging free radicals. To measure its optical density, a third instrument, the Macular Pigment Spectrometer was built. In order to keep it low cost, an external fiber optic spectrometer was applied. Thanks to the small illumination and detection pupil of the instrument, it made measurements in eyes with undilated pupil possible. In order to gain knowledge of the optical transmission spectra of the eye media as a function of age, an extensive literature investigation was performed. Five spectral templates were derived that proved sufficient and necessary to describe all literature data in great detail. One formula was derived to calculate the transmission of the mean human media for every wavelength, at any age. With these new data the optimal spectral shape of the filter in intraocular lenses (implanted after cataract surgery) was derived. Such spectral filtering prevents the harmful short wavelengths from reaching the retina. At the same time, the perception of this violet and blue light asks for minimal attenuation. We measured several types of existing intraocular lenses and calculated the protection and perception values. It appeared that most older types of lenses, and even one claimed as a modern type, transmitted more dangerous UV radiation than a young human lens. With the new concept of 'virtual age' for the filter characteristics, selection of lenses should become much easier.\"],\n",

       "  'Description': ['This prospective randomized controlled trial evaluated a theory-driven group-based self-management course for patients with screen-detected type 2 diabetes. 227 patients receiving either intensive pharmacological or usual-care treatment since diagnosis (3-33 months previously) agreed to participate and were subsequently randomized to a control or intervention condition (3-month, nurse-lead, self-management course). Based on self-regulation theory and proactive coping, the course incorporated elements of anticipation, goal-setting and planning in a proactive 5-step plan to help patients translate their good intentions into sustained self-management behaviors. A 2x2 factorial design evaluated the behavioral intervention (self-management course versus control) nested within the medical treatment (intensive versus usual-care) and included a baseline psychological assessment, a preliminary assessment of psychological outcomes at 3-months, and changes in self-management behaviors and cardiovascular outcomes (BMI, blood pressure, Hba1c and lipid profiles) from 0-12 months. At baseline, most patients experienced little emotional distress but also generally underestimated their condition and reported low self-management behavior. At 3-months, course completers evaluated the course and the 5-step plan very positively and showed significant improvements in their proactive coping, self-efficacy and goal-attainment. 12-month evaluations revealed that the intervention group experienced significant and sustained improvements in their self-management behaviors, BMI (-0.77 kg/m2) and systolic blood pressure (-6.2 mmHg). In all aspects, the self-management course was effective independent of medical treatment; however, those patients receiving both intensive pharmacological treatment and the course showed greatest reduction in their cardiovascular risk, suggesting that a combination of medical and behavioral treatments may be particularly effective in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Intraesophageal impedance monitoring: clinical studies'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Electrical impedance (Z) between two electrodes is the ratio between applied voltage (U) and resulting current (I). In electrical impedance monitoring the resistance to electrical flow in an alternating current circuit is measured. Multichannel esophageal monitoring can be measured by using an intraluminal catheter with multiple, closely spaced pairs of metal rings. Changes in temporal-spatial patterns in impedance are identified at various levels within the esophagus, allowing differentiation between antegrade (swallow) and retrograde (reflux) bolus movement. Esophageal impedance monitoring can be used to assess the clearance of a swallowed bolus (esophageal transit) and to detect gastro-esophageal reflux independent of its acidity. In the first part of the thesis, the value of intraesophageal impedance monitoring as a tool to assess esophageal transit was studied in normal subjects, patients with non-obstructive dysphagia and achalasia patients. In the second part, gastro-esophageal reflux patterns was studied using impedance monitoring in patients with functional dyspepsia, patients with gastro-esophageal reflux disease treated with endoscopic gastroplication as well as in patients with erosive esophagitis and non-erosive reflux disease. Using combined impedance and perfusion manometry, normal esophageal bolus clearance was defined as complete clearance of at least 70% of liquid boluses and at least 60% of viscous boluses. Impedance recording identifies esophageal function abnormalities in non-obstructive dysphagia patients with normal manometry, ineffective esophageal motility and diffuse esophageal spasm. The impedance technique seems to be less suitable for the most severe end of the dysphagia spectrum like achalasia. In achalasia patients, low-baseline impedance levels and air entrapment in the proximal esophagus limit the value of intraluminal impedance monitoring as a test of esophageal emptying. Patients with functional dyspepsia swallow air more frequently than controls and this abnormality is associated with an increased incidence of non-acid gaseous gastro-esophageal reflux. Impedance monitoring can identify the specific effect of endoscopic gastroplication on the different types of reflux episodes with regard to gas-liquid composition and pH, as well as on volume clearance and the proximal extent of the refluxate. Whereas patients with erosive esophagitis have more acid reflux episodes in the supine position than patients with non-erosive reflux disease, both groups have similar non-acid reflux patterns.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Effect of local IL-2 application on bovine cancer In tropical countries there is an increased prevalence of two important cancers in cattle: Bovine Ocular Squamous Cell Carcinoma (BOSCC) and Bovine Vulval Papilloma Carcinoma Complex (BVPCC). Both cancers are associated with increased annual hours of sunshine, increased altitude and decreased latitude. These cancers occur in unpigmented skin where there is no or limited hair; skin pigment and hair appear to protect against cancer induction by sunshine. These cancers occur in about 10 percent of cattle in tropical countries but only rarely in moderate climates. The veterinarian Rachel Stewart has treated both types of cancer with peritumoral or intratumoral Interleukin-2 (IL-2) injections in Zimbabwe. This locally injected IL-2 induces leakage of fluid from local capillaries, causing oedema. This leads to enhanced tissue pressure that inhibits blood flow in the capillaries. As a consequence cancer cells die. The necrotic tumour material is phagocytosed by white blood cells. This leads to antigen presentation and consequently tumour immunity. This causes further tumor cell killing. Treatment of BOSCC with local IL-2 application leads to gradual tumor regression. After about 6-9 months Complete Regression is obtained in up to 69% of the cases. Treatment of BVPCC leads to stable disease in up to 73% of the cases. It is understandable that the BOSCC is more susceptible to IL-2 as there are more blood capillaries in BOSCC than in BVPCC. In addition up to 14% of BOSCC will be eliminated by the animals’ own immune response without treatment whereas no spontaneous regression is seen with BVPCC. These results are economically important as cows will live longer without a tumour; produce more calves and more milk during their extended life time. In addition slaughter carcasses will have more value if there is no tumour evident. The treatment is easy and can be performed at the farms. The treatment is cheap as only small quantities of IL-2 are needed.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Carotid artery revascularization. Surgical and endovascular developments. Stroke is among the most disabling chronic diseases and the third major cause of death in the Western world. In the Netherlands around 12 per 1000 inhabitants suffers a stroke, and in 2005 over 10.000 people died as a result of stroke representing 7.6% of all deaths. In 10-20% of patients stroke is heralded by transient cerebral deficit. These harbingers of stroke allow a certain amount of time to search for the cause of the symptoms and, when stenosis of the corresponding carotid artery is demonstrated, to perform carotid endarterectomy (CEA) as the best treatment in patients with ≥ 70 % diameter artery reduction. Although being one of the most scrutinised areas of medicine, the management of carotid artery disease maintains an unparalleled and enduringly reputation for controversy. The paradox remains that the very operation undertaken to prevent stroke (in the long-term) is associated with a small, but important risk of stroke in the peri-operative period (3-7%). It therefore remains essential that the benefits of surgery in stroke prevention are weighed against the immediate risk of death or stroke, and the incidence of restenosis. The fate of the treated carotid artery is the central theme connecting the chapters in this thesis, focusing both on postprocedural outcome as well as on durability and the incidence of restenosis. Elucidating the underlying mechanism of perioperative stroke and the role of intraoperative monitoring, it appeared that strokes from CEA (3.3%) mainly developed in the postoperative phase after a symptom free interval. Thromboembolism with occlusion of the operated artery showed most important in the pathogenesis. Patients destined to suffer an early postoperative stroke have a 1- to 2- hour period of increasing embolization before cerebral deficit becomes apparent. We studied the effect of 3 different antiplatelet regimens on the rate of postoperative embolization following CEA, but we did not find a significant relationship. For post-endarterectomy restenosis both repeat CEA and carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) could be performed with a low incidence of periprocedural complications with durable stroke protection. However, following CAS the rate of in-stent restenosis was high. An additional disadvantage of CAS might be the covering of the external carotid artery (ECA) orifice. Significant progression of ≥ 50% stenosis in the ipsilateral ECA occurred after CAS. Progression of ECA disease however did not lead to occlusion during follow up. Our experience with the surgical managment of in-stent restenosis was described in 4 consecutive patients who underwent successful standard CEA with removal of the stent. The optimal treatment of in-stent restenosis remains to be defined, but CEA with stent removal appears to be feasible. An animal experiment was conducted to evaluate carotid diameter and velocity changes due to stent placement. Alterations were stent type dependent, and did not justify a general approach to new velocity criteria indiscriminately applied to all stents. The final chapter summarizes the knowledge about the quality of the current revascularization techniques and debates how outcomes can be optimised in the future.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Pressure ulcers (PU), also called bedsores or decubitus, present a significant problem in healthcare. This thesis addresses some aspects of the aetiology of PU. The possible benefit of interventions with nutrional supplementation and the use of a risk assessment tool are evaluated. The role of reactive oxygen species in the pathogenesis of pressure ulcer coupled with possible therapeutical interventions with antioxidant drugs, is the main topic of this thesis. Chapter 2 describes the results of a clinical-pathological study of skin samples in patients with incontinence and moisture lesions. Based on the results it can be concluded that the influence of urine is not sufficient to cause skin loss. Shearing forces are an essential etiologic factor in moisture lesions. The guidelines on prevention and treatment of skin lesions in incontinent patients should be based on three main interventions: managing the incontinence problem, adequate skin care and diminishing tissue loading. In chapter 3 we evaluated the sensitivity of a risk assessment tool. It was not possible to identify patients at risk for PU solely on the basis of the use of a risk assessment tool. Identification of a patient at risk, should be based on the combination of 1) a pressure ulcer risk assessment tool 2) the clinical judgement 3) the prognosis of the underlying disease 4) the discomfort of the patient 5) inspection and palpation of the threatened area. In chapter 4 we studied the effect of nutritional supplementation on the prevention of the development of PU. Patients received after the surgical procedure a high-protein supplementation, enriched with antioxidants or placebo supplement. We found no significant positive effect of drink foods. Before advocating the use of extra nutrional supplements in PU prevention, further research is required. This does not imply that no attention has to be given to the nutritional state of the patient. However, intervention with drink foods especially can interfere with the normal daily intake, are expensive and do not integrate physical care with measures to improve quality of life. In chapter 5 we studied the effects of pressure in an animal model. After the application of pressure we investigated the damage in muscle, subcutis and cutis. Our studies showed that reperfusion injury plays an important role in the pathophysiology of PU. We have also shown that it is possible to reduce the extent of the tissue damage in PU by means of antioxidants in an animal model. In chapter 6A we present the findings of a systematic survey of the literature about the effects of topical application of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) on the skin as an anti-inflammatory agent. Chapter 6B describes the results of a randomised double-blinded study, performed to assess the effects of massage with or without DMSO cream. We demonstrated a detrimental effect on the occurrence of PU on the heels in humans with a locally applied antioxidant. More animal and human studies are required to establish the safety and effectiveness of antioxidantal therapy.'],\n",

Modulation of natural defence mechanisms by dietary additives may be one way to improve intestinal health and food safety. In mammals, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) play an important role in the host defence of skin and mucosal surfaces. We sought for novel members of known antimicrobial peptide families using in silico analysis and discovered 7 unknown chicken beta-defensins (AvBDs) and one chicken cathelicidin (CMAP27). High, breed-independent AvBD9 mRNA expression was found in crop and esophagus tissue. Promoter analysis of the AvBD9 gene as well as AvBD9 mRNA expression variability observed in the crop tissue of young animals, suggested an inducible nature of the AvBD9 gene. CMAP27 mRNA was highly and predominantly expressed in myeloid and lymphoid tissues. Abundant CMAP27 protein was found in heterophilic granulocytes, but not in other peripheral blood cells. Considerable infiltration of CMAP27 containing heterophils was observed in the jejunum of Salmonella-challenged 4 day-old chicken broilers at 8 and 48 hours post infection as compared to non-infected animals; however, CMAP27 expression was not induced in intestinal epithelial cells. Synthetic AvBD9 and CMAP27 peptides showed potent broad spectrum antimicrobial activity against bacteria and fungi. Their potent antimicrobial properties and possible upregulation and mobilisation at mucosal interfaces render these peptides prime candidates to be investigated in studies addressing AMP modulation by dietary modulation.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['This thesis focuses on the synthesis of functionalized polyesters, poly(α-hydroxy) acids in particular, with increased hydrophilicity as materials for biomedical and pharmaceutical applications. For this purpose, a general synthesis route to functionalized dilactones was designed and optimized. This route made the synthesis of large amounts of functionalized dilactones possible. The obtained dilactones were polymerized (homo- or copolymerized) via ROP to obtain the corresponding functionalized polyesters. Upon deprotection of these polymers, hydroxyl functionalized polyesters were obtained. The obtained polymers are structurally analogous to established polyesters such as PLGA and PLLA. The monomers that were used consisted of either lactic acid or glycolic acid which are endogenous compounds, and (S)-3-(benzyloxy)-2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is a derivative of serine. Upon deprotection of the latter compound glyceric acid is formed. Glyceric acid can be metabolized in the human body via the glycolytic pathway. It is therefore expected that the degradation products of the polymers used in this study will have a low or absent toxicity. Other polymers that were synthesized contained allyl functional groups. These were oxidized via two different pathways; dihydroxylation and epoxidation. The dihydroxylation gave materials that degraded very rapidly and were therefore not further investigated. The epoxidation, however, gave fully epoxidated polymers which can be used for further functionalization.'],\n",

       "  'Description': [\"Small RNAs are important transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. Many classes of small RNAs have been discovered, each carrying out specialized functions. siRNAs and miRNAs are best studies. siRNAs function in the process of RNAi and are thought to defend the genome against molecular parasites. They have become widely used tools in biomedical research. miRNAs are abundant and conserved; they form a class of endogenous small RNAs that fine-tunes gene expression. Most, if not all, small RNAs function through association with members of the Argonaute protein family. This thesis focuses on the function of small RNAs and Argonaute proteins in RNAi and the miRNA pathway. To understand the role of miRNAs in development, we aimed to catalogue the zebrafish miRNAs and analyze their expression. By sequencing miRNA libraries from 5-day-old zebrafish larvae and adult zebrafish brain, we found 139 known and 66 new miRNAs. We analyzed the temporal and spatial expression patterns of 67 miRNAs by whole mount in situ hybridization and northern blot analysis. Most miRNAs are expressed during later stages of development, often in a tissue specific manner. Most newly discovered miRNAs have low expression levels and are less conserved in other vertebrate species. We also analyzed the connection between the miRNAs and Argonaute proteins in C. elegans. The Argonaute proteins required for the miRNA pathway are ALG-1 and ALG-2. We used massively parallel sequencing to analyze the spectrum of small RNAs associated with ALG-1. We found that this protein almost exclusively binds to miRNAs. In addition to 84 known miRNAs, we found ten novel miRNAs. RNAi is an amplified process in C. elegans. In the amplification step, RNA-directed RNA polymerases (RdRPs) produce secondary siRNAs, which we cloned from transgenic lines expressing a single primary siRNA. We found that RdRPs perform unprimed RNA synthesis to generate secondary siRNAs, and that mRNAs which are not cleaved by the primary siRNA-Argonaute complex can be used as substrates. Secondary siRNAs are only of antisense polarity, carry 5' di- or triphosphates, and are only in the minority associated with RDE-1, the primary siRNA-binding Argonaute protein. Therefore, secondary siRNAs represent a distinct class of small RNAs. siRNAs and miRNAs are both processed from dsRNA-precursors by the dsRNase DCR-1. We investigated how RNAi and the miRNA pathway are mechanistically separated. We showed that precursors of small RNAs contain structural features that direct the small RNAs into the RNAi or the miRNA pathway. Small RNAs expressed from hairpin precursors with a fully matching stem are recognized as siRNAs and bound by RDE-1. A one- to three-nucleotide mismatch at various positions in the stem of the precursor directs the small RNAs into the miRNA pathway, as these small RNAs are in majority bound to ALG-1. The Argonaute proteins to which the small RNAs are bound determine the silencing mode, and no functional overlap between RDE-1 and ALG-1 was detected. We also provide evidence that RNAi is slicer-independent in C. elegans and analyze RDE-1-associated small RNAs as an approach to the endogenous role of RNAi.\"],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Dietary fat type, meat quality and fatty acid metabolism in swine'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['This thesis focuses on the replacement of animal fat by vegetable oil in the diet for growing-finishing pigs. Generally, but not exclusively, fats of animal origin contain higher proportions of saturated fatty acids (SFA) than vegetable oils that are commonly rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). There is concern among the consumers of pork meat as to the use of fats of animal origin in the diet of pigs. High intake of animal fats by pigs leads to pork meat rich in SFA, which in turn increases the risk of cardiovascular disease in man. Consequently, consumers tend to prefer animal products derived from animals fed on diets containing oils of plant origin. The PUFA concentrations in pork meat can be raised by feeding pigs diets rich in PUFA, but the impact on physical meat quality was not known. From biochemical studies it follows that PUFAs are preferentially oxidised when compared to SFA. Thus, it could be suggested that the inclusion of vegetable oils into the diets for pigs would alter the metabolism of fatty acids and energy. The main question that was addressed in this thesis is as follows: What is the effect of feeding diets containing either sunflower oil (SO) or beef tallow (BT) on meat quality and fatty acid and energy metabolism? Variables measured were the incorporation of fatty acids into adipose tissue, meat and the whole body, the oxidation and de novo fatty acid synthesis of fatty acids and energy expenditure. The feeding of diets with SO instead of BT did not affect growth performance, but markedly increased the level of linoleic acid (LA) in adipose tissues and pork meat without any adverse effect on the physical aspects of pork quality. The digestibility of crude fat and fatty acids was higher for the SO diets, except for the digestibility of stearic acid. The SO diets raised the oxidation of LA and the de novo synthesis of SFA synthesis. To study fatty acid metabolism at the level of the whole body, the relatively small, Thai indigenous pigs were used as a model. In these pigs the metabolism of LA and ALA was compared after feeding diets with a low or high LA:ALA ratio. Adipose tissue and pork of the pigs fed on the high-ALA diet were enriched with ALA. The ratios of deposition: digestible intake for LA and ALA were lower than 1, indicating preferential oxidation of these fatty acids, which was associated with increased de novo synthesis of SFA synthesis in keeping with the studies in commercial pigs. For both the high-ALA and high-LA diet, the rate of ALA incorporation into the whole body was lesser than for LA, which is in line with preferential oxidation of ALA over LA. In a subsequent study, ALA metabolism was studied in pigs fed ALA-rich diets with identical levels of either SO or BT as fat background. It was found that the digestion and deposition of LA, de novo synthesis of SFA synthesis and ALA oxidation were higher, whereas ALA deposition was lower for the SO diet. It is concluded that the fat background of the diet can affect metabolism of supplemental fatty acids. In order to assess the digestibility of fatty acids more accurately, cannulated pigs were used to determine apparent ileal digestibility instead of faecal digestibility of fatty acids. The apparent ileal digestibility of fatty acids was found to be lower than apparent feacal digestibility, except for that of stearic acid. The aberrant outcome for stearic acid indicates that C18 unsaturated fatty acids are escaping from ileal digestion and are hydrogenated and transformed into C18 saturated fatty acids by microbes in the large intestine. Energy expenditure and proximate body composition was not influenced by the type of fat in the diet.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['In general, human aging is considered one of the most complex and less-well understood process in biology. In this thesis the possibilities of proteomics technology in the field of aging were explored. The complexity of the aging process was supposed to accompanied by relatively subtle proteome variations, which made the application of the proteomics technology a real challenge. The use of two-dimensional In Gel Electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) technology enabled a reduction of the analytical variation and allowed the use of biological replicates, which increased the significance of annotated biological processes inducing the observed proteome differences. A part of the work described in this thesis was to analyse the influence of cellular aging (i.e replicative senescence) on protein expression in an endothelial cell model system, called HUVECS. Cellular aging of endothelial cells has been detected in vivo in atherosclerotic lesions and is therefore considered to be important in the development of the age-related disease atherosclerosis. This study showed that endothelial replicative senescence might be accompanied with increased cellular stress, protein biosynthesis and reduction in DNA repair and maintenance. Also remarkable differences were observed concerning the cellular architecture, which could be confirmed with electron microscopy. Next to cellular aging we were also interested in age-related changes on the organismal level and for that purpose pooled human plasma samples from three different healthy age groups were subjected also to 2D-DIGE. Functional analysis revealed that during healthy aging, a pro-inflammatory as well as an increased pro-coagulant state becomes evident. The most remarkable observation was the high upregulation of complement C3 splicing products, which suggests that the immune response becomes enhanced in the healthy elderly group. Apparently, a pro-inflammatory as well as pro-coagulant state might be necessary for healthy aging. In a second explorative 2D-DIGE study, in which we have compared plasma samples from healthy and unhealthy individuals at the age of >85, these states appeared to be reduced in the unhealthy population. In conclusion, the application of 2D DIGE resulted in the discovery of changes in the expression of several proteins during cellular and human aging.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Strategies in liver surgery'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Partial liver resection is major surgery with an associated morbidity rate in our study group of 23% and a mortality rate of 5.8%. The most important risk factor for developing postoperative complications is blood loss and consequently, the administration of packed red blood cells. Most of the blood loss occurs during the transection phase. New precoagulation devices significantly decrease the blood loss during transection of the liver without applying the Pringle maneuver, when compared to ultrasonic dissection. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Netherlands the most important indication for partial liver resection is the presence of colorectal metastases. During surgery intraoperative ultrasound (IOUS) is performed to identify and localize the colorectal metastases and their relation with major vascular and biliar structures. In spite of the high specificity of IOUS, the recurrence rate after partial liver resection is substantial, implying that small metastases remain undetected using IOUS. In our series the addition of contrast did not significantly improve the diagnostic accuracy of IOUS, mainly as a result of the adequacy of IOUS. In a selected population partial liver resection is the sole potentially curative treatment and is associated with a 5-year survival rate of 38%. However, only 20-25% of patients with colorectal liver metastases are eligible for partial liver resection. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn selected patients unresectable metastases can be treated with radiofrequency ablation (RFA). With this method a high-frequency alternating current is applied through a needle electrode inserted directly into the tumor. This alternating current induces hyperthermia, resulting in coagulative necrosis. Introduction of RFA in the Netherlands has been accompanied by unacceptably high recurrence rates. Patients must be selected very carefully. Currently, the most promising local recurrence rates have been reported for small tumors (< 3cm) treated by laparoscopy or laparotomy. Moreover, an evident learning curve has been described for this technique, which can be overcome by concentrating patients in specialized centers. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA strategy to extend the number of patients treated surgically is the combination of partial liver resection and local ablation. The aim of this strategy is to resect the bulk of disease or larger tumors followed by local ablation of any residual unresectable liver tumor, while preserving adequate hepatic reserve. This combination is remarkable, since local ablation, in contrast to partial liver resection, should still be considered a palliative intervention. Consequently, partial liver resection with its associated morbidity is performed in a palliative setting. The initial results of this strategy in the Netherlands show that the postoperative morbidity and mortality are similar to those reported after partial liver resection alone. \\r\\nPartial liver resection for benign disease is an effective procedure to relieve invalidating abdominal symptoms. Since partial liver resection is associated with substantial morbidity and even mortality it should be considered only in patients with severe or progressive symptoms and, because of the risk of spontaneous rupture or malignant degeneration, in patients with a large hepatocellular adenoma (>5cm).'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Cationic polymers for nuclaic acid delivery to tumors'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['In the field of cancer gene therapy, the use of gene carrier systems is considered indispensable. Cationic polymers are able to effectively condense plasmid DNA to nano-sized particles, further referred to as polyplexes. Compared to free DNA, polyplexes have shown improved nuclease-resistance, a more efficient uptake by the target cells, and enhanced transfection activity. However, clinical introduction of polyplex-systems is hampered by concerns regarding toxicity and the extent and duration of gene expression mediated by the systems. Biodegradable cationic polymers show promise in non-viral gene delivery as they are likely to limit the long-term toxicity of polyplexes. Additionally, biodegradable polymers might also positively affect the gene expression profile mediated by polyplexes. So far, polyplexes based on biodegradable polymers have demonstrated low cytotoxicity and considerable in vitro transfection activity. Few studies reported on the in vivo transfection and toxicity characteristics of biodegradable polymers for gene delivery. In this thesis different biodegradable polymers were investigated for their in vivo tumor transfection properties in mice, after local as well as systemic administration. Different intravenously administered non-degradable cationic carriers were assessed for their capability to deliver nucleic acids to a distant tumor site. In addition, further optimization was explored by addressing the effect of polymer molecular weight and the bacterial motifs present in plasmid DNA on the tumor transfection activity of polyplexes. The in vivo evaluation of biodegradable polymers in this study has led to the identification of two gene delivery systems with considerable in vivo tumor transfection activities, i.e. p(DMAEA)-ppz and pHPMA-DMAE. Interestingly, the i.v. administration of p(DMAEA)-ppz yielded a tumor selective gene expression. The benefits of several advanced non-degradable carrier systems to deliver nucleic acids to a distant tumor site could not be attributed to benefits relevant during the transport phase. Rather, the benefits might be attributed to carrier-induced changes in the intratumoral processing of the nucleic acids. Finally, major improvements in the in vivo transfection efficiency/toxicity ratio of polyplex systems could be established by controlling the molecular weight of the polymeric vehicle and by the replacement of CpG motifs within the plasmid of the polyplexes.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Cryptococcus neoformans (Cn) and Cryptococcus gattii (Cg) are closely related pathogenic yeasts that may cause meningo-encephalitis, which is fatal if left untreated. Cn and Cg differ in host range and geographic occurrence. Cn mainly infects immunocompromised people and occurs worldwide, whereas Cg may cause infections in otherwise healthy people and is found predominantly in (sub)tropical regions. Six major haploid genotypic groups have consistently been distinguished in molecular studies of Cn and Cg. Two of them correspond to the varieties of Cn: var. grubii and var. neoformans. Within Cg four major genotypic groups have consistently been found, but these groups have not been described as separate taxa. The taxonomic status of the major genotypic groups within the Cn - Cg species complex and the interactions between the genotypic groups were studied. Six major monophyletic lineages, which correspond to the previously described genotypic groups could be identified when six nuclear regions were analyzed. In addition, the isolates clustered in the same major monophyletic lineage for all regions studied, which indicates that recombination between the monophyletic lineages has not occurred. Surprisingly, some isolates of one of the Cg genotypic groups possessed mitochondrial sequences (partially) identical to those of another Cg genotypic group. The identification of Cg isolates which possess a nuclear genome belonging to one genotypic group and a mitochondrial genome (partially) belonging to another genotypic group suggests that mating or somatic fusion has occurred between these two genotypic groups. Diploid or aneuploid hybrid isolates have been found which result from mating between the two varieties. Hybrids between Cn and Cg had never been isolated from a patient or the environment. Surprisingly, three clinical isolates were discovered that were hybrids between Cn var. neoformans and Cg. In addition, one clinical isolate was found that was a hybrid between Cn var. grubii and Cg. These four hybrids probably result from mating between isolates of Cn and Cg. Our results combined with results from other studies suggest that Cn and Cg have almost completed speciation. Cn and Cg are morphologically and physiologically different and formed sister groups for all studied regions. Hybrids between Cn and Cg are rare, suggesting that most hybrids are inviable. Therefore, the current two species status of Cn and Cg is probably justified. The two varieties within Cn started to diverge more recently. The two varieties have physiological differences and formed monophyletic lineages for all regions studied. However, Cn hybrids are found often and mating experiments have generated fertile progeny and haploid recombinants, indicating that the two varieties are not yet species. The Cg genotypic groups started to diverge even more recently. The genotypic groups do not differ physiologically, but can be distinguished by differences in the nuclear genome using, e.g. Luminex xMAP technology. Analyses of nuclear regions distinguished four monophyletic lineages, but the identification of Cg isolates which possess a nuclear genome belonging to one genotypic group and a mitochondrial genome (partially) belonging to another genotypic group suggests that mating has occurred between two Cg genotypic groups. These results indicate that the Cg genotypic groups might be described as varieties.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Glucocorticoids (GC) have inhibitory actions on solid tumor growth due to suppressive effects on tumor angiogenesis and inflammation. When evaluating the preclinical studies on solid tumor growth inhibition, it appears that GC-induced antitumor effects are achieved by using substantially higher doses than the minimal doses needed to achieve inhibition of inflammatory disease processes. The high doses of GC used in these antitumor studies resulted in death of some of the animals due to opportunistic infections, indicating that severe systemic side effects can occur. As GC are also rapidly cleared from the circulation, and localize at tumor sites only to a very limited extent, targeted delivery of GC to tumor tissue is an attractive strategy to increase intratumoral drug concentrations. A strategy investigated for GC targeting to tumors is the incorporation of GC into long-circulating liposomes (LCL). Our previous studies showed that prednisolone phosphate (PLP) encapsulated in LCL (LCL-PLP) can inhibit tumor growth after intravenous administration (i.v.). These antitumor effects of LCL-PLP are the result of the tumor-targeting property of the liposome formulation. The mechanism by which LCL-PLP inhibits tumor growth is unclear. Therefore, the primary aim of this thesis was to investigate the mechanisms of action of LCL-encapsulated GC that could explain their inhibitory effects on murine tumor models. We investigated the effects of liposome-encapsulated PLP versus free PLP on angiogenic protein production in tumor tissue in vivo and on viability and proliferation of tumor and endothelial cells in vitro. Taken together, our studies point to a strong inhibitory effect of liposomal PLP on tumor angiogenesis by reduction of the intratumoral production of the majority of pro-angiogenic factors produced by tumor-associated macrophages (TAM). To evaluate whether this finding can be generalized to other types of GC, we encapsulated GC other than PLP in LCL for targeting to tumor tissue. The antitumor activity, adverse effects, and mechanisms of action of LCL containing synthetic GC other than prednisolone were investigated. In addition to prednisolone, the following GC as phosphate derivatives were tested: budesonide disodium phosphate, dexamethasone disodium phosphate, and methylprednisolone disodium phosphate. They were selected due to their difference in the ranking order of their potency in terms of activation of the human glucocorticoid receptor. All liposomal glucocorticoids exerted strong antitumor effects which are enabled by the tumor-targeting property of the long-circulating liposome formulation that increases intratumoral drug concentration and prolongs the inhibitory effects. LCL-encapsulated GC showed different potencies on different pathways involved in tumor angiogenesis and inflammation. We also tested the antitumor effects of LCL containing therapeutic agents other than GC. Interestingly, statins with a primary activity not related to angiogenesis (e.g. cholesterol lowering in cardiovascular diseases) also possessed anti-angiogenic activity on tumor growth when they are tumor-targeted delivered. Finally our studies provide a comparison between the antitumor effects of DoxilTM or CaelyxTM (in Europe) (doxorubicin entrapped in LCL) and LCL-PLP. These results suggest that Doxil does not act primarly through TAM. The antitumor activity of Doxil seems to be primarily the result of cytotoxic effects on tumor cells.'],\n",

       "  'Description': [\"Working and communicating with and across nations and nationalities makes cultural differences a permanent part of everyday reality in multinational organisations like the European Commission. It has been frequently argued that nationality forms an important basis for forming networks in and around the European Union (EU) institutions due to the ease of establishing communication and connection resulting from sharing a culture. In the case of Commission officials, there are two competing forces that could potentially shape their networks: their nationality (via their cultural identity) and supranationality (via their organisational belonging). As an individual, Commission officials might prefer to form their networks with officials who are culturally similar to them since this eases communication and cooperation. The supranational values and the multinational setting of the Commission, however, might make such a preference impossible or inappropriate to put into practice. This is the overall puzzle underlying this research on the networking patterns of Commission officials. This book addresses the research questions, 'Do Commission officials have national networks? Why or why not?' It takes a systematic approach to investigating networks, beginning with the deconstruction of the concept itself. Theoretically and methodologically, this study takes a multidisciplinary angle by borrowing from and relying on theories and tools of public administration, political science, organisational sociology and anthropology. Empirical material constitutes the heart of this thesis, consisting of 82 interviews with Commission officials in four Directorates-General and five months of participant observation in the Commission. The data is analysed by combining qualitative and quantitative methods. The empirical evidence shows that same nationality contacts are the exception rather than the rule for task-related purposes. There are also no significant differences between nationalities in terms of 'sticking to each other'. The only exception is the case of large member state officials, an occurrence which is explained by the officials to be a sheer effect of numbers of officials each member state has. Officials do not contact fellow nationals just because they come from the same country. Nor do Commission officials allow cultural convenience to determine whom they will turn to. Commission officials are specialised in specific files which in some cases require very specific technical or scientific expertise. This is a world where the dividing lines are not drawn by country maps but by functional maps, the content of which are shaped by the needs and concerns of the policy sector officials belong to, given by the Directorate-General they are working in. Commission officials have gone beyond the myth of nationality through their international backgrounds and their experience in a multinational working environment.\"],\n",

       "  'Description': ['In the evaluation of the effect of different treatments well-conducted randomized controlled trials have been widely accepted as the scientific standard. When on the other hand observational studies are used to assess treatment effects, the absence of a randomized assignment of treatments will in general result in treatment groups that are systematically different on factors that can be alternative explanations for the observed treatment effect. Therefore, in these types of studies is adjustment for confounding necessary. An overview of such methods is given and two methods are further described, evaluated and applied in real data sets. Furthermore, improvements are suggested. One of these adjustment methods, propensity scores, is increasingly used in the medical literature as an alternative for traditional regression-based methods like logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards regression. Nonetheless, an important advantage of propensity scores is frequently overlooked by researchers, that is, its treatment effect estimate is in general closer to the true average treatment effect than regression methods using the odds ratio or the hazard ratio. The difference can be substantial, especially when the number of confounding factors is more than 5, the treatment effect is larger than an odds ratio of 1.25 (or smaller than 0.8) or the incidence proportion is between 0.05 and 0.95. An important step in the application of propensity score methods is the creation of the propensity score model, including the check for balance. In many applications this model is routinely chosen and information on the balance of covariates between treatment groups is missing. We proposed to use a measure for balance, the overlapping coefficient, to select the best propensity score model and to report the amount of balance uniformly. Its inverse association with bias and the low mean squared error support the use of this measure. For smaller sample sizes the method does not seem to work well for model selection purposes. We also explored alternative measures, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance and the Lévy metric, but these were slightly less promising. The other adjustment method that has been evaluated, is the method of instrumental variables. Its potential ability to adjust for all confounders, whether observed or not is an attractive property. We applied this method on censored survival data and used the difference in survival probabilities as the treatment effect. Formulas for standard errors are provided, which can be large in absolute value in case of a low number of events or at the end of the survival curve. Nonetheless, this method is worthwile when a suitable instrumental variable can be found or can be created. In the literature a warning can be found against a weak correlation between the instrumental variable and treatment. We demonstrated the existence of an upper bound on this correlation, which can be a practical limitation when considerable confounding exists. This can result in a fairly weak instrument in order to fulfill the main assumption of the method, or worse, can indicate a violation of the main assumption when the instrumental variable turns out to be strong.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Colorectal liver metastases: local therapy and molecular aspects'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most prevalent malignancies in the western world. Mortality is strongly associated with the formation of liver metastases, which eventually occurs in about 50% of patients. Once liver metastases have developed, the natural course of the disease is associated with poor survival rates. In this thesis we have focused on local ablation for unresectable liver metastases and on some of the molecular processes involved in colorectal cancer and metastases formation. Locally ablative therapies such as laser-induced thermotherapy (LITT) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) are gaining acceptance in the treatment of unresectable liver metastases. In this thesis, we found that with the latest technique of LITT and RFA we are able to produce large coagulation lesions. Consequently, LITT and RFA are good alternatives for patients who are not suitable for surgical resection, aiming at curation with less complications. A major limitation of these local ablative therapies is the production of lesions with sufficient tumor-free margin. We have established a murine tumor model for solitary liver metastasis in which recurrent tumor growth occurs after LITT. Our results support the concept that combined LITT and adjuvant chemotherapeutic treatment can increase the extent of tumor destruction. Thus, additional chemotherapy after LITT may induce maximal efficacy and improve survival in patients with colorectal liver metastases. Activating mutations in the KRAS oncogene are frequently observed during the early stages of colorectal cancer. We have analyzed the effect of suppression of the mutant KRAS allele by RNA interference in a highly aggressive mouse CRC cell line (C26). After KRAS knockdown, the incidence of subcutaneous tumor formation was spectacularly reduced, the lag time was increased and KRAS-knockdown tumors grew noninvasively and did not cause morbidity. Surprisingly, KRAS-knockdown tumors elicited an anti-tumor immune response that resulted in spontaneous regression in some KRAS-knockdown tumors. In conclusion, the reduced incidence of tumor formation by KRAS knockdown tumor cells is at least in part a result of tumor cell clearance by the host immune system and not to an intrinsic inability of these cells to grow out as a tumor. Mutant KRAS in CRC cells enhances their metastatic potential and invasiveness, and facilitates immune evasion. This makes mutant KRAS an interesting therapeutic target for treatment against metastases of CRC. The Wnt, Notch, and TGFbeta signaling pathways control tissue homeostasis and tumor development in the intestine. These same pathways are also involved in the trans-differentiation of epithelial tumor cells into cells with mesenchymal characteristics, a process that shares some features with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Liver metastases of CRC demonstrated low levels of activated Notch en TGFbeta signaling components, suggesting these signaling pathways are less involved in metastases growth. These findings have important consequences for the use of inhibitors that target these pathways in the treatment against metastatic colorectal cancer.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Cryopreservation of ovarian tissue is a promising technique to rescue animal species and breeds from extinction and to restore fertility of women after cancer treatment. Establishment of cryopreservation protocols starts by choosing the most efficient cryoprotective agents, the dimension of ovarian fragments, the volume of the cryoprotectant solution, the addition of extra-cellular cryoprotectant, and efficient methods to evaluate follicular quality. Based on these parameters, caprine ovarian tissue was successfully cryopreserved when cortical fragmented in pieces (~ 1mm3) exposed to a low volume (frozen in 1 ml or vitrified in 0.5 ml) of a combination of ethylene glycol and sucrose, according to analysis based on viability markers to assure follicular viability. However, cellular viability after cryopreservation does not guarantee follicular development. It was observed that cryopreserved early-staged follicles show a significant decline in quality after having them in vitro cultured for 24 h. One of the damage effects caused by cryoprotectants is called osmotic stress, because of the high osmolality of the cryoprotective agents. It has been demonstrated that high concentrations of cryoprotectants, e.g. 4.0 M EG (5242 mOsm), are not responsible for osmotic damage. On the other hand, when early-staged follicles were exposed to an ionic solution of 9 %  NaCl (2800 mOsm), most of the cells (92 % ) had lost their viability, showing that ions are the cause the cellular damage and not the cryoprotectants (non-ionic solutes). The aim of cryopreservation of early-staged follicles is storage for an undetermined time without viability impairment, followed by further complete development after thawing/warming. Despite the success obtained with the complete in vitro development of cryopreserved early-staged murine follicles, including development of frozen-thawed follicles followed by successful fertilization, embryo development and healthy offspring, similar success is difficult to achieve with large mammals in vitro. There is no protocol for complete in vitro development of early-staged follicles from large mammals. Thus, the importance of transplantation to obtain complete follicular development after cryopreservation. Success of the cryopresevation procedure was demonstrated by the complete follicular development (from primordial to pre-ovulatory stages) after freezing-thawing of ovarian tissue fragments and their re-implantation in ovariectomised donor goats. Thereby, ovarian cortical fragments re-modulated into a new ovarian-like organ, from which blood supply and endocrine function (oestradiol and progesterone production) were restored. The next step before clinical application, consist in evaluate some remaining points related to cryopreservation and transplantation. For example, absence of DNA damage and high survival rate of early-staged follicles after cryopreservation, does not mean that cooling cannot affect DNA by activating genes related to diseases and malformations. Thus, more experiments should be performed in adequate animal models, such as the goat, until data can be satisfactorily repeated and normal offspring can be guaranteed. Finally, although cryopreservation of ovarian tissue should not be promoted to postpone childbearing in healthy women, such a technique may be used in the future for safeguarding maternity for women requiring chemo- or radiotherapy. In addition, it may in the near future be an important technique for the preservation of endangered breeds and species.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Following cardiac diseases such as an insufficient valve or a myocardial infarction, the heart attempts to adapt to the new situation. The heart can adapt its structure or contractility, but it can also adapt its electrical properties. This phenomenon is called electrical remodelling and is associated with an increased sensitivity to lethal ventricular arrhythmias. This electrical remodelling is of importance in patients with congestive heart failure because it leads to sudden cardiac death in about 50% of the cases in this population. In this thesis, several aspects contributing to electrical remodeling have been studied. In patients with end-stage heart failure, a genetic variant has been studied which might lead to an increase in electrical remodelling. In the same patient group, it was found that a heterogeneous distribution of a cell-cell communication protein was associated with a higher risk for the development of arrhythmias. An attempt was made to relieve electrical remodeling using pacemakers and ventricular assist devices. This was only partially possible. After the treatment, a substrate for the development of arrhythmias remained present.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Reverse remodeling of the extracellular matrix in heart failure after left ventricular mechanical support'],\n",
       "  'Description': [\"This thesis describes a study of the changes in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the myocardium, in patients with end stage heart failure and during mechanical support (Left Ventricular Assist Device support, LVAD) of the left ventricle. The changes during LVAD support may lead to recovery of the heart. Chapter 1 is a general introduction about heart failure, heart transplantation, and the LVAD, The process of remodeling which leads to heart failure, and of reverse remodeling during LVAD support. A summary is given of the ECM components, and of the role of enzymes, hormones, and cytokines in the myocardial ECM changes in patients before and after LVAD support. Chapter 2 gives an overview of the role of different cytokine polymorphisms in transplant rejection. Cytokines influence each other's function and production. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the genes of cytokines may influence the production level. These SNPs have been studied extensively in the context of acute rejection after organ transplantation. A variety of results have been obtained by many different groups. The main focus in most studies has been SNP genotype of the recipient. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that, in addition to the recipient's immune system, the microenvironment of the donor organ does also contribute to cytokine production, and may thereby influence rejection events. Chapter 3 concerns a study of TNF alpha promoter polymorphisms, and their possible contribution to the severity of heart failure and transplant rejection. TNF? plasma levels were measured before heart transplantation, in patients on medication, and in patients supported by a LVAD. TNF alpha plasma levels were high in patients with end stage heart failure on pharmaco-therapy, compared to healthy controls, but were increased in patients which required LVAD support before heart transplantation. This increase seems to correlate with the G allele at position -308. After LVAD support the TNF alpha levels were decreased. The A allele at position -308 (in which A is associated with relatively high levels of TNF alpha) does not correlate with the severity of heart failure and transplant rejection. However, patients having donor hearts with the A-308 polymorphism suffered more rejection episodes than patients receiving hearts with the G allele. Chapter 4 deals with the changes in the fibrillar collagen network in the ECM. The cardiomyocyte size appeared to decreases by 36% in the first 100 days after LVAD support. This was paralleled by an increase in ECM volume. However, the ECM volume decreased after prolonged LVAD support (>365 days). In patients with end-stage heart failure, the degradation of the fibrillar collagens was high before LVAD support, and their synthesis was low compared to the healthy controls. After LVAD support the opposite was observed: increased synthesis of the fibrillar collagens and decreased degradation. Furthermore, we showed that the quality of the fibrillar collagens increases, because more un-denatured (uncoiled) collagen was detected. These results suggest that after LVAD support the heart becomes smaller and the fibrillar collagen network in the ECM improves. Chapter 5 describes the changes in the basement membrane (BM) surrounding the cardiomyocytes. Using quantitative PCR (QPCR), no changes were observed in terms of collagen α-chain mRNA expression . However, immunohistochemistry did disclose a decreased staining pattern of type IV collagen after LVAD support. Using electron microscopy we showed that in healthy control hearts, and in patients with severe end-stage heart failure, the BM is thick and irregular, in contrast to patients after LVAD support. There were close connections between the ECM collagen fibers and the BM. Post-LVAD the BM became more regular and the lamina lucida and lamina densa were compacter and could be clearly discerned then in the healthy control. However, the connection between the BM and the collagen fibers in the ECM appeared to be disturbed. Furthermore, it was investigated whether matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) plays a role in degradation of the BM. MMP-2, which is able to degrade type IV collagen, was high in patients before LVAD support, but was increased even more in patients on LVAD support. Using gel zymography, active MMP expression was increased in these patients and was localized in the BM. This suggests that MMP-2 degrades type IV collagen in the BM during LVAD support. Chapter 6 focuses on the role of neuro-hormone brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) in the remodeling process. BNP is a member of the natriuretic peptide family and is mainly synthesized and secreted in the left cardiac ventricle. BNP is known to have natriuretic, diuretic and vasorelaxant properties,and have antagonistic effects on the renin-angiotensin-aldosteron system; it is increased in patients with end-stage heart failure. Measurement of BNP plasma levels is of prognostic value for the assessment of cardiac morbidity and mortality. We did observe an increase of BNP in patients with end-stage heart failure. After LVAD, the BNP plasma levels were decreased. Immuno-histochemical staining indicated that, apart from cardiomyocytes, infiltrating T-cells are also capable of producing BNP. Chapter 7 describes the role of cathepsin K in the remodelings process. Cathepsin K mRNA and protein expression were high in patients with end stage heart failure before LVAD support. However, after LVAD support the mRNA expression was increased, but the protein level decreased. Immunohistochemistry disclosed that the macrophages in the heart are the main producers of cathepsin K. After LVAD support, their number was decreased. These results indicate that cathepsin K plays an important role in the remodeling process in patients before LVAD support. Chapter 8 is a general discussion of the investigations included in this thesis. Currently, LVADs serve as bridge to heart transplantation and, in some patients, even as bridge to recovery. However, recovery of the heart during LAVD support is generally neither complete nor permanent. In this thesis it is demonstrated that the cardiomyocytes, the ECM volume, and the fibrillar collagen network improves in quality and even almost normalizes. Yet, degradation of the basement membrane and of the connections between the collagens in the BM and the cardiomyocytes did also occur. Such connections are very important for the transmission of force between the cardiomyocytes, and as long as they are not restored, LVAD as a temporary tool for recovery would not appear to be a realistic option.\"],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Rehabilitation in cancer: Training and talking? Effects of physical training versus physical training combined with cognitive-behavioural therapy'],\n",
       "  'Description': [\"Objective. As a result of recent advances in diagnosis and treatment, the number of people surviving cancer is increasing. A subgroup of cancer survivors report long-lasting physical and psychological complaints including decreased cardiorespiratory capacity, decreased physical functioning, and decreased quality of life (QoL). Physical and psychological rehabilitation had beneficial effects on cancer survivors' physical fitness and QoL. Physical training appeared to have a primarily positive effect on the physical and functional aspects of QoL, whereas cognitive-behavioural therapy was shown to be beneficial for the psychosocial aspects. Therefore, compared to a single intervention, combining physical training with cognitive-behavioural therapy may lead to greater improvements in QoL by having benefits on both physical and psychosocial functioning. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to determine the effects of a group-based combined self-management physical and cognitive-behavioural intervention (PT+CBT) on the physical fitness and quality of life of cancer survivors compared to group-based self-management physical training (PT) and a waiting list control group (WLC). Methods. Between February 2004 and January 2007, a total of 209 cancer survivors (all cancer types, medical treatment completed at least three months ago) were recruited and were randomly assigned to 12-week PT+CBT (n=76) or 12-week PT (n=71), or participated in WLC (n=62). The WLC group consisted of cancer survivors on a waiting-list using the same inclusion criteria. QoL was measured using the EORTC-QLQ-C30 and the RAND-36. Physical fitness was assessed by means of an exhaustive exercise test and muscle strength testing. Physical activity levels were determined using the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly. The intervention groups were measured at baseline and post-intervention. QoL was also assessed at three and nine months post-intervention. The WLC group was measured at baseline and 12 weeks later. Results. The sample compromised 179 women and 30 men. The age of participants ranged from 18 to 74 years with a mean of 49.9 years. 57.4% survivors were diagnosed with breast cancer, 15.8% with haematological cancer, 11.5% with gynaecological cancer and 15.3% with other types of cancer. In terms of treatment, 84.7% had surgery, 67.5% received chemotherapy and 58.9% received radiation therapy. There was no difference in changes of QoL, physical fitness and physical activity between PT and PT+CBT at the short-term as well as, concerning QoL, at the long-term. Compared to control, participants in both intervention groups exhibited significant and clinically relevant improvements in role limitations due to physical problems, physical functioning, vitality and health change. Furthermore, peak exercise capacity and muscle strength of the lower limb of PT+CBT and PT participants were increased after the intervention compared to the control subjects. Conlusion. The intensive, supervised, group-based physical training programme that integrated principles of self-management and the advantages of peer contact improved cancer survivors' physical fitness and QoL. Combining the physical training with a cognitive-behavioural intervention did not add to these beneficial effects of physical training neither in the short-term nor in the long-term.\"],\n",

       "  'Description': ['In cancer management early diagnosis is crucial for successful treatment. Unfortunately, patients mostly present with advanced disease, limiting therapeutic options. Therefore, screening of the general population for cancer can enhance earlier diagnosis and better treatment, decreasing cancer mortality. Furthermore, close monitoring of patients enables early detection of relapse and more efficient treatment. As proteins reflect the actual state of an organism and are readily measurable in biological matrices such as blood, they can excellently fulfil a role as biomarkers for cancer. Especially the development of mass spectrometry has enhanced fast and easy analysis of the protein content of (clinical) samples. We applied surface-enhanced laser desorption ionisation-time of flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS) for the detection of new potential biomarkers for colorectal cancer (CRC) and renal cell cancer (RCC). In a retrospective study, serum protein patterns comprising, among others, apolipoprotein C-I were found that could reliably discriminate patients with advanced CRC from healthy persons. Furthermore, combination of these patterns with the currently used CRC marker CEA showed better performance than CEA alone. The decrease of apolipoprotein C-I serum levels in CRC was validated in a prospective study in patients with mostly early-stage CRC, adenomatous polyps (AP) and controls with an indication for colonoscopy. Comparable to CEA, apolipoprotein C-I levels did not return to normal immediately after surgical resection of the tumour, but gradually within 3 months. In colorectal tissue of these patients, several proteins which were gradually changing in abundance between control, AP and CRC, or between the different histologic subtypes of AP were found. Further structural identification of these proteins can provide insight into the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying or accompanying the development of CRC. For clinical application as a biomarker, quantitative analyses for apolipoprotein C-I need to be developed to establish reliable cut-off levels to identify patients with CRC. Furthermore, strict sample handling protocols are essential for proteomic investigations, as e.g. proteolysis during storage can severely alter protein profiles. To investigate the validity and robustness of reported serum protein profiles for RCC, two distinct patient populations of RCC and controls were assessed in our laboratory. One of the proposed RCC biomarker candidates was indeed validated, but many others were not, exemplifying problems with analytical reproducibility and statistical problems of data over-fitting. Using a new analytical protocol, two new RCC protein profiles could be defined. Since sensitivity and specificity were 60-85%, these profiles are presently not suitable for use in diagnostic screening, although they might have a role in follow-up of RCC patients. However, a five-protein serum profile predicting RCC prognosis could be identified and was demonstrated to be a strong and independent predictor of survival when tested against the extended Memorial Sloan-Kettering Prognostic Factors Model. Concluding, the development of high-throughput mass spectrometric protein profiling approaches such as SELDI-TOF MS has facilitated the comprehensive analysis of a large part of the proteome in clinical samples. Thus, this technique has shown to be very useful in the search for new biomarker candidates for CRC and RCC in human serum and tissue.'],\n",

       "  'Description': [\"Asthma is the most prevalent chronic disease in childhood. To study the actual prevalence and impact of undiagnosed childhood asthma in daily life (i.e. quality of life, participation in physical and school activities) we performed a survey in schoolchildren (aged 7-10 years) in the southern part of the Netherlands. Diagnosed asthma was defined as the parents’ confirmation of a physician’s diagnosis of asthma. Undiagnosed asthma was defined by asthma symptoms combined with airway reversibility or bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR). Our study shows that the majority of schoolchildren with asthma remain undiagnosed with a prevalence of 8%. The impact of undiagnosed asthma in daily life is substantial; i.e. children have a poorer lung function, lower quality of life scores and a higher school absence than their healthy peers. Furthermore, excessive bodyweight is associated with an additional decrease in quality of life in children with asthma. In addition our results show that children whose parents do not report a physician's diagnosis of asthma appear to perceive bronchoconstriction less well than children with diagnosed asthma. For a number of children this might be an explanation for a delay in asthma diagnosis. Childhood mild asthma - whether diagnosed or not - does not seem to be associated with a decreased level of daily physical activity compared with healthy controls. We found a high level of willingness among parents to visit their GP, as two thirds of our parents visited a physician after they had been informed that their child might suffer from asthma. Factors associated with refusal were high maternal education, mild symptoms and absence of airway reversibility. At the end of the program, medical treatment for asthma was started in two out of five children. High suspicion of undiagnosed asthma is warranted in school-age children with substantial school absence, respiratory symptoms or less specific symptoms (e.g. fatigue or sleeping problems).Children, caregivers, physicians and others involved in the daily life of children (e.g. teachers, sport trainers) can play an important role in recognizing asthma symptoms in the community. This might lead to important improvement of functioning and a decrease in the disability of schoolchildren.\"],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Vascular risk factors and adipocyte dysfunction in metabolic syndrome'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['The cluster of vascular risk factors closely associated with obesity, consists of fasting and postprandial dyslipidemia, hypertension, and insulin resistance, also known as metabolic syndrome, is associated with an increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In addition, adipose tissue in concordance with insulin resistance induces a pro-inflammatory and pro-atherogenic condition through the secretion of large quantities of pro-atherogenic, pro-inflammatory and pro-diabetic adipocytokines that influence lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, inflammatory and coagulation pathways and directly accelerate atherosclerosis. In this thesis the concept of ‘adipocyte dysfunction’ is presented. The work presented in this thesis is focused on 1] the relationship between metabolic risk factors associated with insulin resistance and adipocyte dysfunction and the occurrence of new cardiovascular events in patients with clinical manifest vascular disease, 2] the evaluation of the effect of lipid lowering therapy on postprandial lipid metabolism and endothelial function in obese patients with metabolic syndrome. Adiponectin is only produced by adipocytes and has potential anti-atherosclerotic properties and influences fatty acid and glucose metabolism (insulin resistance). We evaluated whether lower adiponectin plasma levels would also confer an increased vascular risk in a population of high-risk patients. It appeared that lower adiponectin plasma levels were associated with a decreased risk for vascular events in a large prospective cohort of patients with manifest vascular disease, even though the presence of metabolic syndrome was associated with lower adiponectin Low HDL-cholesterol plasma levels are a risk factor in healthy, non-treated subjects. In a large cohort of patients with manifest vascular diseases frequently using lipid-lowering therapy, low plasma HDL-cholesterol levels also confered an increased vascular risk. This relationship is irrespective of the localization of the disease or LDL-cholesterol levels, and independent of the use of lipid-lowering therapy. Obese metabolic syndrome patients have low fasting levels of HDL-cholesterol. We have shown that during an oral fat load, as a model of triglyceride-rich meal consumption, HDL-cholesterol levels further decrease. This dip is the result of high triglyceride levels and an increased synthesis of cholesteryl ester transfer protein, probably by dysfunctional adipocytes. This may contribute to the increased vascular risk seen in metabolic syndrome patients. In a randomized crossover trial, neither simvastatin nor simvastatin combined with ezetimibe could prevent this HDL-cholesterol dip. Postprandial hypertriglyceridemia is a key feature of metabolic syndrome due to reduced clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. As a result highly atherogenic small-dense lipoprotein particles are formed. In prevention the main focus is on lowering fasting LDL-cholesterol levels by either inhibiting cholesterol-synthesis (statin therapy), inhibition of intestinal cholesterol-absorption (ezetimibe) or by a combination of these two. Whether additional risk reduction can be achieved by preventing the development of this atherogenic postprandial lipoprotein profile by using ezetimibe in addition to a statin was unknown. As shown in the trial presented in this thesis, high-dose simvastatin and low dose simvastatin in combination with ezetimibe are equally effective in reducing postprandial lipoprotein concentrations and composition but show no effects on top of reduced fasting lipoprotein concentrations. Although no differences were observed between both treatment regimes in post fat load lipid levels or composition; simvastatin therapy combined with ezetimibe preserved endothelial function during the postprandial phase in contrast to high-dose of simvastatin alone.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['gerrit kouwenaar en de politiek van het lezen'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['The interpretation of the poetry of Gerrit Kouwenaar (1923) is a paradoxical undertaking. At first glance, his work seems easy to categorise. Ever since his official debut (1953), he has written poems in which the same every-day images constantly reoccur. Yet at the same time, critics disagree on the meaning of these images. Studies on Kouwenaar’s position in literary history confirm this paradox: readers acknowledge that his work is difficult to interpret, but they quickly agree on the terms and strategies necessary to define his oeuvre. In this study, I maintain that these paradoxes are the result of literary reading conventions, which are shared by an interpretive community of professional readers. My thesis (Chapter 1) is that Kouwenaar’s work not only invites readers to rely on such conventions, but also obscures and allegorises them, making the reader aware of their limitations. My approach combines an analysis of four conventions with a closer look at Kouwenaar’s best-known motifs. In Chapter 2, I argue that Kouwenaar’s reception has been influenced by the reading convention of poetic autonomy, which states that the poem ought to be regarded as an autonomous object. I demonstrate that this convention is self-contradictory, due to the fact that it does not account for the difference between the author’s perspective and that of the reader. In Chapter 3, I point out that Kouwenaar’s interview statements, in which he underscores the impersonal nature of his work, cause readers to rely on an anti-intentionalist reading convention. However, this convention again places the author on a pedestal, for readers support their ‘impersonal’ interpretation by referring to personal statements by the poet. I propose an alternative mode of interpretation, by relating the concept of intentionality to the intentions of the reader, instead of the author. Chapter 4 deals with the referential and the self-referential reading convention. The latter is based on the assumption that poetry does not refer to reality, but is a reality in its own right. The referential convention states that the poems do refer to a reality, if not a biographical reality. I argue that the two interpretive strategies are intertwined: it is only by referring to reality that the poems are open to allegorical, self-referential readings. Chapter 5 tackles the issue of literary engagement. According to some, Kouwenaar might have been politically engaged at the start of his career, but later adopted more autonomist views on literature. Others state that he has never ceased to write committed literature. I propose a distinction between two theories on literary engagement (one based on Sartre’s writings, the other based on Barthes’) and demonstrate how Kouwenaar’s poetry incites the reader to reflect on different forms of literary commitment. Finally, in the Conclusion I show how the problems raised by the interpretation of Kouwenaar’s work lie at the heart of modern poetry interpretation. The mechanisms at work in the reception point to a widespread politics of reading, which structures the work of most critics today. The shortcomings of this politics of reading reveal the need for a critical, creative mode of reading which employs the conventions of poetry interpretation as a culturally and historically situated institution.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional bowel disorder in which abdominal pain or discomfort is associated with a change in bowel habit, or with features of disordered defecation. Patients and doctors in primary care generally agree on IBS symptomatology and consider pain and bloating as its main features. Consultation behaviour is mainly driven by the severity of IBS symptomatology, rather than by its impact on quality of life or psychological distress. Irritable bowel syndrome is associated with a high prevalence of comorbidity. Before the diagnosis the comorbidity levels are comparable to the prevalence in a random sample of patients from primary care. Somatic comorbidity is a common feature in the year of IBS diagnosis and drops afterwards, while functional and psychiatric disorders remain prevalent. These patients might need targeted treatment approaches. The subjective measurement “adequate relief of abdominal pain and discomfort” is currently the best choice for the outcome assessment in IBS research. In addition, an integrated IBS symptom scale may be used as a secondary outcome measure, of which the IBS symptom severity scale (IBS SSS) is presently the best available instrument. Finally, the IBS quality of life score (IBS-QOL) is the preferred scale to asses changes in health-related quality of life. Based on recruitment analysis of this randomised controlled trial (RCT) we conclude that patients randomised in IBS research do differ from eligible IBS patients with respect to type and intensity of symptoms and disease history, which might influence the applicability of the trial results. Therapy with soluble and insoluble fibre confer distinct effects in IBS; long-term psylium (soluble fibre) is more effective than placebo in reducing IBS symptoms. In contrast, bran, an insoluble fibre, showed no favourable outcome compared to placebo. Psyllium seems the preferred treatment in IBS patients.'],\n",

Oral drug administration is convenient for patients and facilitates the use of continuous dosing regimens, which might lead to an increased antitumor activity. Gemcitabine is transported into cells by human nucleoside transporters and is intracellularly phosphorylated to its active metabolite gemcitabine triphosphate (dFdCTP). A clinical study in patients with advanced solid tumors who received oral dFdC at low dose-levels demonstrated extensive first-pass metabolism of dFdC to its main metabolite 2’,2’-difluorodeoxyuridine (dFdU). A sensitive LC-MS/MS method was developed to quantify dFdCTP in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients. The exposure to dFdC in plasma and to dFdCTP in PBMCs was low and did not significantly increase with dose. High levels of dFdUTP, the phosphorylated metabolite of dFdU, were obtained in PBMCs. The metabolite dFdU had a long terminal half-life (t1/2) of about 4 days. Our hypothesis was that dFdU accumulated in the liver, which was possibly associated with the hepatic toxicity observed in one patient. In vitro experiments demonstrated that dFdU is a good substrate for uptake by the concentrative nucleoside transporter type 1 (hCNT1), which is highly expressed in liver and kidney. This might contribute to (re)uptake of dFdU and to the long t1/2 of dFdU. Furthermore, we found that dFdU is phosphorylated to dFdUTP and incorporated into DNA and RNA, which positively correlated with the cytotoxicity of dFdU. In addition, the extent of DNA incorporation of dFdUTP and dFdCTP in human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells were comparable at equitoxic concentrations of dFdC and dFdU, suggesting comparable intrinsic toxicity of these molecules. An in vivo study in wild-type mice confirmed accumulation of dFdUTP in the liver after multiple oral dosing of dFdC. Clinical studies with novel oral formulations of paclitaxel without Cremophor EL (CrEL) co-administered with cyclosporin A (CsA), an inhibitor of P-gp, demonstrated an increase in apparent bioavailability of paclitaxel up to a maximum of 60%. A self-microemulsifying oily formulation of paclitaxel demonstrated a desirable systemic exposure to paclitaxel after oral administration in combination with CsA. The systemic exposure to paclitaxel from a polymeric capsule formulation was increased about two-fold after co-administration with CsA. Interestingly, the novel paclitaxel analogue BMS-275183, which had a lower affinity for P-gp than paclitaxel, resulted in considerable antitumor activity in patients with non-small cell lung cancer after oral administration at a twice weekly schedule. The prodrug MEN 4901/T-0128, consisting of the new camptothecin analogue T-2513 bound to a carboxymethyldextran polymer, showed partial responses in patients with colorectal cancer and head and neck cancer after single i.v. administration once every 6 weeks. MEN 4901/T-0128 demonstrated a long t1/2 of about 4.5 days. The dose-level of 1800 mg/m2 was tolerated and resulted in promising clinical activity.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['In this thesis we study how organisms adapt their metabolism to a changing environment. Metabolic adaptation occurs at different timescales. Organisms adapt their metabolism via metabolic regulation, which happens in the order of minutes to hours and via evolution, which takes many generations. Here we study the interplay between these timescales by studying the evolution of metabolic adaptation. In chapter 2, we develop an individual-oriented, spatial model of cells that evolve their lac operon promoter function. In this way we study what kind of promoter function evolves. The promoter function that evolves in the simulations is surprisingly similar to the experimentally observed promoter function. Furthermore we show that, in contrast to the current belief, the lac operon is not a bistable switch when induced by the natural inducer lactose. Only when induced by artificial inducers, the lac operon behaves bistably. We modified this model to incorporate the effect of stochasticity in gene expression. In this way we study the effect of stochasticity by comparing the results between the deterministic and stochastic model. We find that in our model cells avoid stochastic gene expression by evolving to larger repressed transcription rates and therefore we conclude that stochasticity in the lac operon is detrimental for the cells. In chapter 4 we study the mutational dynamics of massive gene loss. We find that the pattern of gene loss in S. cerevisiae cannot be explained by random single gene loss. If we however assume that large base pair deletions cause simultaneous deletion of neighboring genes, we can explain the pattern of gene loss in S. cerevisiae satisfactorily. This model predicts that genes that have smaller intergenic regions in a yeast species that did not underwent WGD are more likely to be both deleted in S. cerevisiae and this is exactly what we find in the data. In chapter 5 we study the effect of a WGD on the metabolic network of S. cerevisiae using metabolic modeling. We find that we can satisfactorily predict which genes are retained in duplicate after WGD. Furthermore, we predict that both transporter genes and genes functioning in glycolysis are more likely to be retained in duplicate after WGD, which we also found to be true in S. cerevisiae. Finally we show that a WGD can lead to a fitness increase in environments to which the cells are not yet perfectly adapted. Concluding, we have shown that combining detailed, quantitative modeling with an evolutionary, individual based approach is a promising way to study the evolution of biological systems. This approach has not only given us insight how, from an evolutionary point of view, such systems came about, but also how such systems work. Ignoring the evolutionary aspects of biological systems has, in the case of the lac operon, led to a wrong understanding of the dynamics of the system. Furthermore we have shown that even for such a large scale system as the metabolic network of S. cerevisiae, this approach leads to accurate predictions of the evolutionary outcome.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The work in this thesis focused on the relationship between presence of insulin resistance and advanced vascular damage in patients with manifest atherosclerotic vascular disease, and on the occurrence of (new) vascular events in insulin resistant patients with and without evident vascular disease. Also, the relationship between adipose tissue (abdominal fat and fat surrounding coronary arteries) and atherosclerotic vascular damage was examined. Patients with evident vascular disease or high insulin resistance (e.g. patients with metabolic syndrome or type 2 diabetes) are particularly prone to develop (new) vascular diseases. We demonstrated that metabolic syndrome, the clustering of vascular risk factors associated with insulin resistance, was highly prevalent (46%) in patients with manifest arterial disease. Also, an elevated level of insulin resistance was associated with an increased prevalence of albuminuria in patients with arterial disease. This association was only partly mediated by components of metabolic syndrome. High insulin resistance was not associated with an increased carotid intima-media thickness. Thus, insulin resistance may play a role in different stages of the atherosclerotic process. Another study showed that diabetic patients with cerebrovascular disease, coronary heart disease or peripheral arterial disease had a similar three- to fourfold higher risk of new vascular events, compared with diabetic patients without vascular disease. Diabetic patients with two or more clinical manifestations of atherosclerosis at different vascular sites had an even higher cardiovascular risk. Counting the number of sites of evident vascular disease, irrespective of the type of vascular disease, may help to simply identify those patients with diabetes type 2 particularly at very high risk for new macrovascular complications from a generally high-risk diabetic population. In case of obesity, an imbalanced production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines by abdominal fat not only induces insulin resistance and consequently metabolic syndrome, but also leads directly to the development of endothelial dysfunction and progression of atherosclerosis. We found that infrarenal aortic diameter was larger in patients with more intra-abdominal fat compared to those with less intra-abdominal fat, suggesting that intra-abdominal fat may play a role in the process of aortic dilatation. Also, there is growing evidence that the adipose tissue directly surrounding the coronary arteries may affect atherogenesis from ‘outside to inside’ by the local release of a large number of pro-inflammatory factors. We determined the reproducibility of various measurements (thickness, area, volume) for quantifying epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) and peri-coronary fat using cardiac CT scans of patients undergoing coronary angiography (CAG). Volumetric quantifications of EAT were highly reproducible (coefficient of variations (CVs) 3%-5%) compared to thickness and area measurements of EAT and peri-coronary fat (CVs 11%-23%). EAT and peri-coronary fat accumulations were both associated with obesity and presence of metabolic syndrome in these patients. EAT volume and peri-coronary fat thickness were not associated with the severity of coronary atherosclerosis and extent of CAC in the whole study population. Nonetheless, in patients with a BMI'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Micro-Connector Constructed Coronary Anastomosis - Device development and preclinical validation'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Coronary artery bypass grafting remains the most effective and durable treatment for severe coronary artery disease, but causes significant patient trauma. Efforts to improve the procedure by avoiding cardiopulmonary bypass and/ or by limiting the access are hampered by the increased difficulties of hand suturing the graft connections. Automated anastomotic devices may address these difficulties, provided that current performance standards are matched. For this purpose, the S micro-stapler has been developed. The device has been designed to minimize tissue trauma as well as intraluminal artefact and to provide an easy deployment procedure. To improve reliability, a specific sequence has been built-in, first presenting the tissue using device expansion prior to stapling. Accepted unconventional anastomosis properties are pulsatility non-compliance, inverted vessel wall apposition and a clipped, blind sac, resulting from converting the side-to-side geometry to an end-to-side configuration. Device dimensions are compatible with the majority of internal thoracic artery (ITA) to left anterior descending artery (LAD) anastomoses. Remote actuation minimizes undue movements during deployment, and allows endoscopic application. The preclinical validation included extensive in vitro tests using porcine as well as human tissue, and met preset standards. Chronic tests of the device compared anastomosis patency, remodeling and hemodynamic function to conventionally sutured controls in the off-pump porcine model. The connector rapidly and consistently produced high quality ITA to LAD anastomoses. Thirteen MHz epicardial ultrasound proved effective for intraoperatively assessing anastomosis quality, despite the presence of a metal connector. Evaluation at up to 6 months using angiography, fractional flow reserve measurements and intravascular ultrasound showed 100% patency with an effective vascular remodeling response, resulting in unobstructed anastomoses with excellent hemodynamic function in all cases. Histology showed a stabilized neo-intima on the inside of the anastomoses that was thinner than in the sutured controls. The device’s performance fully met current standards on patency and function. Unconventional aspects like a noncompliant intraluminal ring and a side-to-side to end-to-side converted configuration did not interfere with favorable anastomosis healing. To chart clinical failure modes and to assess the relevance to the S micro-stapler, all publications up to August 2007 on anastomotic devices that included systematic elective angiographic imaging were systematically reviewed. Marked outcome differences between individual devices were found, but could not be correlated to demographic, operative or follow-up differences, anticoagulation regime or device properties like expansion mode, pulsatility non-compliance, implant material or blood exposed non-intimal surface. Significant device and surgery related issues included graft thrombosis, graft kinking and stenosing intimal hyperplasia. Selected devices performed well, and showed that substantial equivalence to the gold standard of tailor-made, hand-sewn anastomoses is possible for automated, intrinsically standardized systems. The design characteristics of the S micro-stapler are well directed at avoiding the observed patency issues, and support expectations of favorable clinical results. In conclusion, reliable anastomotic technology could be the key to mainstream less invasive and port access CABG procedures on the beating heart. The S micro-stapler has the promise to be such a technology, provided that the favorable preclinical results are validated in humans.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Functional genetic screens as tools to discover signaling pathways targeted by cancer drugs'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['In chapter 1 we introduce various anti-cancer drugs and focus on histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs). Histone deacetylases are enzymes which catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from histones and other proteins, thereby regulating gene activity and protein function and activity. Several HDACI are currently tested in clinical trials, but their mechanisms of action are poorly understood. Chapter 2 describes a functional genetic screen which was conducted to gain insight into the mechanisms of action of HDACI. We introduced a cDNA library into transformed murine cells and selected the cells for resistance to the HDACI PXD101. Overexpression of the genes encoding for retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARa) and PRAME made the cells resistant to treatment with PXD101 and other HDACI. RARa is a nuclear hormone receptor which activates gene transcription upon binding of its ligand retinoic acid (RA). Treatment of cells with HDACIs activated RA signaling, but ectopic RARa and PRAME repressed RA signaling. Conversely, cells without RARs and cells with RNA interference (RNAi) to PRAME were hypersensitive to HDACIs. Melanoma tumors with knockdown of PRAME were sensitized to treatment with RA, HDACI, or both. Treatment of cells with HDACI and RA together synergistically activated RA signaling. These results indicate a role for RA signaling in HDACI-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Chapter 3 contains a detailed analysis of the human tumor antigen PReferentially expressed Antigen of MElanoma (PRAME). PRAME bound to RARa and repressed RA signaling, resulting in inhibition of physiological responses triggered by RA, such as growth arrest, differentiation and apoptosis. PRAME itself acted as a transcriptional repressor. PRAME bound the polycomb group protein EZH2, which is known as a silencer of gene expression by histone methylation. Melanoma cells contain high levels of PRAME protein and are resistant to RA, but could be rendered responsive to RA by knockdown of PRAME using RNAi. Similarly, melanoma tumors with PRAME knockdown were sensitive to RA treatment. In chapter 4, a third gene is described that was identified in the genetic screen from chapter 2. The protein encoded by this gene, UNC45A (SMAP-1), inhibited RA signaling induced by HDACI and by RA and acted as a transcriptional repressor. UNC45A also attenuated ligand-induced transactivation by progesterone receptor and PPAR receptors. UNC45A bound to RARa and RXRa and inhibited growth arrest and differentiation by RA. Chapter 5 describes a functional genetic screen with the HDACI SAHA using an RNAi library. Knockdown of HR23B rendered cells resistant to apoptosis induced by SAHA. HR23B is known to shuttle ubiquitylated proteins to the proteasome for degradation. SAHA was found to inhibit proteasome activity. SAHA and proteasome inhibitors induced HR23B protein levels and triggered apoptosis, which was prevented by knockdown of HR23B. SAHA has been approved for the treatment of advanced cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) and CTCL biopsies were found to contain high levels of HR23B protein. In Chapter 6, we have investigated the PRAME expression levels in breast cancer. PRAME expression was a prognostic marker for poor clinical outcome, as it was associated with shortened metastasis-free and overall survival. Chapter 7 reviews the current literature on PRAME expression and function in cancer. PRAME is expressed in a variety of human cancers, including melanomas, breast cancers, lung cancers, brain tumors and leukemias and in a limited number of normal tissues. It is not known if PRAME plays the same role in all cancers in which it is expressed. Finally, chapter 8 is a general discussion of the new findings presented in this thesis. We also describe data on bexarotene, an RXR-selective drug that is approved for treatment of CTCL. Cotreatment of cells with bexarotene and HDACI induced RA signaling in a synergistic manner and induced CTCL cell death in an additive manner. HDACI induced a downregulation of RXRa protein levels in CTCL cells, which was associated with apoptosis. These observations are consistent with the findings in our genetic screen from chapter 2. Together, we have shown that functional genetic screening can be used as an approach to gain new insights in the pathways that are targeted by clinically relevant compounds.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Immunodominant glycoproteins of the bovine lungworm Dictyocaulus viviparus'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['ackground: Dictyocaulus viviparus is a parasitic nematode causing bronchitis in cattle worldwide. In general, infections do not cause high mortality, but the morbidity can be high with concomitant loss of production. Parasitic nematode infections are treated in general with anthelmintic drugs, but resistance against these drugs is widespread and still increasing. Because calves infected with lungworm eventually develop a protective immune response, a vaccine will be more efficient to prevent disease. D. viviparus is the only nematode for which there is a commercial vaccine available, but this vaccine, consisting of infective larvae attenuated by radiation, has important drawbacks like limited shelf-life and the inability to induce immunological memory. A defined, animal friendly produced vaccine lacking these limitations is therefore in demand. Because passive immunisation proved that antibodies can harness protection, we analysed the antibody responses after infection and vaccination against several antigen extracts in order to identify candidates for a defined synthetic/recombinant vaccine. Results: Excretory/secretory (ES) products of adult worms contain glycoproteins and are well recognized by all immunogloblin isotypes present in sera of infected and vaccinated calves. The glycoproteins only contain N-linked glycans and the immunodominant part resides on the glycan. Booster responses were observed only after re-infection, not after vaccination, and these booster responses were directed against the protein backbone. IgG1 and IgE are the only isotypes that were boosted, suggesting that these isotypes are components of protective memory response after re-infection. The most immunodominant protein is a high molecular glycoprotein (GP300). This antigen is well recognized by IgG1 and IgE. Characterization of GP300 demonstrated that N-glycans of GP300 bind to the lectin wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) and are substituted with phosphorylcholine (PC). Both properties depend on the presence of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) on the antenna of the N-glycan. Within D. viviparus this was unique for GP300. PC was the immunodominant epitope of GP300 and antibodies against GP300 cross-react with the pro-inflammatory mediator platelet-activating factor (PAF) via the PC moiety. Analysis by mass spectrometry identified GP300 as the homologue of thrombospondin from Haemonchus contortus. H. contortus thrombospondine is a component of an experimental, partly protective vaccine. The finding that thrombospondin-like proteins contain PC-substituted glycans is novel for D. viviparus, H. contortus and other nematodes. Conclusions: The most immunogenic antigen of D. viviparus is the PC-containing glycoprotein GP300. IgE titers directed against GP300 correlates with protection, while PC-specific IgG cross-react with PAF from the host. The immunising potential of GP300 has to be evaluated in a vaccination trial with deglycosylated and untreated GP300. Challenge infection will demonstrate whether there is (IgE mediated) protection or not. Inflammation parameters (eosinophilia, respiration frequency), but also possibly protective responses (IgG2) can be downregulated by anti-PAF antibodies in the case of vaccination with the untreated GP300. In that case, a vaccine containing GP300 will reduce disease, but not the number of worms. Because PC has many other immunomodulatory properties and GP300 homologues with PC substitutions are also present in other nematodes, GP300 is an interesting and important antigen in nematode-immunology.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Targeting inflammation with autoantigen-specific T cells.'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Chronic autoimmune diseases are driven by cells that respond to tissue components of the body. Inflammation in diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes or multiple sclerosis, can be suppressed by drug therapy. However, the broad range of immunosuppressive action of these drugs often does not restrict to the autoimmune response, but increases the risk of serious infection. Therefore, therapies that restrict to suppression of only the auto-immune response need to be developed. CD4+ T cells that recognize cartilage are responsible for induction of arthritis because they direct their actions to cartilage in the joints. Such T cells are present in the joints of arthritis patients. Therefore, we hypothesized that T cells specific for the cartilage-derived antigen proteoglycan can be used to target arthritis with suppressive agents after introduction of genes that express suppressive agents in these T cells. For our studies we used cartilage proteoglycan-induced arthritis, which is a chronic arthritis in mice. This arthritis represents many features of rheumatoid arthritis, and is mediated by Th1 cells, B cells and antibodies. To enable studies on cartilage-specific T cells, we generated a transgenic mouse expressing a proteoglycan-specific T cell receptor on its T cells. Due to the high number of cartilage-specific T cells, transgenic mice were highly susceptible for arthritis. Moreover, the T cell response of transgenic mice with arthritis shifted to an excessive Th1-phenotype. Therefore, these transgenic mice were useful donors for arthritogenic CD4+ T cells. To explore gene therapy of inflammation with T cells, we provided proteoglycan-specific T cells with different genes encoding immunosuppressive proteins. The genes were isolated from mouse cells and inserted into T cells by retroviruses. Retroviral transduction of T cells resulted in up to 80% of cells expressing the transgenes (IL-4, IL-10, TNF-alpha-Receptor-Ig, IL-1 receptor antagonist). T cells expressing the inserted genes were sorted by flow cytometry and transferred to mice with arthritis. Especially T cells that were manipulated to express IL-10 were able to induce significant suppression of joint inflammation. Moreover, only the IL-10-producing T cells that expressed the cartilage-specific T cell receptor suppressed arthritis, indicating specificity of therapy. In addition, manipulated T cells suppressed production of pro-inflammatory proteins like TNF-alpha, IL-17, IL-2 and PG-specific IgG2a antibodies. Strikingly, we discovered that propagation of IL-10 production in cells of the treated recipient was the mechanism that was used by the transferred IL-10-producing T cells to suppress arthritis. Among the recipient’s cells, T cells and B cells were found to express increased levels of IL-10. Because interleukin-10 is an immunomodulatory cytokine expressed by cells in order to naturally prevent exacerbation of inflammation in healthy individuals, these results indicate that T cells producing IL-10 restore natural immunosuppressive immune responses in arthritis. In conclusion, manipulation of pro-inflammatory T cells that recognize tissue components is a powerful approach to specifically target inflammation in chronic autoimmune diseases. In addition, moving focus from suppression of pro-inflammatory mediators to propagation of immunosuppressive functions of cells may provide a more comprehensive insight in mechanisms that support specific regulatory capacities of the immune system.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Severe brain injury can result in long lasting loss of consciousness. After recovering from a comatose state, some patients move over into a vegetative state that remains for weeks, months or even years. The presence of patients in a prolonged unconscious state is demanding for families, as well as for all professionals who are involved in the treatment and care of these patients. In 1987, this was encountered by the therapists in a small (paediatric) rehabilitation centre. This resulted in the development of a treatment programme, the Early Intensive Neurorehabilitation programme (EINP). Eventually, the need for a systematically evaluation of EINP resulted in a comprehensive research programme. The question is whether recovery processes emerge in patients in a long lasting vegetative state or in minimally conscious state. And if so, questions arise whether treatments have positive effects and what the long-term functional outcome of these patients will be. In this thesis, three topics have been elaborated. Firstly, the focus was on the concept of the different levels of consciousness, including the development of an observation scale: the Post-Acute Level of Consciousness scale (PALOC-s). This scale appeared to be highly reliable and valid and provides clinicians and researchers the possibility to distinguish between different levels of unconsciousness, what can contribute positively to the diagnosis, the prognosis and the treatment of these patients Secondly, the development of the level of consciousness of the children and young adults who participated in EINP was studied. The results indicate a positive effect of EINP on the recovery to consciousness. These results are sufficient to recommend the application of EINP for all patients in VS or MCS, as soon as possible after emerging from the comatose state Thirdly, the long-term outcome, social participation and quality of life of the patients, and the involvement and used coping strategies of family members were studied. The experienced quality of life by the patients appeared to be quite high, despite the fact that most of them encountered long-term consequences. Furthermore, the conclusion could be drawn that it is important to avoid a passive coping style in relatives to avoid anegative impact on the experienced long-term quality of life of the patients. This research project was originated during the development of EINP in 1987. From the start, it was recognized that evaluation of the recovery processes was important. Nevertheless, it appeared to be very difficult to develop a valid and reliable research design within the clinical context of the small (paediatric) rehabilitation centre. Now, 20 years later, it can be concluded that all the efforts of so many at last are successful. Based on this research project, recently EINP has been recognized as a valid rehabilitation technique for patients in VS and MCS. Twenty years ago, nobody could have thought that this would be the result of the development of one single treatment programme for one single five-year old girl.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Cardiac recovery by stem and progenitor cells'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['The adult human heart has a minimal ability to regenerate myocardium. Therefore, loss of viable cardiomyocytes in cardiac disease, such as myocardial infarction (MI), may lead to heart failure. After evaluating the regenerative potential of several stem cell sources of cardiac myocytes and vascular cells (chapter 2), we created a mouse model of MI and cell transplantation which allows long term phenotypical analysis of engrafted human stem and progenitor cells, and used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to monitor cardiac function (chapter 3). We thus performed the first long term study of human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CM) in uninjured and infarcted mouse hearts, and found that hESC-CM survive, integrate and mature in the host myocardium for at least 12 weeks. HESC-CM transplantation improved heart function post-MI at 4 weeks compared to differentiated hESCs devoid of cardiomyocytes, but this was not sustained at 12 weeks (chapter 4). Comparing the effects of injection of hESC-CM at different dosages with hESC-non-CM derivatives, culture medium or no injection in the same experimental model, we demonstrate that both hESC-CM and hESC-non-CM provide long term functional improvement compared to vehicle- or no injection even though only cardiomyocytes formed persistent grafts. Importantly, increasing numbers of hESC-CM for transplantation resulted in no additional functional benefit. In addition, we confirmed evidence of a paracrine contribution of the transplanted hESC-CM by demonstrating increased vascularization in the infarcted heart associated specifically with transplantation of these cells (chapter 5). Because the grafted cells were usually surrounded by a fibrotic layer, we determined its composition with respect to extracellular matrix type and origin, and found a contribution of both host and donor cells. In addition, we characterized the integrin expression of hESC-CM in vitro and at various time points post-transplantation. Co-transplanted hESC-derived endothelial cells formed a capillary network through the fibrotic layer that communicated with the mouse vasculature, supporting extended graft survival and maturation over a 6 month period (chapter 6). We further specified the role and suitability of vasculogenic cells in cardiac regeneration using mice and human cells with a deficiency of endoglin, an accessory TGFbeta-receptor present on mononuclear cells (MNCs). Defects in mutant mice in vascularization and cardiac function post-MI could be rescued by intravenous injection of healthy donor MNCs, but not MNCs from patients with the gene mutation. This indicates that cardiovascular patients, who often have defects in their MNCs and endothelial progenitor cells, may benefit from transplantation of cells with high endoglin expression, and matched heterologous cells may be preferred (chapter 7). Finally, we show that human heart-derived cardiomyocyte progenitor cells (CMPCs) and CMPC-CM prevented cardiac dilatation and deterioration of cardiac function for at least 12 weeks after MI. In addition, CMPCs differentiated in vivo into cardiomyocytes, smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells (chapter 8). In conclusion, several cell types improve cardiac function but some problems need to be solved, and further investigation into the underlying mechanisms is required for optimization in the choice of cell number and type so that clinical strategies can be properly defined.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Vascular endothelial cells form the inner lining of the vessel wall and thereby help maintaining the structural integrity of the blood vessel. In addition, the endothelium provides the surface for and actively participates in the mediation of inflammatory responses and in the arrest of bleeding in the event of vascular damage. Endothelial cells also take part in these processes by releasing the content of their unique, cigar-shaped organelles called Weibel-Palade bodies (WPBs). These organelles function as storage vesicles for von Willebrand factor (VWF), a multimeric adhesive glycoprotein crucial for platelet plug formation, the leukocyte receptor P-selectin and a number of bioactive compounds that include the chemokines interleukin-8 (IL-8) and eotaxin-3. To adequately respond to events like vascular trauma, endothelial cells are equipped with a complex signaling machinery that can regulate exocytosis of WPBs in response to cellular activation. The studies performed in this thesis are aimed at gaining a better understanding of the two processes that are fundamental to this capability of the endothelium, namely sorting of secretory proteins to WPBs and regulated secretion through exocytosis of WPBs. To gain more insight in how endothelial cells modulate the content of their WPBs, we have investigated a possible chaperone function for VWF by which it governs entry of other constituents into the storage pathway. Furthermore, this thesis aims to unravel signaling cascades and identify cellular components that control the exocytosis of WPBs in response to activation of the endothelial cell. In chapter 2, we have studied the entry of the chemokine IL-8 into the storage pathway of the endothelial cell in a quantitative manner. We have made the interesting observation that the molar amounts of IL-8 and VWF that enter WPBs are intimately linked. We postulate that this is due to a molecular interaction between these proteins in the acidic environment of the late secretory pathway. In chapter 3 we have found that the guanine exchange factor RalGDS regulates the release of WPBs in response to agonists that are mediated by the second messenger Ca2+. Through its interaction with the Ca2+ sensor CaM, RalGDS activates the small GTPase Ral in thrombin-stimulated endothelial cells, which results in the exocytosis of WPBs. Chapter 4 describes a novel PKA-independent pathway through which endothelial cells regulate cAMP-mediated exocytosis of WPB. This depends on the activation of the GTPase Rap1 by the cAMP-GEF Epac. In chapter 5 we have found that WPBs in endothelial cells that mimic a phenotype induced by shear stress display less clustering at the MTOC in response to stimulation with agonists that raise intracellular cAMP. Finally, in chapter 6 of this thesis our findings are summarized and we discuss them in the context of reports by others. A more general view is provided on the targeting of bioactive compounds to WPBs and regulatory mechanisms that exist in the endothelium to control release of these vesicles. Also, directions for future study are indicated.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['We assessed the association between long-term exposure to air pollution and cause-specific mortality and lung cancer incidence using data from an ongoing cohort study: the Netherlands Cohort Study on Diet and Cancer (NLCS). The NLCS study was initiated in September 1986 with the enrollment of 120,852 subjects aged 55-69 years living in 204 municipalities located throughout the Netherlands. Long-term exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO2), black smoke (BS), fine particles less than 2.5 ?m (PM2.5) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) was estimated. Exposure at each home address was considered as a function of a regional, an urban and a local component. The regional component was estimated using inverse distance weighed interpolation of measurement data from regional background sites in the national monitoring network. The urban component was estimated using regression models with urban concentrations as dependent variables, and number of inhabitants in different buffers and land use variables, derived with a Geographic Information System (GIS), as predictor variables. The local component was assessed using a GIS and a digital road network with linked traffic intensities. Traffic intensity on the nearest road and the total traffic intensity in a 100 m buffer around each home address were assessed. The methods that were developed explained a relatively large percentage of the spatial variance of the air pollution components. Air pollution and several traffic exposure variables were associated with mortality, but the relative risks were generally small. Statistically significant associations between NO2 and black smoke exposure and natural cause and respiratory mortality were found. The highest relative risks were found for respiratory mortality. We found suggestive evidence for larger effects of black smoke exposure in those with low education and in those with low fruit consumption. We found no association between air pollution concentrations, traffic variables and lung cancer incidence in the full study population. In never smokers, associations between black smoke concentrations and traffic variables with lung cancer incidence were (borderline) significant, however. This is the first time that the effects of air pollution, traffic intensity and traffic noise on cardiovascular mortality have been studied together. We observed an association between traffic intensity on the nearest road and overall cardiovascular mortality, which was driven by an association with ischemic heart disease mortality. Relative risks for background black smoke concentrations were elevated for cerebrovascular and heart failure mortality. These associations were not affected by adjustment for traffic noise. There was an indication of an effect of traffic noise in the highest noise exposure category (> 65 dB(A)), which was largely restricted to heart failure mortality. The relative risk for the association between ischemic heart disease mortality and high traffic noise was reduced to unity after adjustment for background black smoke concentrations and traffic intensity. The associations between traffic intensity on the nearest road with overall cardiovascular mortality and ischemic heart disease mortality were not explained by traffic noise. Overall, the results provide evidence that exposure to background and to traffic-related air pollution increases the risk of cardiovascular, respiratory and lung cancer mortality.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Ever since the first PM implantation in The Netherlands on january the 30th 1962 by cardiologist Dr Blom, Leiden University, there has been an almost continuous yearly increase of the numbers op PMs implanted in The Netherlands. In 2006 in the Netherlands, 9765 PM’s were implanted of which 6765 were first implants. The remaining included pacemaker replacements. In 2006, a total of 12853 leads were implanted of which 11819 were used as first implantations. A pacemaker implantation is now considered a routine procedure. Pacing therapy, however, does not end after implantation. Patients with an implanted pacing device enter a lifelong path of follow-up. The FOLLOWPACE study was designed as a nation-wide prospective cohort study among patients who received a PM for the first time executed among 24 pacemaker centers in The Netherlands. The incidence of in-hospital events after first PM implantation was 10.1 % (95 %CI: 8.9 %-12.3 %). Six variables i.e. a lower body mass index, presence of heart failure in medical history, main indication for implantation, vena subclavia use for venous access, passive atrial lead fixation, and the implantation of a dual chamber system were found to be independent predictors of these in-hospital events. We disclosed that, in general, crucial PM parameters are regularly checked and much attention is paid to the safety of cardiac pacing throughout the follow-up. Pacing stimulation and sensing thresholds as well as lead impedances and percentages of pacing remain stable over time but these values depend on the lead location, lead fixation, and pulse duration. Reprogramming of PM parameters declined during the first year after PM implantation. The majority of PM controls was carried out by a PM technician, indicating the influence of the allied professional on the quality and safety of chronic cardiac pacing. The Health related Quality of Life (HRQoL) measured just before first PM implantation was significantly lower than that of a general population. Gender, age and the presence of cardiovascular co-morbidities are clearly related to the quality of life before PM implantation. We found that the HRQoL of patients treated with a pacemaker for conventional indications improved considerably in the first year after implantation. Almost 70 % of patients considered their HRQoL much better or even completely recovered. We found that patients with extreme low or high BMI and patients with concomitant heart failure and other cardiovascular diseases were more likely to experience an events after PM implantation. Having had an in-hospital event further increased the risk for developing a PM therapy related event as well as a major non-fatal cardiac event (but not all cause mortality). Using the Vena subclavia as access point for cardiac entrance also increased the risk of a PM therapy related event.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['A robotic device for MRI-guided prostate brachytherapy'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['One of the treatment options for prostate cancer is brachytherapy with iodine-125 sources. In prostate brachytherapy a high radiation dose is delivered to the prostate with a steep dose fall off to critical surrounding organs. The implantation of the iodine sources is currently performed under ultrasound guidance, but MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) offers a better image quality that could be employed to further improve source placement precision and prostate dose distribution. Due to the limited amount of space inside a closed bore MRI scanner the currently used manual implantation technique is impossible. Therefore a robotic device, which can be placed between the patient’s legs, is being developed. Prostate motion is one of the main causes of seed misplacement. Because this motion is more or less random there is no practical solution to take it into account during planning of the treatment (chapter 2). To diminish prostate motion a new needle insertion method was developed. Instead of pushing the needle into the prostate, the needle is tapped into the prostate with a high velocity. A tapping device was built and tested on a piece a beef (chapter 3). The tests showed less beef motion with higher needle insertion velocities. After the phantom experiments a clinical study was performed to compare prostate motion during needle insertion for pushing and tapping the needle into the prostate (chapter 4). The mean prostate motion was 5.6~mm when the needle was pushed and 0.9 mm when the needle was tapped into the prostate. We expect that prostate movement will be further reduced when the tapping device is operated at higher momentums. To be able to deliver the iodine seeds at the pre-planned position a good image of the prostate, the needle and the seeds is necessary. The only currently available commercial MRI compatible needles are made of titanium, which still gives a rather large artefact at the tip. This makes it difficult to determine the exact position of the delivered seeds (dimensions 4.5 x 0.8 mm), which is of importance for accurate dose delivery in the prostate. In chapter 5 a simulation study was performed to investigate the influence of different needle materials on the seed artefact. Only with a plastic needle it was possible to distinguish the seed artefact. When the middle of the seed position is taken as the middle of the seed artefact, the seed position can be determined with an accuracy of 0.4 mm on Gradient Echo images. In chapter 6 the first prototype of the MRI compatible robotic device is described. MRI compatibility tests proved the working of the robotic device in a magnetic field without distorting the MR images. In the near future pre-clinical experiments will be performed to test the functionality and the needle and seed placement accuracy of the robotic device. Thanks to the new needle insertion method and the MRI-guidance we think that more accurate seed placement and therefore a better dose distribution is possible than currently achieved.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Respiratory viral infections and interaction with bacteria in children with cystic fibrosis'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the most common lethal autosomal recessive disorders in the Caucasian population. Mutations of the cystic fibrosis transregulator membrane gene cause the body to produce thick, sticky mucus. In the lungs this results in obstruction of the airways associated with chronic inflammation, bacterial colonization and recurrent infections of the lungs, which finally leads to irreversible damage and early death . Aggressive treatment of bacterial infections has been one of the most important factors in dramatic improvement of life expectancy in patients with CF. Further improvement of survival in CF might be achieved by focusing on other sources of respiratory infections, such as viruses. Viruses are known to play an important role in the morbidity of other chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In addition, it is suggested that viral infection might facilitate bacterial infections. Until now, the role of respiratory viral infections and its interaction with bacteria in CF was elucidated only partially. We speculated that respiratory viruses can play an important role in CF lung disease. Although the exposure to viruses is equal in CF patients and controls, the impact of respiratory viruses, even of “common colds”, on clinical symptoms is in CF patients far beyond the virus-related morbidity in healthy controls. We add detailed data that children with CF have prolonged and more severe episodes of lower respiratory tract complaints. Mainly patient-related factors seem to explain the higher susceptibility for respiratory viral infections. New clinical evidence is presented that rhinovirus is detected more frequently and for longer periods in patients with CF. We suggest that a higher viral replication due to an impaired anti-viral defense causes increased viral loads in CF patients. Furthermore, we demonstrate virus-associated bacterial colonization in CF. Virus-related respiratory illnesses are frequently associated with P. aeruginosa acquisition in both children with CF and healthy controls, but lead to persistent infection only in CF. Increased binding of bacteria under influence of viral infection could be one of the mechanisms explaining this phenomenon. We describe that P. aeruginosa binding to epithelial cells is strongly enhanced by RSV infection. In addition, RSV possibly acts as a coupling agent between bacteria and cells and the increased binding can be effectively blocked by heparin. This thesis shows that respiratory viruses play indeed an important role in CF lung disease, either directly or through interaction with bacteria. It adds new data to limited earlier findings concerning the role of respiratory viral infections in CF. Our findings might have important clinical implications. New data in this thesis indicate that it is feasible to detect P. aeruginosa colonization by oropharyngeal cultures at home. This might be helpful in early detection of new bacterial colonization, for example in preventing chronic colonization. Current treatment strategies of pulmonary symptoms in CF are mainly aimed at treating bacterial infections with antibiotics and sputum evacuation. Our results which underline the importance of respiratory viral infections might suggest new therapeutic strategies to further improve prognosis of patients with CF.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Brain atrophy is often observed on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the elderly. This is of clinical importance since the extent and rate of progression of brain atrophy are associated with future cognitive deterioration and conversion to Alzheimer’s dementia. The overall aim of this thesis was to gain further insight in the contribution of vascular pathology and cerebral hypoperfusion to the development of brain atrophy and cognitive decline. First, we estimated brain volumes and cerebrovascular lesions on MRI in a large cohort of patients with arterial disease. The decrease in total brain volume and cortical gray matter volume with age was comparable with findings from the general population. However, white matter lesions, silent brain infarcts, and subcortical brain atrophy, were more common in patients with arterial disease. Next, we investigated whether white matter lesions and lacunar infarcts were associated with brain atrophy and cognitive impairment. We found that white matter lesions were associated with more global, subcortical and cortical brain atrophy, whereas lacunar infarcts were associated with more global and subcortical atrophy. Furthermore, we found that white matter lesions and lacunar infarcts were both associated with worse executive functioning independently of brain atrophy. White matter lesions and lacunar infarcts were not associated with worse memory. Finally, we investigated the associations between cerebral blood flow, brain atrophy and cognitive functioning. We found that a lower cerebral blood flow was associated with more subcortical brain atrophy, but only in patients with moderate to severe white matter lesions. We also found that lower cerebral blood flow was associated with worse executive performance. The association between lower cerebral blood flow and worse performance on executive functioning also became stronger with increasing volumes of white matter lesions. The studies described in this thesis showed that white matter lesions, lacunar infarcts, and subcortical brain atrophy were highly prevalent in our study population. White matter lesions seem to contribute to the development of brain atrophy, but they also appear to be an independent risk factor for impairment in executive functioning. Furthermore, white matter lesions may make persons more vulnerable to the devastating effects of cerebral hypoperfusion. The finding of a high prevalence of subcortical vascular pathology suggests that patients with arterial disease may be at increased risk of developing subcortical ischemic vascular dementia. Global and cortical brain atrophy appeared to be a less prominent feature of our population. We speculate that subcortical ischemic vascular disease is a contributing factor in the pathogenesis of cognitive decline and dementia at a stage before brain atrophy contributes to this process. This suggests that treatment of vascular risk factors may prevent or slow down the development of brain atrophy and cognitive decline.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The liver has the unique capacity to regulate its mass after loss of functional liver cells due to liver disease, injury, and/or toxicity. Unfortunately, in the course of chronic liver disease this meticulously regulated regeneration process is imbalanced resulting in a decreased regenerative capacity. Like in humans, most liver diseases in dogs are chronic and occur through persistent inflammation due to different causes. On-going liver cell damage leads to a reduction of the functional liver cell mass and progressive deposition of fibrous tissue in the liver. We found that regenerative and fibrotic molecular pathways of canine cirrhosis resembled those in human liver samples with cirrhosis, reinforcing the current paradigm of a highly comparable pathophysiology of human and canine hepatic disease. Dogs with liver diseases are therefore relevant animal models for the evaluation of novel therapeutic approaches, such as the stimulation of different cell types (mature or immature) to participate in the regeneration process by growth factor therapy. In the present thesis, two options of approach are proposed; (1) the use of Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF) and (2) liver progenitor cell-based therapies. (1) HGF is the principal factor for stimulating the liver to grow and regenerate and suppress fibrosis and apoptosis. Therefore, recombinant HGF was produced and tested for its biological activity. The first clinical trial with recombinant HGF was initiated in dogs with a congenital portosystemic shunt (CPSS). (2) When the proliferation of mature liver cells is inhibited, the proliferation and differentiation (activation) of normally quiescent liver progenitor cells (LPC) are observed. LPC activation has recently been demonstrated in spontaneous canine and human liver diseases and has opened a new field of research in regenerative medicine. A tool to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms and regulatory events leading to LPC activation is provided by culturing these cells in vitro. However, purification of LPCs is complicated due to their scarce number in healthy livers and the lack of specific LPC markers. We described two techniques to isolate and culture LPCs from healthy mature dog livers. These cells were characterized at a molecular level and may be ideally suited for future cell therapies. In conclusion, the results in the present thesis can be mutually beneficial for canine and human biomedical research and provide possible novel means of therapy for liver disease. The research was conducted at the Department of Clinical Sciences of Companion Animals (Faculty Core Programme Tissue Repair and the University Focus Point Growth and Differentiation. Collaborations include Departments of Pathobiology (Prof. De Bruin) and Biochemistry & Cell Biology (Prof. Helms). Collaborations outside the faculty include the Departments of Molecular Pathology (Prof. Roskams) and Molecular Cell Biology (Dr. Vankelecom), University Hospitals of Leuven (Belgium), Zenoaq (Japan), and Intervet B.V.

       "  'Description': ['Throughout the human genome millions of places exist where humans differ gentically. The aim of this PhD thesis was to systematically assess this genetic variation and its biological consequences in a genome-wide way, through the utilization of DNA oligonucleotide arrays that assess hundres of thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We describe a new statistical method that can detects very small copy number variations (CNVs). When applying this method to Illumina HumanHap550 oligonucleotide arrays that assay over 550,000 SNPs, approximately 99 deletions per individual were identified. We assessed the molecular biological consequences of genetic variation on gene expression through a combined genetical-genomics approach in 110 unrelated coeliac disease individuals. This study resulted in the identification of over 1,000 common genetic variants that affect gene expression. These include SNPs that affect the expression of IL18RAP and CCR2 and which were recently shown to be associated with coeliac disease. Additionally we identified several genes, in which certain genetic variants switch between different splice variants. We describe a novel method that uses a reconstructed functional human gene network to prioritize positional candidate genes within susceptibility loci, that either have been detected through linkage or (genome-wide) association studies. We describe a new method to study diseases for which the genetic basis is still mostly unclear, but for which there is evidence that patients often have deletions or duplications. We hypothesized that these mutations are likely to affect the function of the genes within these deletions or duplications. Since multiple genes usually map within these loci, it can be assumed that multiple biological processes are affected. We tested this hypothesis in previously identified susceptibility loci in autism. We determined which clinical symptoms could be caused by mutations within these genes for each loci per gene. We then assessed whether certain symptoms could be caused by mutations in more loci than expected. Various symptoms known to co-occur with autism were identified, such as craniofacial abnormalities and epilepsy. As such, these findings substantiate our hypothesis. A genome-wide association study was conducted in coeliac disease. By developing a new statistical method to assign genotypes to these samples, we were able to identify a new susceptibility locus that contains IL2 and IL21. These interleukins play an important role in the immune response which is characteristic for untreated celiac disease patients. Another genome-wide association study identified a new susceptibility locus in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis that contains DPP6, a gene that affects the biological activity of neuropeptides. These findings indicate that genome-wide approaches can help to gain insight in both fundamental aspects of the human genome and its effect on complex diseases.'],\n",

       "  'Description': [\"This thesis addresses decision analysis, cost-effectiveness models and the analysis of heterogeneity, applied to intracranial aneurysms and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Subarachnoid hemorrhage is a subset of stroke that usually occurs at relatively young age and has poor prognosis. Although, the risk of SAH can be reduced by screening for and preventive treatment of unruptured aneurysms, these strategies are not without risk to the patient. Regional variation of SAH incidence rates in Sweden was assessed using hospital admission data on 18,443 patients with SAH in 1987-2002. The incidence of SAH increased with age, was higher for women than for men, and higher in the north than in the south. The 28-day case fatality rate increased with age up to 80 years, and then leveled off. Both the SAH incidence and case fatality rates decreased over time. The cost-effectiveness of screening patients who survived an episode of SAH for new intracranial aneurysms was analyzed. In general, screening cannot be recommended, since it is not beneficial. However, screening was cost-effective in patients with an at least 4.5 times increased risk of both aneurysm formation and rupture. The cost-effectiveness of different treatment strategies for elderly patients with SAH was analyzed. Aneurysm treatment was more costly than conservative treatment, without providing additional health benefits, in patients admitted in poor condition more than ten days after SAH, and patients older than 80 years, admitted in poor condition more than four days after SAH. Cost-effectiveness was acceptable only for women aged 70-79 years, and men aged 70-74 years, admitted in good condition within four days. Occlusion of ruptured intracranial aneurysms instead of conservative treatment improves outcome in some elderly patients, but not in all, and costs will often be unacceptably high. The hypothesis of a constant, annual growth rate for all intracranial aneurysms was assessed in a simulation study and qualified as improbable. The actual growth process is probably irregular and discontinuous, consisting of periods with and without growth. Ignoring the effect of variation in disease progression within individuals over time in cost-effectiveness models will cause the benefits of screening strategies to be overrated. Survival datasets were simulated and unobserved heterogeneity (frailty) was added to determine the practical implications of using standard survival models instead of frailty models, in the presence of frailty. Standard models did not perform worse than frailty models in prediction tests. Ignoring frailty and the small degree of bias it may introduce in regression coefficients of covariates and survival parameters will have little practical implications in most settings. An extension of value-of-information methods concerning the expected value of perfect information (EVPI) is presented. The EVPI conceals separate contributions of underlying uncertainty in costs and effects to the expected monetary loss caused by all uncertainty combined. The EVPI is dissected in terms of its underlying cost and effect outcomes. It is demonstrated that for any EVPI there is an (infinite) range of decision problems with identical EVPIs differing only in terms of their contributions of expected costs and effects, the 'attributable EVPIs'.\"],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Despite advances in surgical and anesthesia techniques, subtle neurologic injury still remains an important complication after cardiac surgery. Because the causes are multifactorial and complex, research in an appropriate small animal model for cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is warranted. This thesis describes several applications and adaptations of a rat model of cardiopulmonary bypass, all aimed to improve perioperative outcomes. First an appropriately sized oxygenator was implemented in the model. We then subjected old rats and diabetic rats to 90 min of CPB, and found that if CPB causes cognitive deficits, these are only subtle. Further, we investigated whether different temperature strategies would improve outcome. We concluded that mild hypothermia during CPB and continued into the postoperative period may have a beneficial effect. In the model we also tested a RNA molecule (aptamer) that inhibits Factor IX and thus is a very effective anticoagulant and a possible replacement for heparin. Anticoagulation during CPB and reversal with the aptamer were non-inferior compared to heparin, but 3 hr postoperative cardiac function was improved in the aptamer group when compared to the heparin/protamine group. Because hypoperfusion is thought to contribute to the observed deficits in humans, we tested an artificial oxygen carrier, able to dissolve large quantities of oxygen and deliver it in the microvasculature, in our rat CPB model. Administration of the oxygen carrier led to increased inflammation an mortality in the experimental group. In addition, we adapted the model to better mimic specific clinical situations and related research questions. We improved the model by induction of cardioplegic cardiac arrest while on CPB. Due to the closed-chest approach, survivability is warranted and longterm functional (ultrasound), enzymatic or histological outcomes can be assessed. To mimic embolic showers as can occur during cardiac surgery, we injected holmium microspheres. Due to the paramagnetic properties of holmium, the microspheres cause artifacts on MRI and can thus be easily located and quantified. We also changed the current delivery and injection technique and found the delivery reproducible in location and delivered load. We believe that the models described in this thesis will continue to help research aimed to improve perioperative outcomes.'],\n",

The research on blood-induced joint damage described in this thesis, contains studies on the mechanism of this arthropathy, possible treatments, translation of in vitro to animal in vivo situation and possible outcome measures in clinical practice in the treatment of haemophiliacs. Mechanism: Time and concentration dependency of blood-induced cartilage damage Exposure of human cartilage tissue to low concentrations of blood for a short period of time leads to prolonged cartilage damage. Susceptibility of degenerated cartilage Degenerated cartilage is as vulnerable to blood-induced damage as healthy cartilage is. Treatment: Poloxamer P188 The non-ionic surfactant poloxamer P188 does not prevent blood-induced cartilage damage. Interleukin-10 Interleukin-10 protects against blood-induced joint damage. Translation: Clearance rate of blood from the canine knee joint Very rapid clearance after a joint bleed in the canine knee can not prevent adverse effects on cartilage and synovial tissue. Exposure surface of cartilage Blood-induced cartilage damage in vitro: articular exposure versus total exposure. Clinical practice: Biomarkers as outcome measure of joint damage The combination of uCTX-II, sCOMP, and sCS846 reflects cartilage damage in haemophilic arthropathy. Digital scoring of radiographs to measure joint damage Digital scoring of haemophilic arthropathy using radiographs is feasible. Taken together, this thesis contains a variety of studies all aimed at the ultimate goal of research on blood-induced joint damage: the prevention of this arthropathy. More insight in the pathogenetic mechanism has been gained, possible treatment modalities have been explored, the in vitro and in vivo models of blood-induced joint damage have been further characterized and outcome measures as needed in clinical trials with possible treatment modalities have been investigated. All these results will be used in the continuation of this research.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Obesity-induced type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has grown to epidemic proportions in the last decades. The number of adults with T2DM in the United States has increased rapidly by almost 50% between 1991 and 2000 according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Furthermore, the World Health Organisation (WHO) predicts that the number of T2DM patiens worldwide will grow to as much as 300 million in the year 2025. T2DM is not characeterised by the lack of insulin production found for the much less common type 1 diabetes mellitus, but manifests itself by decreased sensitivity towards insulin. In both types of diabetes similar complications arise as a result of impaired insulin signalling and lack of response to increased glucose levels. Serious complications, mostly resulting from vascular problems, like kidney failure and blindness are often found in untreated diabetic patients. Both types of diabetes can be treated and, in the case of T2DM, this often involves administration of insulin sensitizing drugs. A commonly used group of insulin sensitizers are the thiazolidinediones (TZDs). In 1995 it was found that TZDs function as ligands for the transcription factor PPAR\\uf067\\uf02c a member of the\\uf020 nuclear receptor superfamily and the TZDs rosiglitazone and pioglitazone are now well known compounds, both in clinical and experimental settings. The importance of the different chromatin remodelling complexes in adipogenesis and PPAR\\uf067\\uf020mediated gene expression has become evident from various studies. Ribozyme mediated decrease of the histone acetyltransferases CBP and p300 expression, inhibited PPAR\\uf067\\uf02dmediated gene expression and adipogenesis. In accordance with these findings CBP-deficient as well as heterozygous mice show a reduced fat mass due to undeveloped white adipose tissue. Furthermore expression of dominant negative BRG-1 or BRM, components of the ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling SWI/SNF complex, also decreased PPAR\\uf067 mediated gene activation. The main role of the TRAP complex, which is related to the yeast mediator proteins, lies in direct communication between the various coactivators and the general transcription complex. TRAP220 is an essential subunit of the TRAP complex, interacting with various nuclear receptors including PPAR\\uf067. By using TRAP220-/- fibroblasts it was shown that the TRAP complex plays an essential role in adipogenesis, acting as a PPAR\\uf067\\uf020mediator complex. These data underscore the important function of coactivator complexes in PPAR\\uf067 signalling and thereby regulation of energy metabolism. Therefore, further understanding of PPAR\\uf067 activity is important since novel PPAR\\uf067 modifiers could offer the possibility of therapeutic modulation and provide new ways of improving insulin sensitivity (see also chapter 2). Therefore, as described in this thesis, we set out to investigate the different levels at which coactivators function in PPAR\\uf0672 activation and also how mutant forms of PPAR\\uf067\\uf020are affected in their associations with coactivator proteins (chapter 3). In an effort to identify novel regulators of PPAR\\uf067 we have developed an immunoprecipitation assay coupled to mass spectrometry analysis (chapters 4 and 5) as well as a novel screening method based on PPAR\\uf0672 driven miRNA expression (chapter 6) for the use of high troughput siRNA library screens. Using these assays, several novel PPAR\\uf0672 interactors were identified.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Cross-sectional studies showed that depression and diabetes often co-occur. However, the reason for this is unclear. Depression may be a risk factor for diabetes or diabetes may be a risk factor for depression. The first aim of this thesis was to investigate these two associations. The second aim was to discuss several methodological issues to improve the conduct and reporting of etiologic research. We conducted a meta-analysis of nine longitudinal studies that investigated whether depression was a risk factor for type 2 diabetes, and showed that depressed adults had a 37% increased risk of developing diabetes compared with non-depressed subjects. Using a large pharmacy database, we showed that the risk of diabetes was not increased in users of antidepressants. Within diabetes patients, we showed that antidepressant use did not influence the amount of insulin used. We found that the prevalence of depressive symptoms was increased among patients who reported to be diagnosed with type 2 diabetes but not among patients with impaired fasting glucose or undiagnosed type 2 diabetes. Finally, we found that the incidence of antidepressant and benzodiazepine use was only increased shortly before and after the initiation of diabetes treatment. We created missing values in a confounder to assess the bias in the exposure-outcome association when using the missing indicator method, complete case analysis, and multiple imputation. We concluded that the missing indicator method should never be used to handle missing confounder data, that complete case analysis can only be used in rare situations, while multiple imputation gives unbiased effect estimates in most situations. We provided the methods to assist epidemiologists to estimate interaction on an additive scale between two continuous determinants using logistic regression analysis. We assessed how interaction was reported in 225 published cohort and case-control studies and found that only one in ten studies reported sufficient data to interpret interaction effects on an additive and multiplicative scale. We found a lower prevalence of depression among diabetes patients compared with patients without diabetes and showed that these unexpected findings could at least in part be explained by differential selection of subjects who visited their general practitioner for a control visit. Examination of 150 published case-control studies showed that, based on the method of selecting cases and controls, 57 studies required a stable population to estimate a rate ratio, 48 studies estimated a rate ratio without needing any assumption, and 16 studies estimated a risk ratio requiring the rare disease assumption. Based on the results of this thesis and previous studies, we cannot draw a firm conclusion on whether depression is a risk factor for diabetes, because the studies were too heterogeneous. There seems to be no increased risk of depression after a period of at least two years after the diagnosis of diabetes. There may be an increased risk of depression shortly after the diagnosis of diabetes. More knowledge on the point in time that the risk of depression may be increased after a diagnosis of diabetes, might direct specific monitoring of depression in diabetes patients.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The objective of this study was to find out whether the zebrafish can be an appropriate model for studying DNA repair and cancer. For this purpose three fish lines were used that lack components of an important mechanism for the repair of small DNA damage: DNA mismatch repair. These fish are therefore hereditary predisposed to develop cancer. Several mismatch repair enzymes also have a function in meiosis, the reduction cell division that is necessary for the formation of germ cells. Male zebrafish with mutations in the mismatch repair gene mlh1 were found to be sterile and to display an arrest in spermatogenesis at metaphase I. In contrast, female mutants are fully fertile, but their progeny shows high rates of dysmorphology and mortality within the first days of development, which was found to be caused by aneuploidy resulting from meiosis I chromosomal missegregation. Surprisingly, the small percentage of progeny that develops normally has a complete triploid genome, consisting of both sets of maternal and one set of paternal chromosomes. The three different fish families with defects in the mismatch repair genes mlh1, msh2 and msh6 were indeed found to be more sensitive to the development of cancer. They develop a range of tumour types at low frequencies. Predominantly neurofibromas were observed, indicating that zebrafish mimic distinct features of the human disease resulting from lack of mismatch repair, and are complementary to mouse models. The advantage of experimental accessibility of zebrafish was used in combination with an in vivo assay for mutation detection to study the in vivo effect of alkylation damage on lethality and mutation frequency in developing embryos. Consistent with the damage-sensing role of the MMR system, mutant embryos lacking the MMR enzyme MSH6 displayed lower lethality than wild types after exposure to ENU and MNU. In line with this, alkylation-induced somatic mutation frequencies were found to be much higher in wild type embryos than in the msh6 loss-of-function mutants. These mutations were found to be chromosomal aberrations, likely caused by chromosomal breaks that in turn result from stalled replication forks. Additionally, we found that mismatch repair deficiency does not improve ENU mutagenesis in the zebrafish germ line. Altogether, this indicates that the action of the mismatch repair system in zebrafish with regard to the formation of germ cells, the growth of tumours and the response to chemotherapeutic agents is similar to that in human and mouse. This means that the zebrafish can be considered a useful model. However, within all these areas there are clear differences, which are equally important as they enable us to study new aspects of cancer - research that is not possible in mouse and human.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Complete submergence is one of the most severe abiotic stresses worldwide, both in natural and man-made ecosystems. A limited number of species have evolved mechanisms to deal with these conditions. Rumex palustris, a model for studying plant responses to flooding, manages to outgrow the water, and thus restore contact with the atmosphere, through upward leaf growth (hyponasty) followed by strongly enhanced petiole elongation. These responses are initiated by the gaseous plant hormone ethylene, which accumulates inside plants due to physical entrapment and mimics largely this morphological submergence response. The complexity of ethylene-driven growth in R. palustris upon submergence suggests the involvement of many genes under tight regulation. A comprehensive understanding of the changes in the expression of genes responsive to ethylene is crucial to elucidate the signal transduction networks that lead to hyponastic growth and under-water elongation in this plant. By applying cDNA subtractive hybridisation and cDNA-AFLP (RNA fingerprinting) we identified 119 differentially expressed genes during ethylene-induced hyponastic growth and petiole elongation. From those, 21 have very good homology with Arabidopsis genes. The expression kinetics of these genes were monitored in response to ethylene and submergence using Real Time RTPCR and the putative involvement of candidate genes in (differential) growth during ethylene and submergence treatment was confirmed. Furthermore, we applied whole genome profiling by hybridising mRNA from R. palustris to a CATMA spotted array containing Arabidopsis gene specific tags. This resulted in more than 5000 genes that were differentially regulated in one or both traits. Additionally, the presence of transcription factor binding motifs in the promoters of the differentially expressed genes were examined and demonstrated an over-representation of Abscisic acid responsive elements. Aanalysing the function of putative R. palustris orthologous genes in Arabidopsis during ethylene-induced hyponastic growth revealed that a subset of these genes is likely to control the initial angle of the petiole since, mutations in these genes resulted in constitutive elevated initial petiole angles in Arabidopsis mutant plants compared to the wild type Columbia-0. The others have an effect on either the angle of the petiole or leaf blade angle or both. Mutant analysis revealed a role for PSI-H subunit of photosystem I, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and glutamate synthase in hyponastic growth of Arabidopsis. Furthermore, the effect of auxin response factor ARF8 on hyponastic growth was demonstrated. Reversible protein phosphorylation is a fundamental strategy used by eukaryotes to regulate basic cellular function. Upon a variety of stimuli, kinases phosphorylate downstream kinases usually until the target transcription factor is phosphorylated. Moreover, for many metabolic processes reversible phosphorylation of proteins is a key regulatory mechanism. We examined changes in the kinome profile of R. palustris in response to enhanced levels of ethylene and we discovered differential activity of many kinases. From these experiments, however, we cannot conclude the exact protein kinases involved in ethylene-induced (differential) growth. Our results do show, however, that the kinase regulatory system is strongly regulated during ethylene enriched conditions that induce hyponastic growth and petiole elongation in R. palustris.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Molecular dissection of the chicken Toll-like receptor repertoire'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are host immune sensors that continuously search for the presence of microbial pathogens. TLRs play a key role in the innate defense against pathogens and the development of adaptive immunity, and are important determinants of the susceptibility to infections. The receptors are present in virtually all species, including insects, amphibians, fish, birds and mammals. Yet, the activity of the TLR family in the different species is variable and unpredictable. The TLRs are divided in different families based on homology, ligand specificity, function and cellular localization. TLR2 together with either TLR1 or TLR6 recognizes tri- and di-acylated lipopeptides, respectively. Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is recognized by the TLR4/MD-2 complex, and TLR5 is the receptor for bacterial flagellin. TLR3, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9 are expressed intracellularly and are activated by dsRNA (TLR3), ssRNA (TLR7 and TLR8) and bacterial DNA (TLR9). Activation of TLRs results in the production of antimicrobial peptides and pro-inflammatory and immunomodulating molecules (cytokines, chemokines) that give rise to an effective antimicrobial response and direct the adaptive immune system. The present study was designed to determine the function of the chicken TLR repertoire. Chicken often carry infectious agents that cause human disease. Knowledge of the chicken innate defense against these pathogens may provide important clues as to how to eradicate these pathogens from chicken. Genome analysis indicates that chicken may express orthologs of TLR1/6/10, TLR2 (type 1 and type 2), TLR3, TLR4, TLR5 and TLR7. Two types of TLRs, TLR15 and TLR21, appear to absent in mammals. We cloned the chicken TLRs and tested their functions using the major foodborne pathogen Salmonella as a model infectious agent. In Chapter 2, we show that expression of chTLR2 type 2 together with the TLR1/6/10 ortholog, which we termed chTLR16, induces a potent innate immune response towards both di-and tri-acylated lipopeptides. The chTLR2/chTLR16 complex thus combines the functions of the mammalian TLR2/6 and TLR2/1 heterodimers in a single TLR complex. For chTLR4 we discovered that this TLR in conjunction with chMD-2 responds to LPS. The complex formation between chTLR4 and chMD-2 is species-specific (Chapter 3). Of particular interest, the chTLR4 complex failed to activate one of the signaling pathways that is activated by the mammalian TLR4 complex, which may explain the relative resistance of chicken to LPS. The chTLR5 receptor responds to Salmonella flagellin (Chapter 4). Targeted mutagenesis of the flagellin protein showed species-specific recognition of the flagellin compared to the human and mouse TLR5. Chapter 5 reports the elucidation of the function of chTLR21 which is absent in mammalian species. This receptor responds to CpG DNA but with broader specificity than human or murine TLR9. Our results provide evidence that the chicken TLR system is functional and has several unique properties both at the level of ligand specificity, the formation of TLR receptor complexes, and activated TLR signaling pathways. This knowledge opens novel opportunities for rational design of the much needed vaccines against major bacterial foodborne pathogens, thus contributing to food safety.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Oxygen insufficiency (hypoxia) is a common feature of human cancer and associated with tumor aggressiveness and poor clinical outcome. Furthermore, hypoxic tumors are more resistant to ionizing radiation and chemotherapy contributing to their unfavorable prognosis. The oxygen sensing pathway is controlled by the transcription factor: hypoxia inducible factor or HIF. HIFs control the expression of genetic cascades involved in the adaptation to the hypoxic microenvironment resulting in increased glucose transport and metabolism, and induced vascularization and motility to secure tumor cell survival under low oxygen. Resolving the molecular networks engaged by HIF proteins could offer new opportunities for targeted treatment of hypoxic tumors. One of these, COMMD1 was identified by us as a HIF interacting protein whose loss of function in mice is critical for the normal HIF responses. In vitro studies demonstrated that reduced COMMD1 expression caused increased HIF-1alpha protein stability and HIF-1 activity. COMMD1 interacts directly with HIF-1alpha and promotes ubiquitin-independent degradation by competition with the chaperone HSP90. Since silencing of COMMD1 dramatically increases HIF-1 activity together even under normal oxygen tension makes COMMD1 a candidate tumor suppressor that when mutated could lead to uncontrolled HIF activity. This hypothesis is currently being investigated. The use of engineered therapeutic antibodies as drugs is currently increasing. Especially single-domain antibodies are promising. The family of Camelidae encode, in addition to their normal IgG repertoire, single domains variable heavy chain antibodies (VHH). Due to their molecular nature these antibodies can be cloned and used for phage display. We selected and engineered two anti-HIF-1 VHH into hetero-bivalent antibodies that could be used in a number of immunological applications. Furthermore, when conditional expression of these VHH in mammalian cells we could inhibit HIF-1 activity. In addition, employing selections of VHH on whole hypoxic cells we identified alpha3beta1 (VLA-3) integrin by use of reverse proteomics as upregulated under hypoxia. It would be worthwhile to explore if this VHH may be employed for imaging selectively hypoxic tumors. Clostridium is an obligate anaerobe bacterium that colonizes and propagates in hypoxic regions of solid cancers and causes partial destruction of the cancer by bacteriolysis. We proposed the use of Clostridium strains as a vehicle for targeted antibody therapy specific for hypoxic tumors. For the first time we demonstrate that VHH encoding plasmids can be transduced and expressed in these Clostridium. This is the first step towards Clostridium directed antibody therapy or CDAT that hold promise as a carrier of anti-cancer therapeutics targeting the most resistant regions in human solid cancer.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['We now have a general idea of which genes and cellular pathways are central in cancer development: uncontrolled growth governs establishment and spread of the disease. Nevertheless, to fully appreciate the consequences of the interplay of driver mutations in this genetic disease it is imperative we understand the mechanisms behind uncontrolled growth, or escape of growth arrest, in cancer. It is still not fully understood how cells escape the tumor-suppressing activity of p53, the most mutated gene in cancer. How p53 is regulated and recruited to protect against tumor formation is well known, but it is less well known how it executes this function. By studying the tumor-suppressive activity of p53 in both a biased and unbiased manner I have identified various molecules and mechanisms that may intersect with p53 function when it comes to uncontrolled cell growth, or tumor initiation. I have found that there is a reciprocal regulation of p53 and growth stimulatory signals, since activation of p53 results in an arrest in the cell cycle, or senescence, by blocking growth signaling, and that hyperactive growth factor signaling can override p53 function. Interestingly, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), one of the molecules I found to be causally involved in senescence, and which normally is activated by p53 under stressful conditions, is a secreted protein and has its most direct function on the outside of a cell. Hence, it can be regarded a gatekeeper of cell cycle progression. My findings also suggest that a molecule that formerly was coupled to extra-cellular cross-talk between cells and wound-healing apparently directly controls cycling of a cell. PAI-1 was already known to be involved in tumor progression (a process dependent on excessive communication between cells), since it highly influences metastatic behavior of a cell. For example, quantification of this molecule is used in the clinic as a marker for breast cancer progression. Next to this I screened for genes that, when hyperactivated, interfere with anti-tumorigenic p53 activity, and found that lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) activity induce a senescence-bypass. LPA is a lipid involved in growth and wound healing processes. This further supports the notion that growth factor- and p53 signaling are linked. I also found that TGFbeta, a molecule with strong tumor suppressive activity, needs PAI-1 for its anti-tumorigenic effect. One of the biggest questions regarding TGFbeta dependent tumorigenesis is what mutations drive the transition from tumor intitiation to tumor progression or, in other words, what mutations make cells less sensitive to innate anti-tumorigenic activity of stress signals. I hypothesize that PAI-1 may be a central player and necessary downstream of both anti-tumorigenic p53- and TGFbeta signaling. My findings shed light on how intra-cellular tumor-suppressive gene programs result in specific communicative behavior of cells, and support the notion that wound healing and tumor-progression have parallel mechanisms. Furthermore, it provides us insight in the cross-talk between some of the key players in cancer initiation and progression which were previously not linked.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['This thesis describes copper-associated chronic hepatitis as a new disease in the Labrador. A study of 143 dogs that were prospectively assessed for clinical parameters, laboratory results, and liver copper concentrations, as well as histologic signs of inflammation revealed that more than two thirds of family members from dogs with CACH have liver copper concentrations above the normal reference range. In addition almost half of these clinically normal dogs with elevated hepatic copper concentrations had chronic hepatitis. Male gender appeared to protect dogs from copper-associated hepatitis. Molecular biologic approaches to investigate the disease included genotyping of microsatellite markers in a candidate gene approach, as well as genome wide genotyping of 340 microsatellite markers, and 22.000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) per dog. Furthermore sequencing analysis was performed, and the expression of genes was assessed by microarray analysis and quantitative PCR. Our study excluded all investigated candidate genes from involvement in hepatic copper accumulation, under the condition that a single disease gene exists. From a genome wide genotyping approach 3 regions of possible linkage were identified within the canine genome. Based on these results further search for underlying genetic defects was narrowed down from 24.000 Mb of the whole canine genome to 3 regions of 2 Mb each. Furthermore 5 novel genes were identified that may represent an acute response to copper overload. Our randomized, double-blinded, and placebo-controlled treatment trial showed that D-penicillamine is an effective drug to decrease hepatic copper concentrations in affected Labradors., but due to the fact that the disease is most likely caused by an inherited genetic defect lifelong cure cannot be achieved with a single treatment regimen, and re-accumulation of copper is likely. Therefore a more balanced long term control of hepatic copper concentrations was the aim of our diet trial that investigated a low-copper diet as well as the usefulness of additional management with zinc. This study revealed an excellent treatment response of dogs with hepatic copper accumulation to feeding of a copper-restricted diet. Therefore it is possible that nutritional contents of copper may have an impact on the development of the disease. Stern and his colleagues from the R. Samuel McLaughlin Center for Population Health Risk assessment, in collaboration with the International Copper association recently described the difficulty of an exact definition of a safe range of copper in food and water, because studies investigating both endpoints are pending. Similar difficulties have been encountered by the European Commissions for Health and Consumer Protection directorate in a recent report, as well as the Committee on Copper in Drinking Water of the National Research Council. Our results are likely to provide some additional insight into copper metabolism. Our ongoing genetic work will likely discover new genes of copper metabolism. Thus we will probably soon be able to answer the important question “Are there additional copper homeostatic genes ?” that was recently posed by the International Copper association with a clear “Yes, there are !”.'],\n",

A large part of patients will have remaining symptoms for the rest of their lives. A number of hypotheses have been made, trying to explain the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. One of these hypotheses is that inflammations may in part be involved in the disease. Inflammations can be inhibited by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and with glucocorticosteroids (GCS). The aim of this thesis was to investigate the relation between these anti-inflammatory drugs and schizophrenia. We first examined the financial burden of psychotic and other psychiatric disorders in the Netherlands. In total there are an estimated 21.000 patients with a psychotic disorder between the ages of 18 and 65. The associated healthcare costs are estimated at 147 million euros yearly. This results in around 7000 euros healthcare costs per case of schizophrenia per year. Two retrospective case-control studies were performed. The first investigated whether the use of NSAIDs was associated with psychosis. We indeed found a decreased risk for incident anti-psychotic use in men, however not in women. The relative risk in men was 0.41 (95% confidence-limits (CI): 0.17–0.97), when results were adjusted for age and total prescription volume. The results suggest that the use of NSAIDs is associated with a decrease risk of subsequent psychosis. The second retrospective study investigated the association between GCS and psychosis. This time a psychosis was defined by a new diagnosis of a psychotic disorder as registered in a psychiatric case register. Again we found an association between the anti-inflammatory GCS and a new diagnosis of a psychotic disorder for men only. The crude relative risk for men using systemic or inhaled GCS was 0.52 (95% CI: 0.36–0.75). This association was present also in the youngest subgroup and a dose-response relation appeared to be present. The main study in this thesis was a double-blind placebo controlled randomized adjuvant trail investigating the effect of the NSAID aspirin. During three months of follow up participants with a schizophrenic disorder were randomized to either aspirin or placebo, together with pantoprazole. The severity of symptoms was estimated using the positive and negative symptom scale (PANSS). The change in total PANSS score was the primary outcome, with secondary outcomes being changes on its subscales and on a number of cognitive tests. We found a significant monthly treatment effect of -1.62 (95% CI -2.93;-0.30) points on the total PANSS and on the positive PANSS subscale (-0.52 (95% CI -1.02;-0.02). The effect was substantially larger in patients with a lower immune ratio, as indicated by TH1/TH2 immune balance (p=0.018). Trends for the negative and general PANSS sub-scores were similar to the trends in the total and positive scores, without reaching statistical significance. Aspirin did not affect cognitive functions. The results of this randomized trial indicate that aspirin may be a beneficial therapy in combination with anti-psychotic drugs in schizophrenia.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['In general, patients expect that the medical treatment they receive is provided by physicians who adhere to professional norms which are based on evidence. The existence of variations in medical practice challenges that general belief. In the assumption that treatment by physicians is based on theoretical knowledge and the medical condition of the patient, similar patients with similar conditions would receive the same treatment, irrespective of the physician, hospital or practice they attend. However, examples from literature show a different situation. In this book several hypotheses on the causes of medical practice variation were empirically tested. An approach was applied that emphasized social conditions that, by providing opportunities and constraints, influence physicians’ medical behavior. This approach predicts variation between physicians working in different work environments and similarities between physicians sharing the same work environment, such as a practice or a hospital. The importance of social organization and institutional mechanisms was confirmed in explaining medical practice variation. Data were used from two national data collections held in the Netherlands amongst general practitioners: the First and Second Dutch National Survey of General Practice (DNSGP1 and DNSGP2). These data were collected in 1987 and 2001 respectively. Furthermore, data were obtained from the New York Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS). The 1999, 2000 and 2001 SPARCS-data were used. The analyses in this book were performed using multilevel analyses Three mechanisms that generate variation between and homogeneity within groups were tested: selection, gradual adaptation towards group norms and rapid adaptation to circumstances. The results pointed towards the importance of similarities based on shared circumstances. It also showed that the most common explanation of medical practice variations based on individual preferences was unsatisfactory. The implication is that medical practice variations are not merely individual differences in preferred practice styles, but are patterned by social processes in partnerships and local circumstances. Knowing that, we moved on with testing institutional mechanisms and their effect on variation. The relationship between the institutional mechanisms and circumstances is that institutional mechanisms, as used in this book, have an effect on the circumstances that influence variation. Three mechanisms of how institutions work were examined: the regulative, normative, and the cultural-cognitive mechanism. These three mechanisms were hypothesized to influence variation. Testing the institutional mechanisms was important for understanding medical practice variation. Besides an explanation, the institutional mechanisms provide instruments that can be used in influencing variation. We showed that institutional mechanisms are effective in influencing physicians’ behavior, and therefore could be used in limiting variation. However, we found no empirical evidence proving that institutional mechanisms reduce variation in this study. This book contributed to understanding medical practice variation and the mechanisms underlying it without a normative opinion on the existence of variation. With this book we made progress in explaining medical practice variations and in the methodology that can be used in analyzing medical practice variation.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Despite significant progress in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases, heart failure is still a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in industrial countries. Sustained cardiac hypertrophy, which is defined as an increase in heart size resulting from an increase in cardiomyocyte cell volume, has been recognized as the single most important risk factor for heart failure development. Cardiac hypertrophy can be initiated by a wide array of (neuro/humoral) growth factors in response to increased workload, injury, or intrinsic defects in contractile performance. To understand the molecular determinants of the hypertrophic response and to achieve future rational drug design to treat heart failure, investigation currently focuses on identifying and characterizing intracellular signal transduction pathways in the heart. The experiments presented in this thesis focus on a signaling pathway which plays a role in the hypertrophic transcriptional response of the myocyte. This signaling route employs the Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin and its immediate downstream transcriptional effector Nuclear Factor of Activated T-cells (NFAT), and further focuses on the immediate downstream NFAT target genes in cardiac muscle.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Gastrointestinal polyposis syndromes are characterized by the development of gastrointestinal polyps and an increased risk for neoplastic transformation. Peutz-Jeghers syndrome is a polyposis syndrome characterized by the development of gastrointestinal hamartomas; the molecular and histopathological origin of these polyps is unclear and hence the pre-malignant potential, if any, of these polyps remains unresolved. Current follow-up protocols mandate removal of polyps to decrease risk of intussusception as well as to decrease risk of neoplastic transformation. The current thesis investigates the premalignant potential of these polyps and proposes that in fact the polyps are an epiphenomenon to the malignant condition. Polyp removal therefore does not necessarily reduce cancer risk. Furthermore we show that abnormalities can be demonstrated in normal (id est unaffected) epithelia in Peutz-Jeghers syndrome that may suggest protracted clonal evolution at the level of the intestinal stem cell niche. Altered clonal evolution in the crypt would jointly explain the development of the benign gastrointestinal hamartomas as well as an increased risk for neoplastic transformation in these patients. Lastly, we show that the linchpin component of the Wnt signalling pathway, beta-catenin, appears on the plasma membrane upon Wnt treatment in Wnt-responsive cells. This suggests a previously unappreciated step in a signalling pathway frequently deregulated in familial and sporadic forms of colorectal cancer.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Renovascular disease (RVD) is a potentially reversible cause of renal failure and renovascular hypertension. However, in the absence of definitive clinical trials, there is a lack of evidence regarding its optimal management. We first addressed the central role of renal function in cardiovascular disease (CVD) in part I of this thesis. Renal function seems to have a strong relationship with atherosclerosis, a generalized process which starts early in life. In patients with manifest vascular disease, we demonstrated that with more severe atherosclerosis, the decrease in renal size and function with age was more pronounced than with less severe atherosclerosis. We also found that moderate to severely impaired renal function was an independent predictor of future CVD. In the second part of this thesis, imaging techniques of the renal artery are studied, with both MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) and angiography. MRI offers a means to assess anatomical as well as functional information about the kidney, in a non-invasive way. We measured the blood flow in the renal arteries in healthy volunteers with MRI, but found that in the relatively small and mobile renal arteries, this measurement was difficult, with limited reproducibility. Until the end of the 90s, stent placement was the treatment of choice for atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (ARAS). However, a recurrent stenosis can occur in the stent. We found that in-stent stenoses can well be treated with balloon dilatation or placement of a second stent, with good technical success rates after a year. Part III describes the STAR trial, a multicenter randomized trial about the treatment of patients with renal impairment and ARAS. Stent placement has been proved to be a feasible technique in the treatment of ARAS, with good long term patency. However, evidence for the superiority of stent placement compared to medical treatment only in terms of renal function, is lacking. We randomized 140 patients with impaired renal function (creatinine clearance 50% ARAS to medical treatment only or medical treatment plus stent placement of the renal artery. In both groups, medical treatment consisted of blood pressure and lipid-lowering drugs and a statin. Patients were followed for 2 years and compared in terms of renal function. The primary end point was defined as >20% decrease in creatinine clearance. We found no statistically significant difference between the patients in the medication or the stent group. However, serious complications related to the stent placement procedure occurred in the stent group, with a mortality rate of 3%. Stent placement might be beneficial in patients with a unilateral stenosis, but this will need to be confirmed after a longer follow-up. The balance between preservation of renal function by improved medication and the adverse events following stent placement, is not in favor of stent placement. The findings of the STAR trial favor a conservative therapeutic approach to patients with ARAS, focused on cardiovascular risk factor management.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Factor VIII trafficking to Weibel-Palade bodies'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Summary Factor (F)VIII is an essential cofactor in the enzymatic coagulation cascade. A defect in the gene encoding for FVIII results in the X-linked inherited bleeding disorder hemophilia A. In the circulation, FVIII is protected from proteolytic degradation and premature clearance by forming a complex with its carrier protein von Willebrand factor (VWF). While the complex of FVIII and VWF involves one of the strongest protein-protein interactions in the human body, it has remained unclear when and where FVIII and VWF first interact. The most widely accepted view is that FVIII and VWF are secreted from different cells and form a complex in the circulation, merely by virtue of their high-affinity interaction. During the last decade however, increasing evidence has been presented that suggests that the human body should also comprise a releasable storage pool of both proteins. In this thesis, we have studied the relationship between high-affinity interaction in the circulation and intracellular co-storage of FVIII and VWF. We have taken a new approach towards this issue by creating fluorescently tagged VWF and FVIII proteins that are established as being deficient in high-affinity interaction. We have demonstrated that FVIII is stored in VWF-containing storage organelles in absence of high-affinity interaction and that the extent of FVIII storage is independent of its affinity for VWF. In addition, we studied the therapeutic benefit of intracellular co-expression of FVIII and VWF in terms of potential treatment options for hemophilia A. We have shown that blood outgrowth endothelial cells can produce high levels of functional FVIII over a prolonged period of time. In addition, we have demonstrated that a substantial amount of FVIII can be stored in VWF-containing storage organelles whereas the majority of FVIII is released in a constitutive manner. From our data, we conclude that the structural requirements that determine high-affinity interaction between FVIII and VWF in the circulation differ from those that determine intracellular co-trafficking. Our data provide a molecular explanation for the fact that hemophilia A and von Willebrand’s disease patients that suffer from impaired complex assembly of FVIII and VWF in the circulation show concomitant increase of FVIII and VWF plasma levels following treatment with desmopressin. The mechanism that determines FVIII storage in VWF-containing granules as well as the therapeutic potential of FVIII expression in VWF producing cells now awaits further exploration.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The mechanisms by which host plants contribute to their colonization by hemibiotrophic and biotrophic fungal and oomycete pathogens is a poorly understand aspect of molecular plant pathology. The aim of this study was to identify Arabidopsis genes controlling cellular processes that influence susceptibility to the biotrophic oomycete Hyaloperonospora parasitica. Chapter 2 describes a forward genetic approach to identify Arabidopsis mutants that show loss of compatibility to H. parasitica. Six of these so called downy mildew resistant (dmr) mutants were characterized in more detail. dmr3 and dmr4 show resistance to a broad range of pathogens whereas dmr1, dmr2, dmr5 and dmr6 show a type of resistance more specific to H. parasitica. Chapter 3 shows that constitutive high expression of defense related genes in the dmr5 mutant contributes to resistance to H. parasitica. Surprisingly, it was found that dmr5 mutants were mutated in RPM1, a resistance gene of the NBS-LRR class that confers resistance to Pseudomonas syringae bacteria carrying the avrB or avrRPM1 genes. RPM1 function in dmr5 mutants is largely, but not completely, lost. Genetic data indicate that dmr5 encodes a mild autoactive form of RPM1. Further studies on the mutant RPM1 protein could provide more insight to R protein function. Chapter 4 describes the map based cloning of DMR6 that encodes a putative 2OG-Fe(II) oxygenase. DMR6 is strongly induced in infected host cells during both compatible and incompatible interactions with H. parasitica. DMR6 is also highly induced after application of BTH and is constitutively high expressed in broad range disease resistance mutants. Absence of a functional DMR6 gene results in resistance to H. parasitica, that is accompanied with high expression of several defense-related genes including DMR6 itself. Together, the obtained data indicate that DMR6 is a negative regulator of defense. Chapter 5 describes the identification of a group of Arabidopsis genes that is induced during compatible interactions but not during incompatible interactions. Most of these so called compatible-specific genes (CS-genes) are also induced during various abiotic stress conditions such as cold, dehydration, high salt and high light, but also in response to ABA. The activation of CS-genes can either reflect a physiological response on pathogen infection or be triggered by pathogen effector proteins. As the CS-genes are not induced as part of a defense response they provide a first glimpse into non-defense related processes during compatible interactions.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The primary aim of this thesis was to investigate the clinical-diagnostic value of the Foveal Reflection Analyzer (FRA). This was achieved by studying cone-photoreceptor involvement in several ophthalmic diseases. A secondary aim was to investigate the putative protective role of macular pigment and melanin on the incidence and progression of aging macula disorder (AMD). In the course of the study, we also performed a study with the Macular Pigment Reflectometer to investigate the possibility to separately measure the optical densities of lutein and zeaxanthin, the constituents of the macular pigment, in vivo. This had not been achieved before. The FRA measures the spectral and directional properties of light reflected from the fovea. Together with a model fit procedure it provides, in a fast and patient friendly way, a series of parameters that stand for properties of reflectors and absorbers in the eye. In particular, it provides Rd, a parameter for the reflection from cone outer segments, an indication for the integrity of the foveal cones. By using Rd, the FRA can be used as a sensitive device for the objective determination of foveal cone abnormalities. We have shown that in diabetes patients without retinopathy (chapter 4), and in primary open-angle glaucoma patients with severe central visual field defects (chapter 5), the integrity of the foveal cone outer segments was compromised. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) did not reveal any foveal abnormalities. In a case of central serous chorioretinopathy (chapter 2)and one of multiple evanescent white dot syndrome (chapter 3), the FRA was able to detect and follow-up the foveal cone integrity status in a quantitative way. This was also possible with OCT, but only in a qualitative way, by observing the foveal photoreceptor inner/outer segment junction. A difference in melanin or macular pigment optical density larger than respectively 32% or 34% measured with the FRA between the two eyes of one person might point to pathology in either eye (chapter 8). As additional information the FRA provides the optical densities of retinal macular pigment and (sub)retinal melanin. Both pigments are thought to protect against AMD. However, using both a cross-sectional (chapter 6) and a longitudinal study (chapter 7), we found no significant evidence that macular pigment or melanin played a protective role against early AMD. The FRA is also able to measure the constituents of the macular pigment, zeaxanthin and lutein, separately in vivo. In chapter 9 this was outlined for the Macular Pigment Analyzer, a simplified version of the FRA and might help to further untangle the interesting question whether MP or one of its constituents protects against AMD. We have proven that fundus reflectometry together with a model fit procedure can be used for the follow-up of temporal changes in the optical density of macular pigment or its constituents after supplementation with zeaxanthin. Knowledge on foveal cone integrity and optical lens density in different stages of several ophthalmic diseases might also contribute to a better understanding of the pathology of these diseases.'],\n",

In the first chapter the current knowledge on the relationships between  pharmacokinetics and treatment outcomes is summarised into practical guidelines for TDM. In subsequent chapters the pharmacokinetics of selected PIs and  NNRTIs are studied in representative patient populations. Moreover, determinants of pharmacokinetic variability are assessed. Several studies have been  performed in view of the large international randomised 2NN study. This was the first study to compare the safety and efficacy of nevirapine and efavirenz containing regimens in treatment-naive HIV-1-infected patients. Within this trial, several clinical pharmacological substudies were performed. A requirement to perform these substudies is the availability of validated bioanalytical methods to assess quantitatively plasma concentrations of nevirapine and efavirenz. In this thesis, the development and validation for the simultaneous determination of the NNRTIs efavirenz and nevirapine in human plasma is described. Afterwards, population pharmacokinetics of nevirapine and efavirenz and its determinants were characterised in several studies.

       "  'Description': ['The presented studies were conducted within the framework of the international ADDITION study (Anglo-Danish-Dutch Study of Intensive Treatment in People with Screen-Detected Diabetes in Primary Care), a randomised controlled trial in 3,057 screen-detected type 2 diabetic patients. The aim of ADDITION is to evaluate whether screening for type 2 diabetes in general practice is feasible and subsequent intensified, multifactorial treatment beneficial. Intensified treatment consisted of pharmacological treatment combined with lifestyle education. From 2002 to 2004, 56,978 subjects, aged 50-70 years, from 79 general practices in the Netherlands, were invited to participate in a screening programme starting with a questionnaire. Eventually, 586 (1.0%) diabetic patients were diagnosed. Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and impaired fasting glucose (IFG) were assessed in 1,011 participants (1.8%). The risk score was higher if glucose metabolism was more disturbed. The yield of population-based screening is low. Case-finding in general practice might be more appropriate to detect undiagnosed diabetes. The yield of screening varied widely between practices. Outcome measure was the ratio screen-detected diabetic patients/known diabetic patients per practice. The ratio ranged from 0.8% to 20.0% (mean 7.5% 4.5). A lower yield, plausibly reflecting a lower prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes, was not associated with specific GP and practice characteristics. This finding stresses the importance of a screening programme in each practice. Screened persons with IFG had lower weight and blood pressure than those with IGT and diabetes suggesting IFG to be a condition with less risk to develop cardiovascular diseases. When glycaemic control was poorer, levels of BMI, blood pressure and lipids were worse. The increased cardiovascular risk of hyperglycaemia is notably present in overweight persons. People with lower fasting glucose levels at diagnosis may be at an earlier stage of the disease. 498 patients were divided into tertiles of fasting glucose. Cardiovascular risk markers did not differ substantially between tertiles. Coffee consumption (>2 cups daily) was associated with better, alcohol abstinence with worse fasting glycaemic control. SES was not associated with the level of glycaemic control. Analyses with interaction terms between lifestyle and SES appeared to be not significant. Lifestyle behaviours and socioeconomic factors are not helpful to identify specific categories of patients to be screened for diabetes. 1-year results showed improvements of BMI, blood pressure, HbA1c, and cholesterol in the intensively treated group to be significantly better than in the routine care group. At end of follow-up, in the two treatment groups similar health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was reported. Intensified multifactorial treatment of screen-detected diabetic patients in general practice reduces cardiovascular risk factor levels significantly without worsening HRQoL. After three years of follow-up, screened subjects with an elevated risk score but without diabetes had cardiovascular event rates comparable with diabetic patients. During follow-up numbers of prescriptions of cardiovascular medication, practice visits and glucose, lipid, and blood pressure measurements were highest in diabetic patients. Screened non-diabetic subjects are at risk of lacking optimal medical care in order to control for cardiovascular risk factors. They should not be reassured only because of not having diabetes.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The aim of this thesis is to find strategies to develop vaccines for protection against pathogens that do not induce adequate protective immunity after natural infection or after vaccination with the infectious agent. To reach this objective, three main areas needed to be controlled: 1) detailed monitoring of antigen specific responses by both B cells and T cells, and the resulting antibodies, 2) measuring qualitative and quantitative variations in the induction method by using antigens of reduced complexity. Only when the specificity is under full control, comparisons can be made, 3) stimuli to modulate the nature of a response independent of specificity. These three areas form the main subjects of the different chapters in this thesis. The authors have focussed on the chicken to study effects of vaccine composition on the immunological response. Studies in livestock and companion animals have additional value compared to common experimental animals, because they are both the experimental and the target species at the same time. As in mammals, respiratory infections in poultry are an important cause of disease. Infectious Bronchitis Virus and Escherichia coli were the pathogens of choice to study vaccine strategies in this thesis. In this thesis, the development of an ELISPOT and intracellular staining assay are described as novel tools to examine T cell responses in the chicken. Using these tools, the phenomenon of polyclonal stimulation of chicken immune cells by IBV has been investigated. We also examined DNA immunization as a vaccine strategy to protect chickens against IBV. To gain insight into the effects of immune modulation on inflammatory responses, enhanced susceptibility of broilers to Escherichia coli infection after exposure to IBV was studied. The results presented in this thesis provide useful insights into host-pathogen interactions and the immunological processes behind vaccination. It is hoped that these news insights can contribute to the development of improved vaccines and vaccination strategies.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Following widespread application of assisted reproductive technology modalities and the increased age of motherhood, the incidence of twin gestations has increased markedly. Twins are either monozygotic or dizygotic. Dizygotic (i.e. fraternal) twins result from the fertilization of two different eggs and are per definition dichorionic (DC). Chorionicity of monozygotic twins (i.e. identical twins) depends on timing of splitting of the fertilized egg. If splitting occurs within three days after fertilization, the monozygotic twin will be DC. Splitting after the third day results in monochorionic (MC) twinning. Twins have an increased risk of perinatal mortality and neonatal morbidity compared to singletons. MC twin pregnancies, which occur in about 1 of 400 pregnancies, carry a higher risk of perinatal complications compared to DC twins. This is mainly attributed to the unique architecture of the MC placenta. The aim of this thesis was to study perinatal mortality and (long-term) morbidity in MC and DC twin pregnancies. We report on perinatal outcome in 1407 twin pregnancies from two Dutch centers in which we found an almost 9-fold higher risk of intrauterine fetal death in MC twins compared to DC twins. In most of these cases, no antenatal signs of impaired fetal condition had been present. To further elucidate the risk of unexpected fetal death in MC twin pregnancies, a cohort from ten Dutch perinatal centers was established which is the largest cohort of MC twin pregnancies to date (n=639). In this series, the prospective risk of fetal death after 32 weeks of gestation was 0.5%. This risk, albeit increased, was not as high as previously estimated. Compared to a cohort of twin pregnancies in the early 1900s, when fetal surveillance and intervention options were limited, perinatal mortality has decreased considerably in DC pregnancies but only to a lesser extend in MC twins. A study on the role of Doppler velocimetry findings in MC twin pregnancies revealed that current antenatal surveillance sometimes fails to predict and prevent adverse outcome in MC twin gestations. This has led to the discussion as to how to manage the (uncomplicated) MC twin pregnancy. The relatively low prospective risk of death after 32 weeks of gestation does not justify elective preterm delivery. However, mortality at term was still 3 times higher in MC twins as compared to singletons and term DC twins and did occur in pregnancies in which spontaneous onset of labour was awaitened (?37 weeks). We therefore suggest planned delivery of the MC diamniotic twin around 37 weeks of gestation. Fortunately, long-term outcome of MC twins was favorable in the absence of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) or co-twin death and we found no differences in outcome between MC and DC twins. Perinatal outcome was also studied in 98 monoamniotic (MA) twin pregnancies, a rare subgroup of MC twins. In our large series, the risk of perinatal mortality was still high (17%) and mortality occurred throughout pregnancy. This elevated risk was not associated with the vascular architecture of the MA placenta. Intensive monitoring and early delivery seemed to reduce perinatal mortality after 32 weeks of gestation.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Acute pancreatitis is a common, costly, potentially lethal, and poorly understood disease, mostly caused by gallstones. In the past decade the incidence of acute pancreatitis in the Netherlands increased by 50% to over 3400 admissions in 2006, most likely due to an increase of gallstone disease. About 20% of patients will develop severe acute pancreatitis, a disease characterized by organ failure and/or pancreatic necrosis, resulting in a high mortality rate. Because the incidence of acute pancreatitis is increasing rapidly and it is estimated that about 80% of deaths are associated with infections, especially infected pancreatic necrosis, the main aim of this thesis was to develop and test (A) Prevention strategies; aimed at preventing acute pancreatitis and associated infections, and (B) Intervention strategies; aimed at improving outcome of intervention in patients with infected pancreatic necrosis. Most studies described in this thesis are performed by the centres participating in the Dutch Acute Pancreatitis Study Group (2002), including all Dutch university medical centres. Prevention Strategies Previous, small, retrospective studies had suggested that ursodeoxocholic acid was capable of preventing biliary pancreatitis in patients with symptomatic gallstone disease. We disproved this suggestion in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trial. Previous, small, placebo-controlled randomised trials had suggested a beneficial effect of probiotic prophylaxis in acute pancreatitis. We performed a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial on probiotic prophylaxis in 296 patients and found that in fact mortality doubled due to the use of probiotic prophylaxis. In a follow-up study we found that the negative effect of probiotics was related to intestinal small bowel mucosal damage but solely in patients with organ failure receiving probiotics. In a second follow-up study we found that infections complications occurred much earlier in the course of acute pancreatitis, already in the first days, than previously expected. New studies should therefore start prophylactic therapy earlier than is currently practiced. Intervention Strategies The overall mortality rate for infected pancreatic necrosis in 11 large hospitals in the Netherlands was found to be as high as 34%. The results of minimally invasive approaches seemed promising but their general applicability in patients with infected necrotizing pancreatitis was unknown. In a follow-up study we found that 84% of patients could have been treated via a minimally invasive approach. It had furthermore been suggested that delaying surgical intervention in infected pancreatic necrosis facilitates safer intervention. We confirmed this hypothesis in a systematic review and concluded that, whenever possible, necrosectomy should be postponed until 30 days after initial hospital admission so that the collection becomes encapsulated. The type of intervention in patients with infected peripancreatic collections containing depends on their content (fluid and/or necrosis) as depicted by CT scan. We performed the first interobserver study on the international Atlanta classification (1992) and found that five experienced radiologists agreed in only 4% of cases on the definition of the collection. It was concluded that the Atlanta classification should be revised, a process that is currently indeed underway.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['High-dose chemotherapy in combination with peripheral blood progenitor cell transplantation has been developed as a possible curative treatment modality in several solid tumours. A frequently used high-dose regimen in the Netherlands is the CTC regimen, which is a 4-day course of cyclophosphamide, thiotepa and carboplatin. High-dose chemotherapy is demanding for the patient. Severe and sometimes life-threatening toxicities may occur after high-dose chemotherapy. Therefore, treatment optimization in order to prevent or reduce toxicity is necessary. Pharmacogenetics focuses on the question to what extent variability in genetic background is responsible for the observed interindividual variability in pharmacokinetics and toxicity and might provide a tool for the a priori identification of patients at risk for severe toxicity. The objectives of this thesis were to identify relations between the genotype of the metabolising enzymes involved in cyclophosphamide, thiotepa and carboplatin metabolism, pharmacokinetics and toxicity in order to identify patients at risk for severe toxicity or under-treatment and, when possible, to develop a strategy for safe dosing of the agents included in the high-dose CTC regimen. Thiotepa is metabolised by cytochrome P450 and glutathione S-transferase enzymes. Polymorphisms of these enzymes may affect elimination of thiotepa and tepa, its main metabolite. Clearance of thiotepa and tepa was shown to be predominantly affected by the GSTP1 C341T polymorphism. Patients homozygous for the variant allele had an increased exposure to thiotepa and tepa of 45% compared to patients with the wild-type genotype. The presently evaluated variant alleles, however, only explained a small part of the substantial interindividual variability in thiotepa and tepa pharmacokinetics. Cyclophosphamide is metabolised by cytochrome P450, glutathione S-transferase and aldehyde dehydrogenase enzymes. The presently evaluated variant alleles in the genes encoding the enzymes important in cyclophosphamide metabolism did not explain the interindividual variability in cyclophosphamide and 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide pharmacokinetics. To obtain more insight into the interindividual variability in toxicity observed after treatment with CTC chemotherapy, relations between polymorphisms in drug metabolising enzymes and toxicity were studied. Sixteen selected polymorphisms in nine genes (CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, GSTA1, GSTP1, ALDH1A1 and ALDH3A1) of putative relevance in cyclophosphamide, thiotepa and carboplatin metabolism were assessed. Patients heterozygous for the ALDH3A1*2 and ALDH1A1*2 allele had an increased risk of haemorrhagic cystitis and liver-toxicity, respectively, compared to patients with wild-type alleles when treated with a high-dose chemotherapy combination of cyclophosphamide, thiotepa and carboplatin. The ALDH enzymes are important in the intracellular detoxification of cyclophosphamide. Therefore, although no effect of polymorphisms in these enzymes on the plasmapharmacokinetics of cyclophosphamide could be demonstrated, differences in susceptibility to toxicity might occur due to differences in intracellular detoxification of the active cyclophosphamide metabolites. In conclusion, although the pharmacokinetics of the components of the CTC regimen are not affected by the variability in the presently evaluated genes to a large extent, it is apparent that variability in genes encoding drug metabolising enzymes does affect the occurrence of toxicity. Pharmacogenetic approaches have potential for identifying patients who are at a higher risk of experiencing toxic side-effects in high-dose chemotherapy.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Colorectal cancer (CRC) is an important cause death. In the Netherlands, approximately 10.000 patients are diagnosed with CRC each year. Rare hereditary gastrointestinal polyposis syndromes predisposing to CRC, including familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), juvenile polyposis (JPS) and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS), have provided a model for the investigation of cancer initiation and progression in the general population. Many insights in the molecular genetic basis of CRC have emerged from studying these syndromes. The first part of this thesis is about duodenal polyposis in FAP and chemoprevention with NSAIDs. With improved management of colorectal disease and increased life expectancy of FAP patients, duodenal polyps and adenocarcinoma have become major health problems in these patients. Surveillance, endoscopic and surgical treatment and the value of NSAID chemoprevention for duodenal polyposis are reviewed. Results of NSAIDs on regression or prevention of duodenal adenomas in FAP appear disappointing. Expression of the main target of NSAIDs, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) was studied and compared between colorectal and duodenal adenomas from patients with FAP. Levels of COX-2 appeared to be significantly higher in the duodenum than in the colorectum of FAP patients, which may explain the poorer response of duodenal adenomas to COX-2 inhibition, suggesting that higher dosages of COX-2 inhibitors are needed for treatment of duodenal adenomas. The second part of this thesis focuses on clinical and molecular aspects of JPS. We performed person-year analysis to define the magnitude of risk for gastrointestinal cancer in JPS. A relative risk of colorectal cancer of 34 and a cumulative life-time risk of 38.7% in JPS was found. JPS is caused by germline mutation of the SMAD4 or BMPR1A gene, but a germline mutation is found in only 30-40% of patients. Likely, alternative ways of inactivation of these genes exist. Therefore, we used MLPA to investigate whether germline deletion of these genes may cause JPS. By combining sequencing and MLPA, a germline defect in SMAD4 or BMPR1A was found in almost 50% of the patients. Nine mutations (33.3%) were detected by direct sequencing, whereas four germline hemizygous large genomic deletion (14.8%) were found using MLPA. Prevention of polyp and neoplasia development in juvenile polyposis using chemoprevention may be useful in the treatment of these patients. We measured expression of COX-2 in juvenile polyps to investigate the potential value of chemoprevention by COX-2 inhibition. Increased levels of COX-2 were found in juvenile polyps from JPS patients, suggesting that chemoprevention using COX-2 inhibition can be beneficial in JPS. Lastly, we studied molecular aspects of juvenile polyps from patients with a SMAD4 germline defect. Focal reduction or loss of SMAD4 expression was present in the epithelium of about half of the juvenile polyps from SMAD4 mutation carriers. LOH or somatic mutation of the wild type SMAD4 allele was found in cases with aberrant SMAD4 protein expression. These findings do not support a “landscaper” mechanism for SMAD4, although stromal haploinsufficiency or loss of SMAD4 may still have a role in polyp initiation and epithelial loss may only occur at a later stage in polyp progression. Surprisingly, loss of epithelial SMAD4 immunostaining did not correlate with dysplasia in polyps, suggesting that loss of the wild type allele is not obligatory for dysplastic change in juvenile polyps, not fitting with the typical tumor-suppressor/“gatekeeper” role for SMAD4, as previously suggested.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['1. We compared 120 patients who had had a large subcortical infarct with 324 who had had a small deep infarct and with 211 who had had a cortical infarct from the same cohort. We found no differences in risk factor profiles between the three groups, nor a difference in stroke recurrence rate. 2. We demonstrated, by means of a questionnaire filled in by 29 neurologists with special interest in stroke, that there is very little agreement on the classification of cause of death in patients who die after a stroke in the setting of a clinical trial. We developed guidelines for the classification of the cause of death after stroke, with the criteria ‘interval between stroke and death’ (cutoff point at 1 month) and ‘best Rankin grade after stroke’ (cutoff at 3). 3. The results of the first part of the European/Australasian Stroke Prevention in Reversible Ischaemia Trial (ESPRIT) are described, in which patients who suffered a Transient Ischaemic Attack (TIA) or non disabling ischaemic stroke of presumed arterial origin were randomized between the combination therapy of aspirin plus dipyridamole (n=1363) and aspirin alone (n=1376). Less patients assigned to the combination therapy (173, 13%) than to aspirin alone (216, 16%) suffered the primary outcome event, which was the composite of death from all vascular causes, non-fatal stroke, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or major bleeding complication, whichever happened first. The corresponding hazard ratio was 0.80 (95% confidence interval 0.66-0.98). 4. The results of the second, prematurely halted, part of ESPRIT are presented. In this part a comparison was made between medium intensity oral anticoagulants (aimed international normalized ratio (INR) 2.0-3.0) and aspirin in the secondary prevention after TIA or non disabling ischaemic stroke of arterial origin. There was no difference in the incidence of the primary outcome event (99 of 536 patients, 19% versus 98 of 532, 18%). There were, however, more major bleeding complications in patients assigned to anticoagulation (45 vs. 18, hazard ratio 2.56 (95% confidence interval 1.48-4.43). 5. The results of an individual patient data based meta-analysis of all trials that compared the combination therapy of aspirin plus dipyridamole with aspirin alone in the secondary prevention after TIA or stroke of arterial origin are presented. Data from 7612 patients (3800 allocated to aspirin plus dipyridamole and 3812 to aspirin alone) were available for this analysis. The hazard ratio for the composite event of vascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction and non-fatal stroke was 0.82 (95% CI 0.72-0.92). Hazard ratios did not differ in subgroup analyses based on patient characteristics, nor across baseline risk strata as assessed with two different risk scores. 6. We did an exploratory analysis on data from ESPRIT and from the Second European Stroke Prevention Study (ESPS 2), with the aim to identify risk factors for the development of headache during treatment with dipyridamole. The factors we found to be associated with discontinuation of dipyridamole because of headache were female sex, no (relevant) ischemic lesion on brain imaging and not smoking.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Prevention of Influenza in Health Care Settings: Models and Observations'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['In this thesis we present five studies that focus on the assessment of prevention and control strategies for influenza in health care institutions. In chapters 2 and 3, we show the difficulties concerning recognition of influenza virus infection in hospital patients and the low willingness of health care workers (HCWs) to receive influenza vaccination. In chapters 4 to 6 we develop and use a mathematical model of influenza virus transmission in health care institutions. With this model we demonstrate how an increase in the proportion of HCWs that is vaccinated, decreases the number of influenza virus infections in long-term care nursing home patients. The relationship between the fraction of HCWs vaccinated and the fraction of patients with an influenza virus infection appears to be linear and a threshold for herd immunity cannot be detected. Our results confirm and extend several previous observational and experimental studies that attempted to quantify the effect of HCW vaccination. In chapter 5, we use the transmission model to extrapolate our findings from the long-term care nursing home environment to a regular hospital environment, for which no data on preventive measures against influenza for HCWs are available from experimental or observational studies. According to the predictions by the model, HCW vaccination in this setting will turn out to be at least as effective and efficient as observed for a nursing home setting. Finally, we modify the model to study the effects and the efficiency of two strategies of prophylaxis with the antiviral agent oseltamivir. Although oseltamivir has been shown to be effective in reducing susceptibility, infectiousness and the probability of developing disease in household studies, its efficacy for outbreak control in health care institutions remains to be determined. Our simulations suggest that post-exposure prophylaxis is not so effective, but far more efficient, than continuous prophylaxis in the protection of nursing home patients against influenza virus infection. Increasing resistance of influenza strains against oseltamivir will reduce the effectiveness and efficiency of both strategies, but post-exposure prophylaxis exerts a weaker selection pressure for resistance than continuous prophylaxis. From our studies we conclude that patients can be best protected by increasing HCW vaccination, which is more effective and more efficient than post-exposure prophylaxis with oseltamivir. Nevertheless, as long as HCW vaccine uptake is suboptimal or in case of a mismatch between the vaccine strains and the circulating viruses, post-exposure prophylaxis for patients is an effective secondary control measure. However, if we aim to protect patients by protecting HCWs, our efforts should be directed on increasing HCW vaccine uptake rather than HCW prophylaxis.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The composition of the pathologic substrate of atherosclerosis, the atherosclerotic plaque, is not taken into account in clinical practice. Atherosclerotic plaques differ greatly in their composition, and we have learned from cross-sectional pathology studies that certain plaques may be more likely to cause clinical events such as a myocardial infarction or stroke. At present, however, plaque composition has no role in clinical decision making. The lack of clinical application is perhaps attributable to a lack of knowledge, which this thesis aims to address. We designed a large biobank containing atherosclerotic plaques obtained during vascular surgery, called Athero-Express. The unique features of this biobank are its size and clinical follow-up. During 6 years, we have included more than 1000 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy and another 500 patients undergoing femoral endarterectomy and aneurysm surgery. The main objectives of the study were to investigate the relation between carotid plaque composition at the time of carotid endarterectomy and occurrence of restenosis and cardiovascular events during follow-up. We were able to establish that the extent of benefit of carotid endarterectomy correlates with carotid plaque composition. In patients groups who benefit most from CEA, we found an increased incidence of “vulnerable” plaques. We hypothesize that the excision of a vulnerable plaque portrays more benefit than a harmless plaque which will never cause any symptoms if it remains in place. These results suggest that pre-operative assessment of plaque characteristics with non-invasive imaging is important to obtain better outcome in patients with carotid artery stenosis, and probably also in other vascular territories. Furthermore, we identified prognostic factors in the atherosclerotic plaque. A large lipid core and marked macrophage infiltration are predictive of restenosis after carotid endarterectomy. The presence of thrombus in the carotid plaque is associated with increased incidence of cardiovascular events during 3-year follow-up. Furthermore, we were able to identify more specific targets to predict outcome. Using a proteomic approach, we identified proteins that were differentially expressed in the plaques from patients who suffered an event during the follow-up, and controls. High expression of Osteopontin was associated with a four-fold increased risk of future cardiovascular events. This predictive value of this protein was independent of clinical risk factors and exceeds biomarkers such as CRP. Testing of other protein targets identified by proteomics is ongoing and we expect to present more predictive markers in the near future. Combining multiple markers could result in even better prediction of the occurrence of future cardiovascular events. These prognostic markers can be used as intermediate outcomes of clinical trials, may be used as drug targets, and allow prediction of outcome, facilitating tailor-made treatment for each patient. In conclusion, the atherosclerotic plaque contains important prognostic information. It is essential to realize that clinical application of plaque composition can portray a major advance in treatment of advanced atherosclerotic disease. Further research on the clinical application of plaque composition, e.g. by proteomics and prospective plaque imaging studies, must be conducted and should receive high priority to improve the outcome of patients suffering from atherosclerotic disease.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) is a widely accepted approach for malignant and nonmalignant hematopoietic diseases. Unfortunately complications can occur because of the treatment, leading to treatment-related mortality. We studied kidney dysfunction after allogeneic SCT in 2 cohorts of patients: 1 cohort that received a myeloablative SCT (n=363) and 1 cohort that received a nonmyeloablative SCT (n=150). Acute renal failure, defined as doubling of serum creatinine from baseline within 100 days, developed in 50% of patients receiving a myeloablative SCT and in 33% of patients receiving a nonmyeloablative SCT. Only in the myeloablative cohort was dialysis required in 1% of patients. Overall survival after 6 months was 75% in patients receiving a myeloablative SCT and 84% in patients receiving a nonmyeloablative SCT. Mortality was higher in patients with acute renal failure. This was not caused by acute renal failure per se, but by complications or relapse with high mortality associated with more severe acute renal failure. Acute renal failure in the absence of a complication or relapse was probably caused by cyclosporine and these patients had similar survival as patients without acute renal failure. The incidence of chronic kidney disease, defined as persistence of a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of <60 ml/min/1.73 m2, was 20% after 5 years in the myeloablative cohort and in 22% after 4 years in the nonmyeloablative cohort. Risk factors for chronic kidney disease were lower GFR at baseline, female gender and higher age. Overall survival was 60% after 5 years in patients receiving a myeloablative SCT and 66% after 4 years in patients receiving a nonmyeloablative SCT. Survival was not influenced by chronic kidney disease, but the reason for this might be that follow-up was still too short. SCT nephropathy, also known as bone marrow transplantation nephropathy, conditioning-associated HUS or radiation nephritis is a microangiopathic condition that can lead to chronic kidney disease and kidney failure. It is characterized by an increase in creatinine, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and hypertension, occurring typically 6-12 months after SCT. SCT nephropathy is a rare syndrome that occurred in 2% of patients who received high dose total body irradiation in the myeloablative conditioning regimen. However, it is a very important syndrome, because it was the only cause of end-stage kidney disease in this cohort. Patients with renal dysfunction at baseline, defined as a GFR of <60 ml/min/1.73 m2 can safely receive a standard nonmyeloablative SCT. Although the occurrence of chronic kidney disease in this group is higher compared to patients with normal renal function, cyclosporine dose, complications and mortality rate are similar. In conclusion, acute renal failure and chronic kidney disease are common complications after SCT. Acute renal failure without other complications is reversible and does not lead to impaired survival. The outcome of patients with chronic kidney disease with longer follow-up is not clear yet. Management of chronic kidney disease according to the National Kidney foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines hopefully slows progression of chronic kidney disease to kidney failure.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Carotid artery intima-media thickness (CIMT) is widely used in observational and intervention studies. Despite the long history and its frequent use there is little uniformity in the measurement of CIMT. This diversity may have substantial effects on published results of studies and on the interpretation thereof. In this thesis we aimed to study several methodological aspects of CIMT measurements to facilitate an evidence-based decision making with respect to CIMT measurements. In chapter 2, two online techniques to measure CIMT, an automated RF approach and a manual B-mode approach, were compared. CIMT measured with B-mode showed stronger relations with established risk factors and was more strongly associated with risk of future cardiovascular events whereas in individuals with a thin CIMT (<0.9 mm) automated RF provided stronger relations with risk factors and stronger associations with future events, indicating that type of study population and expected presence of local atherosclerotic abnormalities should be considered in the choice of technique. The pros and cons of two different CIMT outcome measures (the mean common CIMT and mean maximum CIMT) were considered in chapter 3. As most parameters (apart from logistics) between both measures were equal, the decisive aspect that remained was the congruency of the result of the outcome measure with event data. The congruency showed a complementary value of both measures, favoring the use of both measures. Since the measurement of the mean maximum CIMT also includes measurement of the mean common CIMT, the balance tips towards the mean maximum CIMT measurement as the choice of outcome. Completeness of CIMT data at different walls, segments and angles of the carotid artery was studied in a population with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and in a population with mixed dyslipidemia (MD) in chapter 4. With the current ultrasound protocols and equipment it is possible to obtain high levels of complete CIMT information from nearly all walls, segments and angles. Apart from the study population, the completeness depended on the body mass index and waist circumference. In chapter 5 ultrasound protocols were compared on reproducibility, progression rates of CIMT and treatment effects in four different study populations. Ultrasound protocols that included measurements of both walls at multiple (? 2) angles for both the mean common CIMT and the mean maximum CIMT overall provided the best balance of the parameters mentioned above. In chapter 6, we showed that the quantification of the effect of an intervention did not appear to be affected by the type of reading approach (reading in batch versus reading in consecutive order). However, the absolute observed CIMT progression rates might be biased in a non-batch approach. Finally, all findings were put in perspective and implications of choices on sample size were discussed in chapter 8. If one aims to design a study with a sample size that is large enough to demonstrate a statistically significant effect of the intervention on both the mean maximum CIMT as the mean common CIMT, the differences in magnitude of progression rate and precision of the estimates of both outcome measures should be considered.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The driving forces for fundamental research in colloid science are the ability to manage the material properties of colloids and to unravel the forces that play a role between colloids to be able to control and understand the processes where colloids play an important role. Therefore we are searching for colloidal materials with specific physical properties to better understand our surrounding world.Until recently research in colloid science was mainly focused on spherical (isotropic) particles. Monodisperse spherical colloids serve as a model system as they exhibit similar phase behaviour as molecular and atomic systems. Nevertheless, in many cases the spherical shape is not sufficient to reach the desired research goals. Recently the more complex synthesis methods of anisotropic model colloids has strongly developed. This thesis should be regarded as a contribution to this research area. Anisotropic colloids can be used as a building block for complex structures and are expected not only to lead to the construction of full photonic band gap materials. They will also serve as new, more realistic, models systems for their molecular analogues. Therefore the term ‘molecular colloids” is sometimes used to qualify these anisotropic colloidal particles. In the introduction of this thesis, we give an overview of the main synthesis techniques for anisotropic colloids. Chapter 2 describes the method of etching silicon wafers to construct monodisperse silicon rods. They subsequently were oxidized and labeled (coated) with a fluorescent silica layer. The first explorative phase behaviour of these silica rods was studied. The particles showed a nematic ordering in charge stabilized suspensions. Chapter 3 describes the synthesis of colloidal gold rods and the (mesoporous) silica coating of gold rods. Chapter 4 describes the physical and optical properties of these particles when thermal energy is added. This is compared to the case where the particles are irradiated with femtosecond laserpulses of variable wavelengths. We show that we can grow a silica layer on the gold rods with controllable thickness. In future this can be used to control the alignment of the gold rods a 3D crystal in an electric field. The silica coated gold rods can be used in optical switches. In chapter 4 we show to have a very local control of changing the aspect ratio of gold rods by irradiation with femtosecond laserpulses of 82 MHz with a threshold of ~ 2 picojoules to deform the particles. In chapter 5 and 6 we show how, starting from spherical particles, dimers (dumbbells), trimers and multimers can be formed by controlled aggregation. Chapter 7 finally shows an overview of syntheses where the pores of (mainly) silica particles is decreased. We show that the pores of the given particles could be decreased from macroporous to (ultra)microporous. Through a full control of pore size particles can selectively be filled with materials (for instance a drug) and be controllably closed. This opens a route for synthesis of particles that can be used as molecular filters or in biomedical applications such as smart drug delivery.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Misfolding of proteins from their soluble form into highly insoluble fibrillar deposits can lead to (non-)neurodegenerative disorders or systemic amyloidosis. This class of diseases (for which no therapy is available yet) is called amyloid diseases. Amyloid refers to the extracellular proteinaceous deposits consisting of fibrils. Fibrils are oligomers of misfolded peptides/proteins which are characterized by folding into beta-pleated sheets. A well accepted approach for the interference with beta-sheet formation is the design of soluble beta-sheet mimetics that are able to disrupt the hydrogen bonding network which ultimately leads to the disassembly of fibrils and aggregates. One prominent disease related to the formation of extracellular amyloid is type 2 diabetes. The western aging population shows a dramatic increase in the number of diabetic patients. Type 2 diabetes is characterized by the extracellular deposition of the misfolded human Islet Amyloid PolyPeptide (hIAPP or amylin) in the pancreatic islets of Langerhans and is found in 90% of the diabetic patients. The first part of this thesis describes the development of newly designed soluble beta-sheet breaker peptides based on human amylin. Several approaches towards such beta-sheet breaker peptides were investigated. In chapter 2, the synthesis, spectroscopic analysis and aggregation behaviour, of several backbone-modified amylin(20-29) derivatives is described. Three modified amide bonds at alternate positions were introduced such as ester bonds, N-butylated amides and peptoids using amylin(20-29) as core sequence. In chapter 3, the synthesis of the chiral peptoid building block of L-isoleucine, the solid phase synthesis of the peptoid and retropeptoid sequences of amylin(20-29), and the structural analysis of these amylin derivatives in solution by infrared spectroscopy, circular dichroism and transmission electron microscopy is described. Chapters 4 and 5 deal with the incorporation of a single beta-aminoethane sulfonyl amide moiety or an aminooxy moiety in the highly amyloidogenic peptide sequence amylin(20-29) and its subsequent benzylation featuring the Mitsunobu reaction. Chapter 6 deals with the synthesis of the enantiomer of the L-depsipeptide as was described in chapter 2. In chapter 7, aggregation studies of native amylin(1-37) and derivatives using NMR-spectroscopy are described. The role of histidine 18 in full-length amylin was studied to reveal the initial changes in secondary structure and fibril formation. In chapter 8, design of a covalent triangular shaped molecule with amyloidogenic Abeta(16-22) as a repeating unit and functioning as a cross recognition motif, is described. Identical triangular shaped molecules might be capable to induce spontaneous self-assembly into nanospheres like viral capsids or triangular shaped tubular nanostructures. Chapter 9 describes an alternative approach towards the synthesis of triangular shaped peptide constructs as described in chapter 8. Herein, an efficient and facile synthesis of an N-azido/C-alkynyl Abeta(16-22) derivative is described. Since peptides containing both an azide and an alkyne moiety can be polymerized using the microwave-assisted Cu(I)-catalyzed 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction, this synthetic approach was chosen to obtain cyclic Abeta16-22) oligomers.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Antidepressants have shown to be effective in the treatment of depression and anxiety by reducing symptoms, as well as the risk of relapse and recurrence. Yet, several obstacles have been acknowledged in the process of adequate diagnosis and treatment of patients with these diseases: underrecognition of the health problem by the patient, underconsultation among patients who need treatment, failure to recognise and diagnose the problem by the physician, failure to prescribe drug treatment for those who need so, and eventually, on the part of the patient, not taking the drug as instructed. This thesis aims to understand why patients deviate from the prescribed and advised treatment with antidepressant drugs. The studies presented are build upon the framework of the course of drug taking consisting of three phases, namely initiation, execution and discontinuation of therapy. In this thesis, we explore patients’ considerations and decisions, based on the three phases within the course of taking antidepressants. Initiation of antidepressant drug treatment has hardly been addressed in research. This thesis showed that over one in four patients who receive a first-time antidepressant prescription appeared to decline treatment; they either do not initiate drug taking or do not persist antidepressant use for longer than two weeks. Declining a first-time antidepressant prescription was more common in patients who consult their physician for a non-specific indication, in elderly and non-western immigrants. Illness perceptions and severity, treatment needs and concerns, and patients’ views on information revealed to be important factors in the initiation of antidepressant drug taking. Fundamental in exploring the execution phase of antidepressant therapy are changes in patients’ attitude towards antidepressant treatment in response to the experiences while taking them. Health beliefs and illness severity at start showed to influence patients’ decisions about antidepressant drug taking. Patients who discontinued treatment some months after start perceived the physician’s role as limited, both during initiation and execution of treatment. They seemed to be less involved in decision making, and often appeared to have little confidence in their physician. Discontinuers were often unconvinced about the necessity of using an antidepressant, and appeared to have a strong desire to discontinue treatment. Finally, assessing whether patients taper treatment as opposed to abrupt discontinuation is important to understand patients’ behaviour during discontinuation of antidepressant therapy. We showed that one in five patients abruptly discontinue their therapy. Abrupt discontinuation caused a larger increase in the number of discontinuation symptoms than tapering. Of all patients, only one-third used a physician-made tapering schedule. We recommend healthcare professionals to inform patients of the pros and cons of taking or not taking antidepressant medication, involve patients in the treatment decision, reflect progress with treatment over time, and elicit considerations as to whether continue or discontinue drug taking. In addition, we suggest that research could systematically incorporate patients’ perspectives on medicines. Evaluation of patients’ experienced advantages and disadvantages of drug taking may contribute to the understanding of why patients take certain decisions regarding their medication use.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Developments in Veterinary Medical Education : Intentions, perceptions, learning processes and outcomes'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['The past decennia, veterinary medical education worldwide has gone through some rapid and major developments. Motivation for these developments were, among others, the explosion of (bio) medical knowledge, the related problem of curriculum overload and the mismatch between university and the veterinary profession to which alumni missed competencies essential for future (economic) career success. The developments in veterinary medical education can be characterised by a transition from mostly teacher centred education towards more student centred education and by more attention being paid in curricula for generic competency training, such as academic/ scientific, communication and business skills. The research conducted in this thesis aimed at gaining more knowledge and insight into veterinary curriculum developments. The central question was how students, teachers and alumni of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Utrecht University, the Netherlands have experienced their student centred curriculum with substantial attention to education in generic competencies. Studies in this thesis focus on seminar leaning, the research internship and preparation for professional practice. Specific research questions, to help answer the main question, were formulated: 1. How are different elements of student-centred learning and the acquisition of generic competencies incorporated in the new curriculum design? 2. What are students’ and teachers’ experiences with seminar group learning? What happens during seminar group sessions? Which factors affect learning in this environment? 3. What are students’ experiences with the research internship? What are the strengths and weaknesses of students’ research reports? Which factors affect learning in this environment? 4. What are alumni’s experiences with the curriculum they completed and how well do they think it has prepared them for professional practice? The studies were conducted from process-directed and outcome-directed perspectives by use of a variety of research methods and resources, such as document analysis, development of an assessment instrument, questionnaire surveys to examine students’, teachers’ and alumni’s perceptions and experiences, and observational techniques to explore students’ and teachers’ behaviour in a group learning environment. The results show that the design of the newly developed curricula shows aspects of student centred education. However, a clear educational vision and assessment methods receive relatively less attention. The other studies show that both matches and mismatches exist between what was intended with the curricula and what actually happened in the curricula and how it was experienced. The seminars were less interactive than intended; not much interaction existed and both students and teachers had mixed feelings about the value of interaction within seminars. The research internship was highly appreciated by veterinary students. The quality of the supervision and the social and intellectual climate appeared to be crucial factors influencing students’ learning during the internship. The research reports, as an outcome measurement, reflected on the competency levels of the students and both strengths and weaknesses of the reports could be identified. Research further showed that alumni of the newly developed curriculum felt better prepared for practice both for specific and generic competencies although they also experienced lacks in their training, especially practical skills, communication skills and business management skills.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Demanding Dynamics - Demand articulation of intermediary organisations in emerging pharmaceutical innovations'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['User involvement in emerging technological fields is carried by so-called demand articulation processes. These demand articulation processes are interactive learning processes in which stakeholders try to address what they perceive as important characteristics of, and to unravel preferences for an emerging innovation. The focus lies on intermediary user organisations, i.e. organised stakeholders that facilitate interactions between users and one or more other actors. In the thesis the following research question is answered: How to understand the demand articulation processes of intermediary user organisations in the context of emerging pharmaceutical technologies? Demand articulation processes are studied in the context of three intermediary user organisations using the ‘event history analysis’. The three Dutch organisations, which are dealing with emerging pharmaceutical innovations are: the Steering committee on orphan drugs, the Breast cancer association, and the Neuromuscular disease association. For the three studied intermediary user organisations it is found that demand articulation processes inside intermediaries can be regarded as an interconnected ensemble of first-order and second-order learning loops. Differences in characterisation of these loops related to distinct contexts and organisations lead to the identification of several specific demand articulation mechanisms, such as ‘management of expectations’, ‘network building’ and ‘active case building’. The intermediary user organisations apply different kinds of interface strategies towards the actors they represent and other relevant parties. The represented actors, subdivided in the ‘silent majority’ and the ‘patient champions’ merit from the representation of them without interaction to quick, passionate calls for action (‘sudden anxiety’) and strategies focusing on longer-term commitment. Concerning interactions with other relevant parties, interface strategies range from asked advocacy in the form of consultative presentation to unasked advocacy, and from forceful to tentative strategies. These strategies were most of the time not the result of ad hoc actions but had a proactive and long-term focus. The analysis showed that intermediaries tried to shape emerging technologies in such a way that the resulting innovations meet the needs and wishes of the users they represent. The identified demand articulation mechanisms and interface strategies illustrate the way in which they attempt to achieve this. Moreover, these organisations are faced with three dilemmas: 1) Positioning: the confrontation of intermediary’s self-position and the position other actors assign to them reveals possible problems with the neutrality of intermediaries. 2) Representation: for intermediaries it is essential to speak on behalf of their members and picture their demands in a representative way. In this way it can enhance the democratic value of the organisations’ decision-making and input in debates. 3) The need to be proactive: in this way, intermediaries can better anticipate the course of the debate. Moreover, by creating a vision of future technologies in an early phase empowers the intermediary. These three dilemmas show that intermediary user organisations play a precarious role in demand articulation in the context of emerging technologies. However, if these dilemmas can be overcome, these organisations could and will play a central and crucial role in (democratically) governing future oriented technology analysis.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Here we described the use of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) as a model to obtain insights into commitment to the mesoderm and endoderm lineages and the early steps in human cardiac cell differentiation by means of whole-genome temporal expression profiling. Furthermore, we used it as an approach to identify new genes that may be associated with (abnormal) human heart development. This was the first detailed temporal transcriptional profiling of hESCs differentiating towards a specific cell type to be reported, most likely due to the lack of efficient protocols for directed differentiation. It is important to profile the expression changes that occur before and during cell commitment and to identify the key genes involved during the critical time points of the differentiation process. Furthermore it allowed us to identify novel genes that are enriched in cardiomyocytes. One of several novel cardiac-enriched genes that were identified in the microarray analysis was cloned and studied further. We mainly focused on unravelling the function of this gene. We showed that this gene encodes a cytoskeletal protein that is actin-associated and binds to ?-actinin2 at the Z-disc of sarcomeres. Hence, we named the gene Cytoskeletal Heart-enriched Actin-associated Protein (CHAP). Furthermore, we identified and knocked down the CHAP orthologues in zebrafish which lead to impaired heart and skeletal muscle development and function, indicating an important role for chap in muscle. Since heart failure is the number one cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide, the identification of new components, the precise molecular mechanisms of the Z-disc and its role in signaling has become critical for understanding the regulation of cardiac function and disease. Furthermore, we describe the identification of another novel heart-enriched gene which was annotated as steroid 5?-reductase 2-like 2 (SRD5A2L2). We investigated the expression of this gene during embryonic development and provide the first indication that steroid metabolism might be involved in muscle development. Finally, we show that Asb2, a member of the Ankyrin-repeat and SOCS-box containing family which we also identified in our previous microarray study, is expressed during early mouse heart and skeletal muscle development. Our findings represent novel disease candidate genes that could be involved in (cardio) myopathies. Further studies on the function of CHAP, Srd5a4 and Asb-2 will shed more light on their possible role in disease. Since the molecular mechanisms of cardiogenesis are conserved in zebrafish, mouse and human, we could use the zebrafish as a model system to investigate the importance of novel genes such as Srd5a4 and Asb-2 in cardiac development. In addition, making use of DNA-databases of congenital heart disease patients such as the ”CONgenital COR vitia” registry (CONCOR), which contains DNA of over 4000 dutch patients, will allow us to screen for mutations in our discovered candidate genes.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Growth monitoring in infancy and childhood has been part of preventive child health programs for more than a century in both developed and underdeveloped countries. It is a popular tool for defining health and nutritional status of children. An important goal of growth monitoring is to identify, at an early stage, genetic disorders, diseases or other conditions that manifest themselves through an abnormal growth. Despite the longstanding and wide acceptance of growth monitoring, not much was known about the diagnostic performance of growth monitoring. This thesis presents referral criteria for length (height), weight and body mass index (BMI) that are able to detect, at an early stage, many children with growth-related conditions at the account of only a limited number of children that do not have a condition. For this purpose, we studied growth of children with Turner’s syndrome, celiac disease, cystic fibrosis, (hypernatraemic) dehydration, obesity and children from the general population. New growth charts are needed to apply the referral criteria. Growth charts for twins were not available, while it is known that the growth pattern of twins differs from that of singletons during infancy. Therefore, we established growth charts for monozygotic and dizygotic twins aged 0-2.5 years. Also, we presented a new reference chart for weight loss of breast-fed infants in the first weeks of life. This chart is needed for the detection of neonates with hypernatraemic dehydration. Furthermore, the thesis presents estimates of the prevalence of childhood overweight and obesity based on BMI. In the Netherlands, the prevalence of childhood overweight and obesity rose between the year 1980 and 1997. Prevalence rose even faster between 1997 and 2003. On average, 14.5% of the boys and 17.5% of the girls were overweight in 2003. More girls than boys were overweight and obese at all ages. A complicating factor in the use of BMI as a measure of overweight in children is the presence of height bias. With BMI, tall children are proportionally more overweight than short children. The odds ratio of overweight in tall boys aged 4-14 years compared to short boys is 4.6. This ratio is 3.8 for tall girls aged 4-12 years of age compared to short girls. This thesis proposes an alternative definition for overweight. In conclusion, this is the first evidence-based investigation of referral criteria in growth monitoring. Valid and efficient referral criteria based on growth are possible. Proper application of these rules in growth monitoring leads to early identification of children with growth-related conditions.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Background The pectoralis major flap is frequently being applied as a pedicled flap for head and neck reconstruction. To reduce donor-site morbidity, muscle-preserving methods using only a segment of this muscle for transplantation, were described. The nerve supply to the clavicular part of the pectoralis major muscle was investigated in order to maintain its function at the donor site. This function and the clinical outcome at the receptor site were tested postoperatively. To determine its feasibility as a segmental microsurgical free flap, the length and diameter of the vascular pedicle of the pectoralis major muscle were investigated next. Finally, our clinical experience with this free flap was presented. Materials and methods Surgically relevant features of the clavicular part of the pectoralis major muscle and its nerve supply were studied by anatomical dissections on formalin-fixed and fresh cadavers. A new surgical technique was then clinically applied for head and neck reconstruction. Postoperatively, muscle activity of the remaining clavicular and abdominal muscle parts was determined objectively and subjectively. The overall rate of complications, major complications, and the final outcome at the receptor sites were studied after 54 pedicled segmental pectoralis major island flaps. Possible risk factors were assessed. Seventeen anatomical dissections of the vascular pedicle were performed in formalin-fixed cadavers to determine its feasibility as a segmental free flap. The length of the pedicle, its arterial diameter, and its entry point into the muscle were noted. Segmental pectoralis major free flaps were then clinically applied for reconstruction of craniofacial defects in five patients. Results A separate nerve innervates the clavicular and upper medial sternocostal parts of the pectoralis major muscle. Based on our anatomical findings we proposed a surgical technique for transfer of the pectoralis major island flap through a tunnel in the deltopectoral groove. Postoperatively, the electromyogram proved preservation of innervation of 16 of the 17 clavicular parts. Complications at the receptor site were observed after 21 of the 54 operations (0.39). Eleven of these cases (0.52) required repeated surgery. Final outcome was successful in 49 of the 54 operations (0.91). The length of the vascular pedicle of the sternocostal part was 6.6 cm. The external arterial diameter was 1.8 mm. This entry point was located a mean of 8.8 cm caudal to the clavicular line. After application as a free flap in five patients, total flap loss occurred in one patient and repeated surgery was required in another. Final flap outcome was favorable in four patients. Conclusions Transfer of the pectoralis major island flap to the head and neck area through a tunnel in the deltopectoral groove is a muscle-preserving procedure that maintains maximal donor-site function and morphology. This technique is reliable with clinical results comparable to conventional techniques, in addition to function preservation at the donor site. The length and arterial diameter of the vascular pedicle of the sternocostal part are sufficient for microvascular anastomosis. The segmental pectoralis major free flap is a useful and justifiable adjunct to the microsurgical armamentarium for flat or wide craniofacial defects.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Carbohydrates are more and more of interest in drug design as they are important mediators in a whole range of biological processes. Because of the low affinity of carbohydrates for their receptors, multivalent ligand presentation was introduced. Multivalent compounds were shown to improve the affinity towards lectins, AB5 toxins and bacteria. In this thesis both the design and synthesis of new glycodendrimers is described. A solid phase strategy was developed to speed up the synthesis of glycosides. Selective protection and deprotection steps were performed on-bead, followed by on-bead glycosylation. Simple glycosides were obtained however the yield was poor. As key step for the synthesis of a galabiose building block an enzymatic approach was applied. The product from an enzymatic cleavage was converted into the desired galabiose unit using simple synthetic chemistry. The obtained building block was used for the preparation of galabiose dendrimers which showed to be capable for inhibition of S. suis binding using a heamagglutination inhibition assay, a clear multivalency effect was observed. To inhibit Cholera Toxin binding, mono- to octavalent GM1- and galactose-dendrimers were synthesized. Both series of compounds showed a dramatic increase in inhibition potency to block CT binding in an inhibition assay. Especially the tetra- and octavalent compounds showed an increased affinity up to 47.500 per ligand. The tetra- and octavalent galactose-dendrimers showed an inhibition capacity which can compete with the natural ligand and thereby opens routes for medical applications. Finally flow-through microarray technology was introduced to study multivalent interactions. Amine terminated mannose-dendrimers were synthesized and covalently attached to a porous microarray chip surface. Protein binding to the chip surface was observed in time for the mannose binding lectins ConA and GNA, only GNA showed to benefit from a multivalent ligand display. Curve fitting was used to obtain Kd values for these binding events. The microarray technology was also successfully applied in an inhibition assay with soluble monovalent inhibitors.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Thyroid hormones have effect on almost every organ system in the body. This explains the wide range of clinical manifestations of primary hypothyroidism in dogs. The signs and symptoms are often nonspecific and the disease onset is insidious. It may therefore take a long time before hypothyroidism is diagnosed. On the other hand, canine hypothyroidism is frequently diagnosed erroneously because many non-thyroidal factors (e.g. drug therapy, concurrent disease) may result in a low plasma total thyroxine (TT4) concentration. The introduction of homologous immunoassays for measuring canine plasma thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations in the 1990s enabled the assessment of the canine pituitary-thyroid axis by measuring the hormone pair T4 and TSH, with the diagnosis of primary hypothyroidism being established on the basis of a low plasma TT4 concentration and a high plasma TSH concentration. However, in studies using the TSH-stimulation test as gold standard, it appeared that plasma TSH concentrations were not elevated in as many as a third of dogs with primary hypothyroidism. The main aim of the studies described in this thesis was to test the hypothesis that primary hypothyroidism leads to adenohypophyseal alterations that may explain the occurrence of low plasma TSH concentrations. It was hoped that these studies would also bring about better ways to diagnose primary hypothyroidism in dogs. From the studies described in this thesis the following main conclusions can be drawn: • In dogs with suspected hypothyroidism, in which measurement of plasma concentrations of thyroxine (TT4 and/or fT4) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) provides inconclusive results, measurement of thyroid 99mTcO4- uptake can discriminate between primary hypothyroidism and non-thyroidal illness. • In healthy dogs, TSH is secreted in a pulsatile manner with only small fluctuations. In dogs with primary hypothyroidism, the TSH pulses are more pronounced and may occasionally result in plasma TSH concentrations within the reference range for euthyroid dogs. • Primary hypothyroidism in dogs is associated with elevated plasma concentrations of growth hormone (GH) and of the growth factor IGF-I. This explains some of the physical changes of canine hypothyroidism, mimicking the syndrome of GH excess (acromegaly). • In contrast to healthy dogs, dogs with primary hypothyroidism respond to the administration of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) with an increase in plasma GH concentrations. • The pituitary function of dogs with primary hypothyroidism is characterized by: - Initially high plasma TSH concentrations that decrease with time to levels that may fall within the reference range for healthy dogs. A gradual loss of TSH response to suprapituitary stimulation precedes this lowering of basal plasma TSH concentrations. - Development of GH hypersecretion, persisting with time. - Hyposecretion of prolactin (PRL) in neutered bitches and PRL hypersecretion in sexually intact bitches during the luteal phase of the estrus cycle. • Pituitary enlargement with time, associated with thyrotrope hyperplasia, large vacuolated “thyroid deficiency cells”, and cells double-staining for TSH and GH.'],\n",

Children who persist to wheeze after the age of three are at risk of developing asthma, but recognition of these persistent wheezers is difficult due to several heterogeneous wheezing phenotypes. Gene expression profiles did not only differentiate between transient and persistent wheezers, but these two distinct wheezing phenotypes also share some common pro-inflammatory genes, such as DUSP2, JunB, TNFAIP3, TNFSF13B and LILRB2. Three genes, STAT1, TLR7 and PTGER2 which appeared to differentiate between the transient and persistent wheezers proved to distinguish these two phenotypes in a prospective cohort study, thereby recognizing those children at risk to develop asthma. Also, when wheezing children were compared with healthy controls, the increased expression of several genes encoding for heat shock proteins (hsp) was found. These stress proteins play an important role in the regulation of inflammatory processes and interestingly, their activation secludes both innate as well as adaptive immune responses. To elucidate the mechanism on how hsp exert a regulatory role we studied the effects of stimulation of CBMCs with human hsp60. The cord blood mononuclear cells are thought to be naive cells, but the immune regulatory capacities of hsp are thought to be innate and might therefore exert certain reactions in CBMCs. Not only did CBMCs proliferate in response to hsp60 but this recognition led to the induction of suppressive, FOXP3 positive T cells. These suppressive FOXP3 positive T cells are referred to as regulatory T cells. This induction of suppressive, regulatory T cells is of great interest when exploring new opportunities for therapeutic strategies in atopic diseases. A cytokine known for its immunosuppressive effect is TGF-Beta. To get more insight in the pathophysiology of the induction of regulatory T cells and the influence of the differentiation status of T cells in this process, a study was performed in which naïve CBMCs of healthy donors were stimulated with TGF-Beta in vitro. The CBMCs were stimulated either unskewed, or skewed towards a TH1 or TH2 type. This skewing process seemed to be of great influence on the effects of TGF-Beta, since CBMCs skewed towards a TH2 profile were far less responsive to the influence of TGF-Beta compared to CBMCs skewed towards a TH1 profile. This implicates that the mechanisms involved in regulation varies, depending at least in part, to the cell type which is targeted. Hsp are also capable of inducing regulatory T cells in CBMCs of healthy donors. The role of hsp in atopic diseases is unclear, but a few studies have shown that increased levels of hsp (hsp70 in this particular study) can be detected in asthma. We were curious whether hsp were also capable of eliciting a response in PBMCs of atopic children with active allergic symptoms. The PBMCs of atopic children recognized hsp which induced pro-inflammatory autoreactive T cells in vitro. The implication for future therapeutic perspectives have to be further investigated.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Cryptococcus neoformans is a human pathogen that mainly causes disease in immuno-compromised individuals. The yeast cells or basidiospores spread through dissemination from environmental sources, for example pigeon droppings and dust, and causes a systemic infection, cryptococcosis. A severe clinical manifestation of cryptococcosis is meningo-encephalitis, but also infection of other organs like the lungs, and skin have been reported. Since the increased incidence of AIDS due to the spread of the HIV virus, especially in third world countries, C. neoformans has become one of the most emerging opportunistic pathogens in hospitals. In fact, it is one of the leading causes of death in patients suffering from AIDS. The incidence of cryptococcosis is also increasing in the Western world especially due to use of immunosuppressive drugs and increasing numbers of organ transplantations. The surface of the C. neoformans yeast cell can be surrounded by a thick capsule. This capsule is mainly composed of the polysaccharides GXM and GalXM. GalXM consists of the monosaccharides mannose, xylose and glucuronic acid, whereas GXM contains galactose, mannose and xylose. The capsule is critical for pathogenesis and harbors components that have immuno-modulatory properties. This and the physical properties of the capsule makes it a barrier for the immune system to reach receptors on the cell wall. Mutants have been isolated that have an acapsular phenotype. These mutants of the serotype A strain of C. neoformans are called CAP10, CAP59, CAP60 and CAP64. CAP67 is a serotype D mutant strain. The genes that are affected in these strains have been identified, but the exact role of the CAP genes is not clear. In this Thesis biosynthesis of the capsule and its role in pathogenesis was studied. This was done by investigating the content and the structure of the capsule, by looking at the genes involved in capsule biogenesis and by investigating the effect of mutants affected in capsule biogenesis on human dendritic cells. This is not only interesting from a fundamental point of view, it may also identify targets that can be used to improve treatment of cryptococcosis in the future.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Abstract of the thesis “Effects of heart failure management programmes” The main purpose of the studies presented in this thesis, was to assess whether an intensive 1-year intervention at a heart failure clinic for patients with heart failure, NYHA classification III or IV, reduces the incidence of hospitalisation for worsening heart failure and/or all cause mortality and improves functional status and quality of life at acceptable costs and whether the observed effects may be (partly) attributable to beneficial changes in patient adherence to drug therapy. Important differences with many previous studies were that our heart failure clinic was directed by a combination of a clinician and a heart failure nurse and that the study was performed in a country with a relatively strong primary care health-care system. In a systematic review in the beginning of the thesis, the results of previous studies on heart failure management programmes are reviewed critically and their applicability to countries, such as the Netherlands, with well-structured primary care facilities is discussed. In the core chapters of the thesis the main results of the Deventer-Alkmaar Heart Failure study (DEAL-HF study) are presented first: the number of admissions for worsening heart failure and/or all-cause deaths in the intervention group was lower than in the control group (23 vs. 47; relative risk(RR) 0.49; 95% confidence interval 0.30 to 0.81; p= 0.001). There also was an improvement of the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in the intervention group (plus 2.6%) compared with a decrease in the usual care group (minus 3.1%; p=0.004). Patients in the intervention group were hospitalised for a total of 359 days, compared with 644 days for those in the usual care group. Beneficial effects were also observed on NYHA functional class, quality of life, self-care behaviour and health care costs. Then, several sub-studies within the DEAL-HF population are presented. First, we assessed the effect of the heart failure management programme on adherence of prescribers and patients to the medication regimes: beta-blocker dosaging and the number of patients using spironolactone increased. This may have been an important contributor to the observed improved clinical outcomes. Then we investigated the correlation between the change in a biochemical parameter, NT-proBNP, and the change in quality of life and functional class during the follow-up of the main study. Long-term changes in NT-proBNP were indeed accompanied by similar changes in quality of life, functional status and echo parameters. Finally we studied the costs of the heart failure management programme in relation to the observed effects. This more detailed analysis of the costs and effects of the heart failure management programme studied in the DEAL HF study confirms that such a programme exerts beneficial clinical benefit and saves costs.'],\n",

Several strategies have emerged to evaluate and optimize patients before surgery, aiming to minimize the risk of complications. In this thesis two different strategies for preoperative evaluation and optimization were studied: outpatient preoperative evaluation clinics (OPE clinics) and preoperative interventions embedded in clinical pathways for gastrointestinal surgery. At an OPE clinic the anaesthetist timely evaluates the preoperative condition of patients to asses the risk on complications during and after surgery. Formerly, this evaluation was performed by internists and surgeons or by the anaesthetist just before he started anaesthesia. The implementation of OPE clinics was evaluated by a nationwide survey with questionnaires. Cooperation of anaesthetists was most frequently mentioned as facilitating factor for implementation of OPE clinics. Lack of finance was most frequently reported as limiting factor, but significantly more often in hospitals without than in with an OPE clinic (p'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The development of multicellular organisms is characterized by complex processes that progressively transform essentially a single cell into a creature with complicated structures and highly specialized functions. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster provides an excellent model system to investigate these principles of life in great detail. Over the past few decades, Drosophila has been used to investigate and elucidate fundamental aspects that underlie the mechanisms described above. Since this research mainly involved large-scale analysis of genes, many principles are now understood at the gene level. However, it is nowadays clear that transcript abundances no not necessarily correlate with protein expression levels and since the latter determine the complexity of cells it is the ultimate goal to investigate and understand these processes directly at the protein level. The maturation of proteomics-based mass spectrometric techniques allows capturing the identity of many proteins in a single experiment. The primary goal of the work described in this thesis focused on gaining insights into the dynamics of early embryonic development of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster at the protein level by combining stable isotope labeling with high-accuracy mass spectrometry. We have developed a quantitative proteomic approach utilizing in vivo 15N-labeling of fruit flies with stable isotopes combined with extensive analysis by LC-MS/MS which has permitted the relative quantitation of thousands of proteins during early embryonic development. This provided insight into the production, stability and modification of individual proteins, while discrepancies between transcriptional profiles and protein dynamics indicated novel control mechanisms in genome activation during early fly development. Differential regulation of numerous proteins was observed and allowed the classification of these proteins into specialized classes. Although this approach shows its strength in identifying and quantitating proteins, some drawbacks include suboptimal labeling and lack of appropriate software for data processing. To overcome these issues, alternative objectives were explored in the work described in this thesis and aimed at developing methods to optimize, improve or facilitate the quantitative analysis of multiple proteins in a single experiment. Metabolic labeling with suboptimal (<98%) 15N-enrichments negatively affects protein identification and quantitation which was discovered by the systematic investigation of two independent 15N-labeled datasets. To overcome or compensate these shortcomings we have developed methods that can be applied to qualitative and quantitative 15N-labeled data. Although metabolic labeling produces most accurate quantitative data, it is not always feasible to incorporate an internal standard metabolically into an organism. So-called label-free techniques allow the quantitation of proteins in two or more samples without the need of using an internal standard. By directly comparing protein expression levels obtained by metabolic labeling based on stable isotope 15N-labeling and label-free quantitation based on spectral peak areas we have correlated both approaches and preliminary data suggests that there is a weak positive correlation between these approaches. Taken together, we have presented a powerful comprehensive proteomics approach that we have applied to early embryonic developed of the fruit fly which provided insights into the production, stability and modification of individual proteins during the developing fly.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Esophageal cancer is the 8th most common type of malignancy in the world. For the past decades the incidence of esophageal cancer has rapidly increased, particularly due to a rise in adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. Yet, worldwide the incidence of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is highest. Radical surgical resection of the esophagus and the surrounding lymph nodes offers the best chance for cure. Five-year survival rate after curative surgery is around 35%. The general aim of this thesis is to investigate strategies in the field of surgery (Part I), molecular biology (Part II) and diagnostic imaging (Part III) through which the outcome of patients that undergo esophagectomy for esophageal cancer could be improved. Open esophagectomy is accompanied by significant morbidity, predominantly due to cardiopulmonary complications. Minimally invasive esophagectomy has been introduced to reduce this morbidity. Yet, conventional scopic surgery has several disadvantages for the surgeon, such as 2-dimensional view, a disturbed eye-hand-coordination and less degrees of freedom. Robotic systems have been developed to overcome those disadvantages. In part I of this thesis, the results of robot-assisted thoracoscopic esophagectomy (RTE) have been described. This innovative surgical technique has shown to be technically feasible and was associated with low blood loss and a steep learning curve. The robotic system facilitated a precise dissection along the vital mediastinal structures. The median number of dissected lymph nodes was equal to the open approach, but more than the thoracoscopic approach. The disease-free survival after RTE was comparable to open esophagectomy as well. To confirm our data and to assess if long-term oncologic outcome of RTE is comparable to open esophagectomy, more prospective studies are warranted. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy may improve the outcome of esophagectomy by opposing early metastatic spread. A disadvantage of chemotherapy is that it destructs all proliferating cells, including normal healthy cells leading to toxicity. Recently, therapy has been developed that selectively acts on tumor cells by aiming at molecular characteristics of a tumor. The aim of Part II of this thesis was to identify potential molecular markers for targeted therapy in ESCC. Promising targets in ESCC appear mTOR, VEGF, EGFR, Cyclin D1 and COX-2, since they were frequently immunohistochemically overexpressed in our ESCC tissues. Based on the results of the studies described in Part III of this thesis, we have concluded that there neither seems a role for the routine aqueous contrast swallow examination performed after esophagectomy to assess the integrity of the cervical anastomosis nor for the sentinel node biopsy technique in esophageal cancer patients. Various diagnostic modalities are available for diagnosing and staging esophageal cancer. In addition, several surgical techniques are performed during esophageal cancer surgery. It is unknown in what frequencies these different diagnostic modalities and surgical techniques are currently being applied worldwide in the work-up and treatment of esophageal cancer patients. We have therefore initiated an international survey among surgeons with particular interest in esophageal cancer. Significant differences in applied diagnostic modalities and surgical techniques were detected between low- and high-volume surgeons and between surgeons from different continents.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a functional bowel disease characterized by abdominal pain or discomfort associated with a disordered defecation. No unique pathophysiological mechanism has been identified. It is most likely a multifactorial disease involving alterations in intestinal microbiota composition, intestinal mucosal barrier, serine protease and serotonergic signalling components which may play a role in the visceral hypersensitivity. We showed alterations in microbiota composition including that bifidobacteria and especially Bifidobacterium catenulatum were significantly decreased and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was significantly increased in both small intestinal mucosa-associated samples as in faecal samples of IBS patients compared to healthy controls. If this change in the microbial composition is causal, consequential or merely the result of the IBS symptoms remains unclear. Furthermore we showed that IBS patients have an altered response of the intestinal barrier to NSAIDs. This might expose the mucosa to an abnormal challenge of luminal antigens of dietary and bacterial origin. Protease activated receptor(PAR)-2 activation leads to increased intestinal permeability which promotes hyperalgesia to mechanical distension. We showed in the small intestine increased expression of the PAR-2 agonist, trypsinogen IV expression. Furthermore in the small intestine increased SERT expression and 5-HT content has been shown suggesting higher 5-HT availability which may also contribute to small intestinal visceral hypersensitivity. In the colorectal region, however, abnormalities in serine protease and serotonergic signalling components showed no differences between rectal hypersensitive and normosensitive IBS patients. Irrespective of visceral hypersensitivity state, the serotonergic signalling components are altered in IBS. Low grade inflammation might also play a role in the visceral hypersensitivity of IBS patients due to sensitization of sensory neural endings in the intestine. We have shown that mast cells are significantly more observed in the vicinity of PAR-2 positive neurons than PAR-2 negative neurons in both IBS patients and controls. In conclusion the pathophysiology of visceral hypersensitivity in IBS is multi-factorial including microbiota, intestinal permeability and serotonin and serine protease signalling components however more work has to be done to yield pathogenetic, diagnostic and therapeutic value for IBS patients.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Mycobacteriun avium ssp. paratuberculosis (MAP) is the pathogen that causes paratuberculosis in ruminants worldwide. In Western Europe and the USA it affects up to 30% of cattle herds. In the subclinical stage of paratuberculosis production losses occur and the bacterium is shedded into the environment. In a minority of animals the disease ultimately progresses into a fatal protein loosing enteropathy. To date no vaccine is available for paratuberculosis in cattle Heat shock proteins (Hsp) are evolutionary conserved molecules that have shown to be immunogenic in different stages of bovine paratuberculosis. After natural or experimental infection immune responses to (MAP) Hsp70 protein, predicted to be protective, were predominantly cell mediated. Efficacy of vaccination with MAP Hsp70 using DDA as an adjuvant was studied in a longitudinal study with vaccinated and experimentally infected animals and relevant controls. Immune responses and bacterial shedding were measured for almost 2 years. Single priming of the animals induced an immune response, which clearly differed from that after encounter of the protein during infection. MAP Hsp70 induced IFN-? production was observed in this study, however this was related to the infectious challenge rather than to vaccination. A prominent and prolonged production of antibodies to MAP Hsp70 was restricted to the immunized groups. It correlated well with the observed significantly reduced shedding of bacteria in the immmunized and challenged group, suggesting a role for antibodies in protection. The clear divergence/discrepancy observed in antibody production enables differentiation between vaccinated and non-vaccinated animals even within infected herds which may clearly be an advantage in the application of the MAP Hsp70 vaccine. The use of subunit vaccines implies reduction of MAP specific epitopes hence fine specificity of T- and B cell responses were studied in outbred animals. Th1 cell responses studied in MAP Hsp70 immunized animals identified specificity for 9 epitopes, and part of the epitopes proved to be promiscuous as responses to individual epitopes were detected in up to 82% of the animals (15 different MHC haplotypes) experimentally infected with MAP. Based on recognition by MAP Hsp70 specific monoclonal antibodies and epitope mapping using synthetic peptides of MAP Hsp70 at least two linear B cell epitopes were identified, which were recognised in vaccinated outbred calves and goats as well. This study also provided indications that the Hsp70 protein is present in the bacterial cell wall of MAP and it may be argued that antibodies, induced by vaccination, may bind intact bacteria and play a direct role in the protective effect.. In the course of paratuberculosis and potentially in protection after vaccination regulatory T-cells are likely to play a role. Our studies provided first evidence that cattle CD4+CD25high and CD4+CD25low T cells do not function as regulatory T cells (Treg) The bovine regulatory cell function, as defined by ex vivo suppressive capacity appears to reside in CD14+ monocytes and in the ?? T cell population, major populations present in blood of cattle in contrast to non-ruminant species. The exact mechanism of the suppression observed and Ag specific regulation (MAP Hsp70) has to be addressed in future studies.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Clean water supply and sanitation are regarded as major milestones in medical advances since the 19th century. Production and control of microbiologically safe drinking water has been an important challenge for the drinking water industry ever since. Based on recent progress in scientific literature the group of emerging waterborne pathogens has been changed and extended compared to well known pathogenic diseases in the early days (Cholera, Typhus). Epidemiological studies and outbreak reports have identified persistent protozoa Cryptosporidium and Giardia, but also bacteria such as Campylobacter and pathogenic E. coli and enteroviruses as waterborne pathogens. Quantitative Knowledge on dose-response for these pathogens enabled the introduction of a health based target in microbiological water quality control to minimize the risk of infection. In this thesis studies are presented aimed at quantifying the elimination of pathogenic micro-organisms in water treatment processes. Direct monitoring of these pathogens is not feasible. Monitoring of faecal indicator bacteria E. coli and spores of sulphite-reducing clostridia as process indicators susceptible and resistant to disinfectants in water treatment have been explored as an alternative method. The detection limit of the standard enumeration method for these bacteria was decreased for that reason. Additional methods were required for the water treatment processes slow sand filtration, surface water infiltration and UV disinfection and also for validation of the use of both bacteria as process indicators for elimination of pathogens. Elimination of multiple pre-cultured micro-organisms by disinfection and filtration processes is assessed in challenge tests and from literature studies at different scales. These data are compared with the elimination of indigenous organisms. On the basis of the results of these studies a generic methodology is proposed to assess the elimination capacity of the water treatment of a drinking water facility as input for the mandatory Quantitative Microbial Risk Analysis to evaluate the health based target for safe drinking water introduced in the revised legislation.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Adaptations to training and exercise can be measured in blood, muscle, and bones and are also reflected in behavior. Since equine total muscle mass represents approximately 42% of total body weight, a major role for skeletal muscle in adaptation to training can be expected. The plasticity of skeletal muscle to adapt to changes in activity or in working conditions is extremely high. A comparison between expression profiles of proteins and their corresponding mRNAs in equine skeletal muscle during development, training or disease would provide us with valuable fundamental knowledge on how adaptations to these different stages or interventions take place in this tissue. This thesis describes the expression profiles of myosin heavy chain (MyHC) and Na+,K+-ATPase isoforms in equine skeletal muscles. Besides basal expression levels, adaptations of the different isoforms due to exercise, training or disease were investigated. The data obtained could provide us with important knowledge on the outcome of training and the effects of disease, which in turn could help elucidate the mechanism behind these changes. Furthermore the results may be useful in the diagnostic analysis of a disease, such as LMND. The MyHC is the backbone of the contractile machinery and it comprises 25% of the total protein content in skeletal muscle. The expression of myosin heavy chains is transcriptionally controlled, as individual muscle fibers always express one mRNA isoform, but simultaneously can express two different proteins. This is the result of differences in half life of MyHC mRNA and protein. It is complicated to define adaptations to exercise and training using the MyHC expression as a parameter. It is suggested to measure, next to MyHC fiber type composition, other parameters that are more sensitive to training. This thesis showed that parameters such as capillaries per fiber ratio and Na+,K+-ATPase expression may be good candidates to test. We recommend taking biopsies from at least two muscles, because adaptations in muscles are not necessarily the same in different parts of the body. In contrast to training, measuring MyHC fiber type composition and fiber size is very useful to support the diagnosis of a neuromuscular disease like LMND. To indicate the importance of Na+,K+-ATPase, it has been estimated that roughly 23% of all cytoplasmic ATP is hydrolyzed by sodium pumps in a resting human body. All Na+,K+-ATPase isoforms present in muscles of other mammalian species are also detected in equine muscle. The Na+,K+-ATPase isoforms at the mRNA level have been shown to be a good parameter to measure effects of acute exercise in both muscles of the horse, while measuring isoform protein expression is a solid parameter to confirm training adaptations. Finally, measurement of Na+,K+-ATPase isoform mRNAs in muscles of diseased horses was found to be a very sensitive method to detect changes in muscles of horses affected by LMND. Further investigation is required to determine whether the measurement Na+,K+-ATPase expression at both the mRNA and protein level could be a useful tool for diagnosing LMND in horses.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Atherosclerosis and arterial remodeling Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease and the primary cause of cardiovascular events like myocardial infarction. Based on plaque composition, stable and unstable atherosclerotic lesions are discriminated. Unstable lesions are prone to rupture and subsequent thrombus formation often results in acute occlusion of the artery. The size of the lumen of an atherosclerotic artery is determined by the atherosclerotic lesion, together with arterial remodeling. In early stages of atherosclerosis, outward arterial remodeling compensates for lumen loss due to plaque formation. However, in advanced atherosclerotic lesions, outward arterial remodeling is associated with rupture prone lesions. Inflammation and immune responses are involved in the initiation and progression of atherosclerotic disease. The immune system responds effectively to harmful agents by close interplay between the innate and adaptive immune systems. The innate immune response is the first line of defense against invading pathogens. Immune cells recognize pathogens via pattern recognition receptors, including scavenger receptors and Toll-like receptors. B- and T- cells are involved in the highly specific adaptive immune response. Toll-like receptors Toll-like receptors are not only expressed by immune cells, but also by vascular cells. In healthy arteries TLR4 is expressed in low levels. In atherosclerotic lesions, however, TLR4 expression is markedly increased. TLR4 is involved in intima formation and vulnerability for the development of carotid atherosclerosis. Whether TLR4 is also involved in arterial remodeling, the other determinant of lumen loss is investigated in this thesis. The Toll-like receptor 4 signaling in arterial remodeling We demonstrated that TLR4 is involved in outward arterial remodeling both with and without intima formation. TLR4 expression is upregulated during outward remodeling. TLR activation results in translocation of NF-?B into the nucleus and transcription of inflammatory genes. Downstream of TLR4, we investigated the role of NF-?B p50 in arterial remodeling. The p50 subunit is known as a regulatory subunit of NF-?B signaling. In our study, targeted deletion of the regulatory NF-?B p50 subunit enhanced flow-induced outward arterial remodeling. During outward arterial remodeling, levels of endogenous TLR4 ligands EDA and HSP60 are increased. Extra Domain A is incorporated in fibronectin during embryogenesis, wound healing, cellular damage and atherogenesis. We demonstrated a role of EDA in the process of outward remodeling, probably due to the diminished migration capacity of cells without EDA. Endogenous Toll-like receptor 4 ligand EDA in atherosclerosis Higher EDA levels are detected stable human atherosclerotic plaques. This observation implies that the detection of an endogenous TLR4 ligand not necessarily represent an inflammatory environment destabilizing the vulnerable plaque, but also may trigger the stabilization of atherosclerotic lesions. Interaction between Toll-like receptor 4 and Transforming Growth Factor ? signaling We found an association of endogenous TLR4 ligand EDA with Endoglin, an accessory receptor of TGF? in atherosclerotic lesions. This suggests communication between TLR4 and TGF pathways in atherosclerotic lesions. In monocytes, several sets of mRNAs are regulated by both TLR4 and TGF? stimulation and these mRNAs may play an important role in the progression of atherosclerotic disease leading to clinical events.'],\n",

       "  'Description': [\"When the public-law Sickness Benefits Act (Dutch Ziektewet) was privatised, this created the question of how to protect sick employees’ privacy in their labour-law relationship. It is now the employers' responsibility to carry out the labour-law scheme governing sickness, which is part of Title 7:10 of the Dutch Civil Code (Dutch Burgerlijk Wetboek). These new rules have caused tension in labour-law relations, since the instructions and measures issued by the employer may affect employees’ personal lives, thus restricting their fundamental right to privacy which follows from the Dutch Constitution and human rights treaties. Regulations should offer sick employees sufficient protection against the employer and any other parties who might violate their rights while executing the rules. Effective instruments should be available to act against violations. This thesis focuses on the question to what extent the privacy of sick employees is sufficiently protected by existing regulations. In order to answer this question, this thesis develops a normative assessment method. This method is necessary to answer the question of when the protection of privacy is ‘sufficient’. This method is based on the regulations and case law concerning the right to privacy. The result of the thesis is that on a large number of points, the execution of the legal scheme governing sickness meets the criteria concerning privacy protection. Violations are only committed on the basis of the legal powers granted by law to the employer and experts. The legislator has laid down additional rules regarding the provision of information as part of reintegration processes. Moreover, guarantees are in place to ensure confidential treatment of medical information. The relevant rules are based on the assumption that employers must not receive any medical information. Medical information is processed only by medical experts who are bound by medical professional secrecy. The medical profession has itself set very clear rules outlining which information can be provided to which party in the execution of the regulations governing sickness, this in order to guarantee medical secrecy. However, the analysis has also shown that on several other points the execution of the rules fails to meet the normative criteria, and where there is thus no sufficient protection of privacy. The answer to the research question is that in several respects legislation fails to meet some of the important criteria of privacy. The possible solutions consist of additions to or clarifications of several aspects of the law and regulations. The concluding chapter describes which legal provisions should be expanded or clarified and how. It would also be necessary to tighten the rules of the medical profession on some points, something which will be up to the professional medical organisations. In addition, the courts have an important role in offering the employee legal protection. This thesis makes also several recommendations regarding how courts can protect privacy.\"],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Carbohydrate chains play key roles in living organisms. Novel techniques have been developed in recent years to investigate the structure/function of carbohydrates. 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation in conjunction with NMR refinement, as well as surface plasmon resonance (SPR), have been employed in this thesis to map structures and biological functions of glycans. Chapter 1 gives an overview of the concept of prebiotics, probiotics and synbiotics, with particular emphasis on carbohydrates as possible prebiotics. Significant results obtained in recent clinical studies are also reported. In Chapter 2 the studies carried out in the framework of the European Union project “Novel Food Additives and bio-active components from milk for innovative engineering (NOFA)” are reported. To overcome the major bottleneck of obtaining naturally occurring oligosaccharides in sufficient amounts to perform structural characterization and biological testing, an improved protocol to isolate large quantities of lactose-free oligosaccharide fractions from non-human milk was developed. We demonstrated that naturally occurring galacto-oligosaccharides could be isolated in large amounts from skimmed goat milk (or colostrum) oligosaccharide pools, when incorporating a beta-galactosidase (E. coli) digestion in the protocol. Major components from goat colostrum were isolated and structurally characterized by high-pH anion-exchange chromatography, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, and NMR spectroscopy. Bacterial adhesion studies with isolated acidic oligosaccharide fractions showed a significant inhibition of the adherence of faecal Salmonella fyris B8132 to cultured intestinal epithelial cells. In Chapter 3 the isolation of tri- and tetrasaccharides from goat milk after enzymatic lactose hydrolysis with E. coli beta-galactosidase, and their structural analysis by methylation analysis, mass spectrometry, and NMR spectroscopy, is described. In Chapter 4, in an attempt to understand the biological significance of a recently discovered form of glycosylation, i.e. C-mannosylation, the conformation of Man1alpha-Trp in human RNase 2 was investigated. NMR experiments and molecular modeling calculations for (C2-alpha-D-Man-)Trp demonstrated that the C-linked mannopyranosyl residue exists in an ensemble of conformations, among which 1C4 is the most represented. For isolated glycopeptides, NMR showed no evidence for long-range connectivities and secondary structure, arguing against a stabilization of the analyzed glycopeptides, due to the C-linked mannopyranosyl residue. For native RNase 2, molecular modeling studies and NMR data revealed that the mannopyranosyl residue interacts with the loop residues Asp115-123 of RNase 2, the end of the beta strands Met105-Arg114 and the beginning of the beta strands Pro124-Ile134. These interactions stabilize not only to the mannose residue and Trp7 in a specific orientation, but also the N-terminal loop of the protein. Chapter 5 focuses on the feasibility of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to detect oligosaccharide-protein interactions. A serious constraint imposed by this technique concerns the dimension of the molecules to be employed as analytes. We developed an organoplatinum(II) label to increase the SPR response of low-molecular-mass analytes. Hence, we demonstrated to be able to detect binding events between monosaccharides and lectins even at very low analyte concentrations. The organoplatinum(II) complex did not influence the interaction, and platinum(II) was shown to be essential for the SPR signal enhancement.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Mammalian embryonic stem (ES) cells originate from preimplantation embryos and can be propagated indefinitely without loss of pluripotency; i.e. the potential to develop into any embryonic cell type. ES cells have been described for mouse, rhesus monkey, and human. There is considerable interest in human ES cells because of their potential role in future medicine to regenerate damaged tissues. Potential risks need to be investigated in adequate model species, before such therapies can be practiced in human. The pig is a good candidate model organism in terms of organ sizes, physiology, and physiological life-span. However, true ES-cell lines have not yet been described for livestock species. It has been hypothesized that the resistance of livestock species to ES-cell derivation is caused by the difference in embryonic development between species. An important finding that is described in the thesis is that key transciption factors that are important for pluripotency in the mouse, are differentially expressed in early pig, cow, and, mouse embryo development. This could have consequences for the mechanisms of generation of ES-cells in livestock species. Spermatogonial stem cells (SSC) can be another source of pluripotent cells, if cultured under the appropriate conditions. The aim of one study of the thesis was to isolate, culture, and characterize male porcine germ cells. In particular, the effect of four commonly used growth factors on the self-renewal of porcine SSCs was investigated. In primary cultures of male germ cells, a large effect was found of growth factor FGF, which had a negative influence on the expression of germ cell specific genes and a positive influence on the expression of genes specific for somatic cells. Little is known about the mechanism behind the transition of SSC to ES-like cells, but the tumor suppressors TRP53 and PTEN seem to be involved in inhibiting this process. To get more insight in the role of these tumor suppressors in SSC, their expression levels were independently knocked down through RNA interference in a murine SSC line. In either case, this resulted in upregulation of the pluripotency factor Nanog. Therefore, it is hypothesized that male germ cells are insulated from pluripotency through independent suppression of Nanog through TRP53 and PTEN. In mouse development, expression of the pluripotency factor NANOG is restricted to cells of the pluripotent epiblast and to primordial germ cells, which are both cell types that can give rise to pluripotent cells. Although recent reports demonstrate that the testis can also give rise to pluripotent cells and testis function is closely associated with pluripotency, expression of NANOG in the testis has not been described yet. In a comparative study, NANOG expression was detected in differentiating male germ cells of mouse, dog, pig, and human. The findings of this study indicate at a conserved role for NANOG in the meiotic and post-meiotic phase of spermatogenesis. It is hypothesized that NANOG is involved in the epigenetic events that occur before and after meiosis.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Clinical proteomics in breast cancer'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Breast cancer imposes a significant healthcare burden on women worldwide. Early detection is of paramount importance in reducing mortality, yet the diagnosis of breast cancer is hampered by a lack of adequate detection methods. In addition, better breast cancer prognostication may improve selection of patients eligible for adjuvant therapy. Hence, new markers for diagnosis and prognosis are warranted to improve breast cancer care. As proteins can provide the link between gene sequence and cellular physiology, and are readily accessible in biological matrices such as blood, they hold promise as potential biomarkers for cancer. Recent advances in mass spectrometry have enabled fast and simple analysis of the protein content of (clinical) samples. We applied surface-enhanced laser desorption ionisation-time of flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS) for the detection of potential biomarkers for breast cancer (BC). In a retrospective study, serum protein patterns comprising, among others, C3a des-Arginine anaphylatoxin, were found that could discriminate patients with breast cancer from healthy persons. However, since sensitivity and specificity were 60-75%, these profiles are presently not suitable for use in general diagnostic screening. To investigate the validity and robustness of reported serum protein profiles for BC, an independent patient population of BC and controls was analysed in our laboratory. None of the (partly) recovered markers was validated, exemplifying analytical (e.g., reproducibility) and statistical (e.g., data overfitting) problems. Furthermore, we found that pre-analytical variables such as storage duration can severely alter serum protein profiles, rendering strict sample handling protocols and assessment of potential confounding by pre-analytical variables of pivotal importance in proteomic investigations. In a retrospective follow-up study, we found the serum haptoglobin phenotype to be a strong and independent predictor of recurrence free survival. These results were, however, not confirmed following validation, emphasising the importance of validation in precluding chance results and erroneous conclusions. A subset of the validation set was subsequently fractionated, to facilitate detection of the low abundant serum proteome. A pattern of three proteins (one of which was identified as an inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain 4 fragment) was found to contain significant prognostic value. For clinical application, the validity of these candidate markers needs to be assessed by (quantitative) analyses of independent study populations. In prospectively collected breast tissue, we detected several proteins (two of which were identified as albumin fragments) which were gradually changing in abundance between control, benign breast disease and BC, or between the different stages of BC. Provided their validation, these proteins can provide insight into the pathophysiological mechanisms associated with, or underlying breast cancer development and aid in diagnosis. In conclusion, overseeing the results of SELDI-TOF MS breast cancer studies up to now, this platform holds promise as a screening tool for biomarker discovery. Yet, its successful application requires further consideration of key issues, e.g., sample handling procedures, enhancement of the dynamic range, reproducibility, and external validation of results. Provided that these studies are performed with adequate statistical power and analytical rigour, they could eventually fulfil the great promise that protein biomarkers have for improving breast cancer care.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Quality of diabetes care in general practice'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['In the Netherlands, a quality incentive is expected to ensue from improved collaboration between healthcare professionals. Whether this view is supported by sufficient evidence is, however, questionable. Therefore, the first study included in this thesis is a systematic review of studies on the effects of sharing and delegating diabetes care tasks. It became apparent that sharing and delegating care tasks can improve the process of care and glycaemic control. Sharing or delegating care, however, does hardly reduce patients’ other cardiovascular risk factors. High quality diabetes care requires the systematic delivery of care and the objective measurement of performance against predetermined standards. Consequently, there is a need for an objective method to assess the quality of diabetes management in different care settings In the third chapter of this thesis, a quality of care summary score (range 0 to 40 points) has been used to evaluate the quality of diabetes care. After taking case-mix differences and clustering at practice level into account, it has become apparent that the overall quality of diabetes care in primary and secondary care is equal. However, as the mean summary scores were approximately 20 points, there is still room for improvement. Although clinical practice guidelines are considered effective tools to improve the quality of diabetes care, their implementation may be troublesome. It has been suggested that end-user involvement in the development and adaptation of national guidelines may increase uptake. A randomised controlled trial, however, did not find any additional effect from local adaptation. Hence, it remains questionable whether local adaptation will enhance guideline implementation. In the fourth chapter we present the results of an RCT on the effects of the implementation of a locally adapted guideline on the care for patients with type 2 diabetes. In the intervention group, nurse facilitators enhanced guideline implementation by analysing barriers to change, introducing structured care, training practice staff and giving performance feedback. In the control group, GPs were asked to continue the care for people with diabetes as usually. The results of this study clearly demonstrate that multifaceted implementation of a locally adapted shared care guidelines can improve the process of diabetes care but in the short term hardly changes the cardiovascular risks of people with type 2 diabetes. Clinical inertia and non adherence to treatment regimens are considered major barriers to better diabetes care. In the chapters five and six, we present the results of our studies on the effects of clinical inertia and patients’ adherence on the outcomes of diabetes care. We used the baseline and follow-up data of the RCT mentioned previously. From these studies it has become apparent that especially clinical inertia is widespread. Both inertia and non-adherence to treatment regimens are related to the outcomes of diabetes care and represent important targets for quality improvement initiatives. When exploring the quality of diabetes care it is useful to distinguish structure, process and outcome measures. More and more patients’ opinions and access to care have also been recognized to be important indicators of the quality of care. In light of the advantages and disadvantages of each of these measures, it is advisable to include in any system of quality assessment, a combination of different indicators. As there is growing evidence of a link between treatment intensification, patients’ adherence to their treatment regimens and the outcomes of care, measures of clinical inertia and non-adherence should also be incorporated in future assessment systems. Based on these observations, a 16-item measure set has been proposed.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Histomonosis (blackhead) is a disease of galliform birds caused by the flagellated protozoan Histomonas meleagridis. Its primary target organs are the ceca and the liver. Especially in turkeys, mortality can be very high (up to 100%). In the 1960’s and 1970’s several effective antihistomonal compounds like nitarsone and dimetridazole were developed and the disease was brought under control. After these antihistomonals were banned from use in production animals due to possible toxic and carcinogenic properties, the disease re-emerged. The aim of the studies in this thesis was to optimize and develop methods for the detection and typing of H. meleagridis and to examine new possibilities to control the disease. Histomonas culture was optimized by adding more (100 mg instead of 12 mg) rice powder to the culture medium (Dwyer medium). This resulted in a 10-fold higher yield of parasites and the possibility to prolong cultures by addition of rice powder. Also it was found that a complex constituent, chicken embryo extract, was redundant. Another constituent, horse serum, proved essential. Several new possible antihistomonal products were examined by using in vitro (based on the imrpoved culture) and, if effective, in vivo models. Aromabioic™ and tiamulin were not effective in vitro and were not examined further. Enteroguard™ and Protophyt™ had no antihistomonal effect in vivo. Paromomycin, however, protected turkeys against an otherwise lethal challenge with H. meleagridis (full protection at 400 ppm, and partly protection at 200 ppm). A blocking ELISA was developed for the detection of antibodies in chicken and turkeys. The monoclonal antibody needed for this assay was raised against proteins extracted from H. meleagridis using a detergent (Triton X-114). While both chicken and turkeys seroconverted after a challenge with H. meleagridis, the ELISA showed no crossreactivity with Tetratrichomonas gallinarum. The ELISA is e.g. useful for seroepidemiological studies towards the distribution of H. meleagridis in chickens, which are considered a reservoir for the parasite. Finally, a novel subtyping technique (C-profiling) was developed. It is based on molecular techniques (PCR and sequening). The internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) region of the rRNA gene proved sufficiently variable for subtyping. Three subtypes of H. meleagridis was found. Type III possibly is Parahistomonas meleagridis, a nonpathogenic protozoan described some decades ago. Subtyping is useful if different genotypes are associated with different pathotypes. C-profiling was applied to a closely related pathogen of humans: Dientamoeba fragilis and was found to be a promising molecular epidemiological tool for studying the transmission, geographical distribution and relationships between strains and pathogenicity of this parasite.'],\n",

       "  'Description': [\"Following immune depletion, it is vital that the immune system recovers rapidly to avoid severe or life-threatening infections. In adults, full recovery of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell counts, important cell types of the immune system, may take years. Similar to other lymphocytes, T cells start their development in the bone marrow, but accomplish full maturation in the thymus. When mature T cells exit the thymus, they are antigen-inexperienced and are called 'naive'. Beside thymic naive T-cell generation, proliferation of naive T cells in the periphery is a source of naive T-cell production. The role of both mechanisms in the build-up of the naive T-cell compartment during childhood is not completely understood. In addition, the contribution of both mechanisms to naive T-cell recovery following immune deficiency is unclear. In this thesis, the establishment of the naive T-cell compartment during childhood was thoroughly assessed. Furthermore, the role of the thymus and peripheral proliferation during recovery of the T-cell compartment was determined: 1) in children who were treated with chemotherapy, 2) in children and adults who were treated with antiretroviral therapy for chronic HIV-1 infection, and 3) in children of whom the thymus had been completely removed in the first weeks of life. It was found that the thymus and peripheral proliferation both account for the establishment of the naive T-cell compartment during childhood. However, production of naive T cells by the thymus was crucial since only recently produced naive T cells by the thymus divide in the periphery. Thymic production was also important for the speed of naive T-cell recovery in children after cessation of chemotherapy. Peripheral proliferation may have contributed to naive T-cell recovery, but was not found elevated. This finding excludes the possibility that naive T-cell recovery is homeostatically regulated. Similar findings were observed in children for T-cell recovery during antiretroviral treatment for HIV-1 infection. Adults were also able to recover T-cell counts, but this took substantially longer (at least seven years of successful treatment) than in children (within one year). Beside these studies on T-cell dynamics in health and disease, a new method was created to identify naive T cells which have recently left the thymus, since these cells still bear thymic developmental features. By applying this method, the difficulty was resolved of discriminating between naive T cells that have recently been produced by the thymus and those that have circulated for years in the periphery. Collectively, the data presented in this thesis shed a new light on the mechanism of naive T-cell generation in health and disease. Therefore, in concert with the new method that was developed to identify recently produced naive T cells, physicians now have the opportunity to devise strategies that ameliorate naive T-cell recovery following immune depletion.\"],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Human and dogs share several similarities in their prostate disorders. The dog has therefore been proposed as a suitable animal model for the study of human prostate diseases. The aim of this thesis was to evaluate the dog as a suitable animal model for human prostate cancer (hPC) by obtaining basic information of spontaneous canine prostate cancers (cPC), validating the cellular origin of canine prostate cancer and comparing the results with the current knowledge of human prostate cancer development. In humans, the transiently proliferating/amplifying (TP/A) type cells of the prostatic acini have been postulated as the cellular origin of PC. In dogs however, the prostatic ductal cells have been hypothesized as the cellular origin of PC. To clarify this issue, we first investigated and described the canine hierarchical system of cell differentiation of the normal prostate epithelium. We then classified the different growth patterns of cPC and characterized the differentiation status of the cPC cells with various differentiation markers by immunohistochemistry. The histopathological classification shows that canine prostate cancer appears to be more aggressive and of a less differentiated type than most common hPC. From the immunohistochemical results we concluded that cPC most likely originates from the basal cells of the collecting ducts. In humans, DNA sequence mutations, expression and regulation changes of the androgen receptor (AR) are among the causes of androgen unresponsiveness. In addition, men with a decreased size of a CAG repeat within the AR gene are more prone to developing PC than others. We therefore investigated the contribution of the androgen receptor to the development of cPC by evaluating AR expression and AR sequence analysis in cPC specimens. We also investigated the influence of a similar canine AR CAG repeat on the incidence of cPC. A predominant cytoplasmic AR staining was found in prostate cancer of both castrated and intact dogs. The cytoplasmic localization was not related to mutations in the DNA binding domain of the AR, which suggests that mechanisms that lead to an impaired androgen –AR signaling or a basal/stem cell like origin may explain the low cytoplasmic AR staining in cPC. Moreover, our study about the CAG repeats of AR gene suggest that short CAG-1 repeats are associated with an increased risk of developing PC in the dog. Many studies report the importance of chronic inflammation as the cause of PC initiation and progression and the expression of the inflammatory mediator COX-2 has been documented in both human and canine prostate cancer. We evaluated whether COX-2 expression in cPC is related to the tumor histology and to the presence of inflammation. Although COX-2 expression was demonstrated in cPC, a potential role for inflammation in the carcinogenesis of cPC could not be proven due to an inverse correlation between inflammation and COX-2 expression. Our results indicate that spontaneous cPC resembles human late stage PC in several, histological and molecular, aspects. Hence, further research using spontaneous canine prostate as a model for its human counterpart may generate beneficial results for both humans and dogs.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Epilepsy is a neurological disorder that leads to seizures affecting a variety of mental and physical functions. Antiepileptic drugs are the mainstay of treatment. However, in one third of patients treatment fails: patients keep getting seizures or experience bothersome side effects. In this thesis the two components of treatment failure in epilepsy are studied: 1. Ineffectiveness: the burden that seizures cannot be controlled with medication and 2. Adverse effects: the unwanted symptoms of antiepileptic drugs. We state that treatment response -independent of the disease or the syndrome- relies on three key actors: the patient, the drug, and the health care professional. In this thesis, the interaction and the different roles of these important modulators on treatment response in epilepsy was clarified. In the first part we illustrated that health care professional-related factors such as changes in medication regimes, and patient-related factors such as omitting medication can lead to insufficient seizure control. Also, we concluded that patients with low antiepileptic drugs serum levels have a nine times higher risk of seizures compared with patients with therapeutic antiepileptic drugs levels. Therapeutic drug monitoring is therefore a valuable tool that, once used appropriate, may prevent seizures. In the second part of this thesis gene-related causes of drug-resistant epilepsy were studied. This is an interesting phenomenon since if an association between certain genetic factors and refractory epilepsy could be confirmed, patients with epilepsy could be screened beforehand in order to optimize drug selection leading to improved seizure-control. To study pharmacogenetic associations almost 300 patients treated at one of the main tertiary epilepsy centres in the Netherlands were asked to participate. We extensively explored the association between all known variations (high resolution haplotypes) of the ABCB1 gene and drug-resistant epilepsy as well as a functional polymorphism in the SCN1A gene and drug-resistant epilepsy. No association was found for individual polymorphisms or haplotypes from ABCB1 or SCN1A and drug-resistant epilepsy. In the third part adverse effects of antiepileptic drugs are studied. For this thesis we made a selection of those that we thought were clinically relevant and often leading to therapeutic failure. Hypersensitivity reactions can be severe in patients using antiepileptic drugs; so far it was unclear why this occurs. We found that the presence of an aromatic ring as a commonality in chemical structures of antiepileptic drugs may explain hypersensitivity reactions. Aplastic anemia is a rare, but feared adverse effect of drug treatment often responsible for taking drugs from the market. We studied whether the use of antiepileptic drugs was associated with aplastic anemia. Our conclusion was that use of antiepileptic drugs is associated with a ninefold increased risk of aplastic anemia. Therefore, health care professionals should be alert to the possibility of AED-associated aplastic anemia. In conclusion, treatment failure in epilepsy has an enormous impact on daily life. In this thesis we studied causes of ineffectiveness and adverse events of AED treatment and provided suggestions for interventions in order to improve treatment response in patients with epilepsy.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The heart is a muscular organ that pumps blood throughout the body. The human heart contracts approximately once per second, adding up to more than 2.5 billion contractions over 80 years. Failure in cardiac contraction leads to sudden cardiac death, which is one of the most common causes of death in the industrialized world. In most cases this is caused by ventricular fibrillation (VF). During VF turbulent excitation patterns occur, causing uncoordinated contraction of the ventricles. If VF is not halted by means of defibrillation, blood circulation will cease, causing cardiac death within minutes. One important tool to study the mechanisms underlying cardiac physiology, is mathematical modeling. Over the last decades mathematical models ranging from single cell dynamics to complex three-dimensional whole organ models have been used to study cardiac arrhythmias. The focus of this thesis is to gain more insight in the underlying mechanisms of VF using electrophysiological and mechanical models of the human heart. We are especially interested in mechano-electrical feedback and in the role of tissue heterogeneity in the onset of cardiac arrhythmias. In the first part of this thesis we investigated the basic effects of mechano-electrical feedback in two-dimensional systems using simple low dimensional models to describe cardiac excitable behavior. In the second part of this thesis we used anatomically based models of the human ventricles to study the mechanisms and dynamics of VF and investigated the effects of tissue heterogeneity and mechano-electrical feedback. The most important conclusions regarding mechano-electrical feedback is that local tissue deformations can lead to automatic pacemaker activity via the stretch-activated channels, and that local stretch of fibers can cause an otherwise stable spiral wave to break up. The most important conclusions regarding tissue heterogeneity is that action potential duration restitution heterogeneity is not only important for the initiation of wavebreaks and re-entry, but also affects the dynamics of ventricular fibrillation. Furthermore, different initial conditions can lead to different mechanisms of ventricular fibrillation: either mother rotor or multiple wavelet ventricular fibrillation. These results indicate that mechano-electrical feedback and tissue heterogeneity may play an important role in the initiation and dynamics of ventricular fibrillation. Hence, reducing electrophysiological heterogeneity may be a fruitful target for therapeutic intervention.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Peroxisome proliferators-activated receptors (PPARs) are members of the nuclear receptor family of ligand activated transcription factors and consist of the three isoforms, PPAR\\uf061, PPAR\\uf062/\\uf064 and PPAR\\uf067. Considerable evidence has established the importance of PPARs in myocardial lipid homeostasis and cardiovascular function. Yet, the PPAR isoform specific gene expression profile in the heart has not been fully delineated. By combining gene profiling and computational PPRE analysis following PPAR isoform activation in normal versus PPAR deficient heart muscle cells we have, for the first time, determined the PPAR isoform-specific endogenous targets in the heart. Unexpectedly, electromobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated the existence of an evolutionary conserved PPRE consensus-binding site in an igf1 enhancer. In line, Wy-14643 mediated PPAR\\uf061 activation in the wild-type mouse heart resulted in upregulation of igf1 transcript abundance and provided protection against cardiomyocyte apoptosis following ischemia/reperfusion or biomechanical stress. In response to acute pressure overload stimulation induced by aortic banding, the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK) MEK1 has been shown to be activated. In chapter 3, we show that activation of the MEK1-ERK1/2 pathway leads to specific inhibition of PPARα transcriptional activity. Furthermore we show, for the first time, that this inhibitory effect is mediated by MEK1, and not by its downstream effector kinase ERK1/2, through a mechanism involving direct binding to PPARα and subsequent stimulation of PPARα export out of the nucleus. Although PPAR\\uf062\\uf02f\\uf064 is an abundant member of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) family, limited information is available on the function of PPAR\\uf062\\uf02f\\uf064 in the adult myocardium. To circumvent the embryonic lethality associated with postnatal deletion of PPAR\\uf062/\\uf064, we triggered conditional PPAR\\uf062/\\uf064 loss through the use of a tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase in the postnatal murine myocardium. Targeted PPAR\\uf062/\\uf064 deletion in adult mice provoked premature death within one week accompanied by rapid and dramatic biventricular enlargement and dramatic atrial enlargement. Overall, these results indicate that PPAR\\uf062\\uf02f\\uf064 loss suffices to impact both adult myocardial morphology and function. The transcription factor myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) an important co-factor of PPARs and a downstream target for several hypertrophic signaling pathways in the heart. In chapter 5, we subjected wildtype and transgenic mice expressing a dominant negative form of MEF2 (DN-MEF2 Tg) in the heart to transverse aortic constriction (TAC). Echocardiographic analysis revealed that DN-MEF2 Tg mice displayed a decrease in cardiac function. Analysis of the mitochondrial respiratory chain showed that DN-MEF2 Tg mice displayed lower expression of NADH dehydrogenase subunit 6 (ND6), part of the large Complex I enzyme, only following pressure overload. The reduced expression of ND6 in DN-MEF2 Tg mice after pressure overload resulted in an increase in cell death secondary to overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Although PPAR share many aspects such as protein homology, we here provide an insight in isoform specific target genes and consequently new mechanisms of PPAR function in the heart. In addition, we show that transcriptional co-regulators of PPAR have an important role in the indirect regulation of PPAR function.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['This thesis is about International Medical Graduates or foreign doctors, trained outside the European Economic Area, who settle permanently in the Netherlands. From the early nineties the number of foreign doctors residing in the Netherlands either as refugees or as partners/spouses of Dutch citizens has risen steadily. Foreign doctors who wish to practise medicine in the Netherlands must obtain a declaration of professional competence, issued by the Department of Public Health, Welfare and Sports (VWS). A considerable number of foreign doctors received negative decisions by the Health Department. They were not allowed to practise medicine in the Netherlands. As a result, from the mid nineties, a growing number of foreign doctors applied to the medical faculties for admission as medical students in order to obtain a Dutch medical degree. Therefore, in 1995, it was decided to institute the Committee Influx Foreign Doctors (CIBA), a central placing committee. Between 1996 and 2007 the CIBA has processed over a 1000 admission requests. Until 2002, in spite of the imminent shortage of doctors, the Department of Health had done little to enhance the use of the expertise brought in by the foreign doctors for the benefit of Dutch society. The focus of this investigation has been: 1. How is it guaranteed that foreign doctors meet the medical quality standards (knowledge, skills, attitude), or how is the assessment of these qualities measured. And 2. After obtaining permanent residency in the Netherlands, do foreign doctors have access to the profession for which they had qualified before in their country of origin or another non-EEA country? Late 2001 the Department of Health and the medical schools were stimulated to cooperate in order to improve the additional training programmes for foreign doctors. It led to the new assessement procedure for foreign doctors that came into force in December 2005. This thesis contains two reports on the medical careers of foreign doctors. These investigations showed that nearly all foreign doctors had managed to find jobs as doctors in the Netherlands after their graduation. To the question which had hindered them most in their medical careers many reported that the Dutch language was their main obstacle. A comparative study into the policies towards medical doctors in ten EEA-countries shows that there are enormous differences between the European countries. The most important difference is that in Denmark, Norway and Sweden one medical school per country organises additional training programmes for non-EEA doctors on special request by their Departments of Health. Another large difference is the duration of the additional training programmes. The study reveals that the participating EEA-countries are largely unaware of the assessment procedures regarding non-EEA doctors in other countries. The study offers a preview of the preconditions of a successful implementation of the new assessment procedure. New pitfalls are the lack of preparatory courses (Dutch as a second language, Medical Dutch, English, computer skills), the high costs of the assessment procedure and the lack of any link between the procedure candidates with a university. As yet it is not clear whether in the future local social services will allow foreign doctors to study while receiving social benefits. An evaluation study into the effects of the assessment procedure is recommended.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The dog is one of the few species to develop spontaneous prostate carcinoma (PCA) and is thus an attractive model for the study of the disease in humans. Many of the features of the disease in the dog are similar to its human counterpart, however a number of aspects of the pathogenesis, diagnosis and management of the disease are different between dogs and people. The first aim of the thesis was to investigate aspects of the pathogenesis of PCA in dogs. This thesis presents some similarities and some differences between dogs and humans in the pathogenesis of PCA. The expression of COX-2 is not related to inflammation or to the degree of differentiation in canine PCA as it is in humans. However, similar to human PCA, androgen ablation is associated with increased inflammation in the neoplastic tissue. Like humans, dogs with PCA have a shorter CAG-I repeat in the AR gene, but variations in length are much smaller than in humans. Differences in CAG repeat length and plasma androgens that may explain ethnic differences in the prevalence of PCA in humans cannot explain the predisposition of the Bouvier des Flandres to develop PCA. There is growing evidence of a potential protective effect of androgens in the development of PCA in dogs. The second aim of this thesis was to develop therapeutic tools for the management of PCA in dogs. Treatment of canine PCA remains palliative as it is effective in relieving clinical signs but cannot offer a cure. This thesis introduces an effective surgical technique for short-term management of PCA in dogs, provided there is no urethral obstruction. Photodynamic therapy is a promising treatment modality for cancer in general and prostate carcinoma in particular, however technical improvements to allow more efficient and even administration of light to prostatic tissue are necessary to make it useful in the management of clinical cases. Additional research needs to be performed to develop new techniques to remove canine PCA without recurrence or detrimental side effects. Total prostatectomy techniques, while preserving continence in the dog, partial prostatectomy with effective adjunctive radio-, chemo- or immunotherapy, or local minimally invasive interventional techniques can be mentioned as examples.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Priming Arabidopsis for defense : Molecular and ecological aspects'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Plants are capable to enhance basal defense strategies against harmful organisms upon the perception of certain stimuli. This enhanced resistance is not necessarily accompanied by direct activation of defenses, but often depends on a sensitization of the plant tissue to express defenses faster and/or stronger when the plant is under attack. In analogy with a similar phenomenon in animals, this is commonly called priming. This thesis describes that priming induced in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana by exogenous application of the non-protein amino acid ?-aminobutyric acid (BABA) or root colonization by the non-pathogenic rhizobacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens WCS417r is accompanied by direct transcriptional activation of distinct sets of transciptionfactor (TF) genes. It is believed that these TFs will further remain inactive until subsequent pathogen attack, when they will enhance the expression of salicylic acid (SA)- and jasmonic acid (JA)-dependent defenses, respectively. BABA induced the expression of 22 out of the 72 known WRKY TF genes, mostly in a NPR1-dependent manner. This fits the SA-dependency of resistance induced by BABA (BABA-IR), since WRKYs are key transcriptional regulators of SA-dependent defenses. Promoter analysis identified an overrepresentation of a certain motif in the promoters of these BABA-inducible WRKY genes. This motif, TAG[TA]CT, may represent an important cis-acting element in BABA-induced priming of SA-dependent defenses. However, BABA also primes SA-independent cell wall defense, resulting in an enhanced deposition of callose containing papillae in response to fungal or oomycetal penetration. This priming for cell wall defense by BABA is dependent on intact absicic acid (ABA) and phosphoinositide signaling. In order to identify novel regulators involved in BABA-induced priming of callose depositions, an ethylmethance sulfonate (EMS)-mutagenesis screen was set up to identify mutants impaired in BABA-induced immunity (ibi). This resulted in the identification of ibi1, whose mutation maps to the lower arm of chromosome 4. IBI1 acts likely upstream of or parallel to ABA. Preliminary results points towards a possible role for IBI1 in the regulation of the redox state of the cell. Further characterization of ibi1 will lead to new insights in BABA-induced priming of cell wall defense. A cost-benefit analysis of priming indicated that priming is a cost-efficient method for plants to protect themselves in regions with high disease incidence, since priming induces only marginal trade-offs on growth and seed set under enemy free conditions. The existence of natural Arabidopsis accessions that have genetically acquired a primed capacity to express SA- and/or JA-dependent defenses fits the hypothesis that priming seems a beneficial strategy for plants in hostile environments. The question remains whether plants grown in nature have already acquired a primed defensive capacity. A preliminary field experiment indeed showed that wild-type plants may have acquired a primed defensive capacity under the specific environmental conditions of that field experiment, although more field-experiments should be conducted to study the extent and the conditions of priming in crop plants. A better understanding of the priming phenomenon may ultimately lead to the use of priming as a durable protection strategy in agriculture.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['In Western economies the number of independent professionals (a.k.a. freelancers) is on the rise. The independent professional is a relatively new phenomenon that does not fit the traditional industrial era distinction between entrepreneurs and employees. In some aspects these independent professionals resemble entrepreneurs as they constantly look for new clients and new products to bring to the market. In other aspects they are similar to employees. The thesis looks into the three main questions: 1) why the number of freelancers is growing, 2) what the drivers are of freelance career success, and 3) how the growth of freelancing impacts traditional organizations. The thesis argues that the growth of freelancing is irreversible attached to the growth in the knowledge sector and is caused by technology developments that have given more power to the individual and decreased transaction costs. The study defines freelance career success both in monetary terms as well as in satisfaction terms. It shows that monetary success is largely determined by market factors (e.g. supply and demand, monopoly power, et cetera), human capital, and social capital. Personality, business strategy and motivation are less important for monetary success. For career satisfaction, it is almost the other way round; personality, business strategy and social capital are at the heart of freelance career satisfaction. Human capital, market factors and motivation are not so important for freelance career satisfaction. Finally the thesis shows that freelance growth can be an asset for existing organizations when these organizations are actively using the extra creativity and flexibility that freelancers bring. But the growth in freelance markets also poses a threat to knowledge organizations. Knowledge organizations have to adapt their strategy to make sure that they bring something to their clients that freelance markets have difficulty to offer (e.g. quality guarantees).'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Cytomegalovirus (CMV) are wide-spread herpesviruses, which establish life-long persistence in the host upon primary infection. Primary infection with herpesviruses causes usually only mild symptoms, however in some situations, such as during immunosuppression or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, serious disease can develop. It is thought that these diseases are the consequence of deregulation of herpesvirus-specific T-cell immunity. To understand deregulation of herpesvirus-specific T-cell responses, we studied the kinetics of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and CMV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses during primary infection in patients developing IM or during chronic infection in various clinical settings, including patients with HIV infection and stem cell transplant (SCT) recipients. EBV-specific T-cell immunity is studied in patients with infectious mononuclosis. This study shows that T-cell responses are mainly directed to lytic proteins short after primary infection, whereas half a year after primary infection, most T-cell responses are directed to latent proteins. Furthermore, EBV-specific T-cell responses are studied in HIV infected individuals during HIV infection and after initiation of HAART. Previous data showed differences in kinetics of T-cell responses to either a latent (EBNA1) or a lytic (BZLF1) protein during HIV infection and long-term HAART. We now investigated whether the kinetics are representative for dynamics of responses to latent and lytic proteins in general or whether these responses are protein specific. To this end we determined T-cell responses to another latent and lytic protein. Our results suggest that the kinetics of T-cell responses to each protein are unique, rather than that they display a general pattern of latent or lytic T-cell responses. To determine whether CMV-specific T-cell responses can be restored after treatment with HAART, we aimed to study the matrix protein pp65 and immediate early antigen (IE)1-specific T-cell responses during HIV infection and treatment with HAART. This study suggests that HIV-infection leads to an altered CMV biology, affecting pp65- and IE1-specific T-cell responses in a different way, which is not restored by treatment with long-term HAART. Future studies should aim to achieve better insight in to EBV and CMV gene expression during HIV infection and treatment with HAART. It would be interesting to study viral gene expression in parallel with antigen-specific T-cell responses. In SCT patients we studied CMV-specific T-cell responses as well as T-cell activation, T-cell activation and perforin expression. We show that in patients with CMV reactivation CMV-specific IFN? production and proliferation were observed more frequently compared to patients without CMV reactivation. Furthermore a skewed phenotype towards more differentiated effector T cells was observed in patients with CMV reactivation. Also perforin expression by CD8+ T cells, which is a more general feature of cytolytic effector T cells, was higher in patients with CMV reactivation. Together these data may counter intuitively suggest that CMV antigen is required for CMV-specific T-cell reconstitution after SCT. We hypothesize that IE1-specific T-cell responses may be important against protection against disease in HIV infected individuals and SCT recipients. Therefore it would be interesting to study IE1-specific T-cell responses in HIV patients and SCT patients progressing towards CMV dis ease.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Posttranslational regulation of copper transporters'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['The transition metal copper is an essential cofactor for many redox-active enzymes, but excessive copper can generate toxic reactive oxygen species. Copper homeostasis is maintained by highly conserved proteins, to balance copper uptake, distribution and export on the systemic and cellular level. The research in this thesis entitled “Posttranslational regulation of copper transporters” aims to unravel the mechanisms that regulate cellular copper uptake and export in relation to the molecular pathogenesis of Wilson disease (WD), a hereditary copper overload disorder. To allow quantitative, sensitive and high-throughput assessment of changes in cellular copper homeostasis, we developed the MRE-Luciferase reporter that was able to monitor bio-available copper in a copper-concentration-dependent manner. The human high-affinity copper transporter 1 (hCTR1) is essential for cellular copper uptake, but several observations have indicated the existence of hCTR1-independent copper uptake pathways. We characterized the homologous human CTR2 (hCTR2) as a bona fide copper uptake protein with low affinity for copper compared to hCTR1 using our MRE-Luciferase reporter. hCTR1 was localized at the plasma membrane and in intracellular organelles, whereas hCTR2 was exclusively localized in late endosomes and lysosomes. Hence, we speculate that hCTR2 enables mobilization of copper from lysosomal copper pools in analogy with its function in yeast. Electron microscopic crystallography of recombinant hCTR1 had revealed that hCTR1 subunits assemble in oligomeric complexes comprising three hCTR1 subunits. Here, we assessed the necessity of hCTR1 oligomerization in functional copper uptake. hCTR1-dependent copper uptake was completely abolished by conversion of two highly conserved methionine residues in the second transmembrane helix of hCTR1 into isoleucines (hCTR1 M150I-M154I). Co-expression of hCTR1 M150I-M154I with wild type (WT) hCTR1 did not affect oligomerization, expression or cellular localization of WT hCTR1, but WT hCTR1-dependent copper uptake was inhibited in a dominant fashion. Similar results were obtained for hCTR2, suggesting that oligomerization of hCTR1 and hCTR2 is required for copper transport activity by permitting the formation of a copper permeable channel. Hepatic copper excretion is mediated by ATP7B, and mutations in ATP7B result in WD. We investigated the possibility that defects arising from some WD mutations are ameliorated by drug treatment to improve protein folding and function. Homology modeling of distinct ATP7B missense mutations suggested that most mutations result in misfolded ATP7B proteins. Indeed, almost all tested mutations resulted in reduced ATP7B protein expression. Furthermore, physiological localization of ATP7B to the trans-Golgi network was abrogated, and mutant ATP7B was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum instead. The increased expression and normalization of localization after culturing cells at 30C suggested that these proteins were indeed misfolded. Four distinct mutations exhibited residual copper export capacity, which suggests that improved expression of these mutants could restore ATP7B expression in these patients. Interestingly, treatment with pharmacological chaperones curcumin and 4-phenylbutyrate, a clinically approved compound, partially restored expression and localization of most ATP7B mutants. The surprisingly large number of WD mutations that result in protein misfolding indicates that pharmacological chaperone-treatment to improve protein folding, localization and function might actually improve clinical management of a significant proportion of WD-patients in the future.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['The endometrial factor in human embryo implantation'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['The studies presented in this thesis aimed to explore the role of the endometrium in the implantation process. At present, embryo implantation is the major rate-limiting step for success in fertility treatment. Clinicians have sought to develop clinical interventions aimed at enhancing implantation rates from IVF. As reviewed in this thesis, there is no evidence supporting the empirical use of most pharmaceutical interventions, such as aspirin, nitric oxide, aromatase inhibitors, ascorbic acid, prolonged progesterone treatment, or insulin sensitizing drugs, in an unselected IVF population. A meta-analysis of RCTs on the effect of adjuvant glucocorticoids in the peri-implantation period was performed and showed higher pregnancy rates in women undergoing IVF (not ICSI) using adjuvant glucocorticoids of borderline significance. For ethical and practical reasons it is difficult to study human embryo implantation in vivo, since many approaches will risk disturbing the process itself. Endometrial secretion aspiration prior to embryo transfer and analysis by a multiplex immunoassay is non-invasive and has been shown to be safe and a clinically useful approach to study the endometrial factor in human embryo implantation. We have shown that endometrial secretion cytokine profiling identifies a profile conducive to clinical pregnancy, and the ability to predict clinical pregnancy by interleukin (IL)-1? and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-? levels in endometrial secretions was similar and additive to the predictive value of embryo quality. Supraphysiological sex steroid levels resulting from ovarian stimulation are considered to be detrimental to endometrial receptivity in IVF. Significantly higher concentrations of IL-1߬ IL-5, IL-10, IL-12, IL-17, TNF-?, Heparin-binding Epidermal Growth Factor (Hb-EGF), Eotaxin, and Dickkopf homolog (Dkk)-1 were present in endometrial secretions obtained in stimulated compared to natural cycles. There is evidence that embryo implantation rates may be impaired by the pathogenic effects of bacterial vaginosis. The intra-uterine cytokine profile of women with or without bacterial vaginosis was assessed and women with bacterial vaginosis showed cytokine concentrations which were within the normal range compared to controls, with a tendency to a more pro-inflammatory profile. Previous approaches to investigate implantation have generally relied on the analysis of individual candidate genes. To date no single marker has been identified that is specific and sensitive in identifying a receptive endometrium though. Microarray analysis enables an approach from a global genomic perspective. Results of the largest set of microarray data on the endometrial transcriptome in women with idiopathic recurrent implantation failure versus controls have been reported. Dysregulated pathways in the endometrium in women with recurrent implantation failure have been identified meriting further investigation. Concerning the endometrial factor in the human implantation process in the general IVF population, we believe that we can conclude from the studies presented in this thesis that the endometrium is an important determinant of success and is not simply facilitory. However, a diminished endometrial receptivity as the primary cause of recurrent implantation failure may only be present in a limited number of patients, who cannot be easily identified by known clinical parameters or an endometrial gene expression profile. A test for endometrial receptivity remains elusive.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The central aim of this thesis was to unravel the relationship between patient characteristics, communication between patient and clinician, and subsequent patient information recall in the context of medical consultations with older cancer patients. Chapter 2 reviewed the literature to explore age differences in cancer patients’ need for information and support surrounding cancer treatment. The results indicated that older patients prefer to receive information about the most important aspects of their illness and treatment, but are relatively less interested in all the details. Furthermore, older patients have less prominent needs for psychosocial support than younger patients. In Chapter 3, we assessed to what extent age influences communication between cancer patients and their oncologist and determined the influence of chronological age, other age-related factors and communication on patients’ recall. The results showed that recall decreased with age, but only when the total amount of information presented and the consultation length were taken into account. Recall was also influenced by prognosis in two ways. Firstly, patients with a poorer prognosis recalled proportionally less. Secondly, the more information that was provided about prognosis, the less information patients proportionally recalled, regardless of their actual prognosis. In Chapter 4 we developed a questionnaire to measure older cancer patients’ recall of information after a patient education session, conducted by nurses preceding chemotherapy. Since our study was the first to investigate recall of this type of consultation, no existing questionnaire was available that suited our aims. The results showed that older cancer patients were confronted with a large amount of detailed information and recommendations (on average 82 items) and had marked difficulties actively recalling the information (23% for open-ended questions), whereas recognition memory was relatively good (80% for multiple-choice questions). Sensitive responses to cancer patients’ emotions and needs for information (‘cues’) have been associated with improved outcomes such as reduced distress. We looked at these responses in relation to recall in Chapter 5. We found that the expression of neither emotional cues nor informational cues influenced recall. The way in which nurses responded to informational cues did not influence recall either. In contrast, recall was affected by responses to emotional cues. When nurses used minimal encouragements, such as ‘Hmmm’ or ‘Go on’, in response to an emotional cue, patients recalled more. Distancing responses, such as ignoring the cue, resulted in lower recall scores. Older cancer patients are more commonly accompanied to the consultation. These companions may enhance communication thereby increasing the patients’ recall. Furthermore, companions may remember different information. In Chapter 6 we investigated recall of information in unaccompanied and accompanied older cancer patients and their companions. The results revealed that pooled recall in patient and companion couples was higher than their separate recall scores, indicating that the older cancer patient and their companion supplement each other. Combined recall in the patient-companion dyad was also significantly higher than recall in unaccompanied patients for absolute scores but not for proportion of information recalled. Nurses discussed more information when companions were present and accompanied consultations were longer in duration.'],\n",

Over the last years, experimental studies have yielded important information about the effect of vaccination on disease symptoms and excretion. However, little is known about the effect of vaccination on transmission, which is crucial when an epidemic has to be controlled by vaccination. The main goal of this thesis was to gain insight in the transmission parameters of HPAI viruses in birds, and in the effect of vaccination on transmission. To this end, transmission experiments with different HPAI strains in unvaccinated and vaccinated birds of different species were performed. To better understand the origin of an HPAI outbreak from an LPAI outbreak, the transmission characteristics of genetically closely related HPAI and LPAI strains (A/Chicken/Pennsylvania/83) from the subtype H5N2 were compared (Chapter 2). The LPAI and HPAI strains appear to differ quite substantially in their key epidemiological parameters, with the HPAI strain spreading more efficiently and having a longer infectious period. In Chapters 3 and 4 the effect of vaccination on transmission of an H7N7 virus that caused a major epidemic in the Netherlands in 2003 was studied. It appears that the effect of vaccination on transmission depends on the bird species, the vaccine, and timing of vaccination relative to the moment of challenge. A single vaccination was able to sufficiently reduce transmission in chickens (Chapter 3), and in teals (Chapter 4), while in pheasants no significant reduction in transmission was observed (Chapter 4). In chickens a difference in the effect of vaccination on transmission was observed between two vaccines that differed in homology and HA content, and between the time points after vaccination (Chapter 3). Chapter 5 elaborates on this theme by focusing on the transmission dynamics of HPAI H5N1 virus in Pekin ducks. The results show that a genetically distant vaccine is able to significantly reduce transmission, although the analyses did not allow us to conclude that transmission is reduced to the extent that no major outbreaks can occur. The results of Chapters 3-5, furthermore, have shown that silent transmission can occur in vaccinated birds. This implies that vaccination programs should be accompanied by monitoring based on a DIVA (Differentiating Infected from Vaccinated Animals) strategy. Therefore, in Chapter 6 three different DIVA tests were validated using sera that were obtained from the experiments in Chapter 3. The analyses show that two serological tests based on a heterologous neuraminidase have sensitivities and specificities of more than 0.90 in detecting antibodies, while the sensitivity in detecting infection is substantially lower. The discrepancy between the sensitivity in detecting antibodies and in detecting infection can be explained by the finding that chickens with no virus excretion or only a short period of virus excretion after infection only have a low probability to develop antibodies.'],\n",

       "  'Description': [\"The demand for efficient systems that facilitate searching in multimedia databases and collections is vastly increasing. Application domains include criminology, musicology, trademark registration, medicine and image or video retrieval on the web. This thesis discusses content-based retrieval techniques that can be applied on these databases. The most important operation to support is query-by-example: retrieve items that are to some extent similar to a given query. In chapter 2 we study vantage indexing, a generic indexing approach not limited to a specific domain, because it only requires a (preferably metric) way of calculating a distance between the objects. With vantage indexing, objects are no longer compared directly, but it is investigated how similar their resemblance is to a set of reference objects: the vantage objects. We present a new way of selecting vantage objects, and demonstrate experimentally the scalability of the approach and the improvement in retrieval performance over existing methods. In many applications, it is possible to represent the objects by graphs. In chapter 3 we propose an indexing strategy for these scenarios. The assumption is that the graph's topology can be used to describe the underlying object. This topology is stored the laplacian matrix, and the sorted set of eigenvalues (spectrum) of this matrix is used as an indexing signature. To account for partial similarity, the difference in spectra of many subgraphs is considered as well. Both theory and experimental work support the claim that similarity in laplacian spectrum predicts similarity between the original objects. The proposed representation outperforms existing methods in various application domains. A possible limitation of the approach presented in chapter 3 is that two graphs with the same topology share the same representation, while the underlying objects may be different. In chapter 4, we enrich the graph representation therefore by storing additional object properties. We develop a complex-valued analogue of the laplacian matrix, a Hermitian matrix, and use its eigenvector associated to the second smallest eigenvalue as indexing signature. This eigenvector is known to be informative about the graph, and can be reused to partition the graph into meaningful subgraphs, resulting in less subgraphs to compare for partial similarity. We provide a successful instance of this framework within the context of 3D object retrieval. In chapter 5, we claim that good retrieval results are not only relevant to the query, they should in fact reflect the diversity of the relevant objects that are present in the collection as well. Given an initial result set for a user query (image search), we propose to cluster the retrieved images based on their visual characteristics and to show the most important objects from each cluster. We first dynamically determine appropriate weights of visual features for a specific query. These weights are used in a dynamic ranking function that is deployed in a clustering technique to obtain a diverse ranking based on cluster representatives. We provide three lightweight and efficient clustering algorithms, and show that the algorithmic output coincides consistently with the results of a user study .\"],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the most common infectious disease requiring hospitalisation in the Western world. In spite of improving antibiotic regiments, CAP still has significant mortality. In non-immune compromised patients, Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most frequently isolated micro-organism in CAP, followed by the Gram-negative bacterium Haemophilus influenzae There are many known risk factors for CAP caused by a specific pathogen. Nevertheless, many patients, especially young patients, do not contain any of these risk factors for CAP. A possible explanation could be that these patients are at risk for CAP caused by a specific micro-organism due to genetic variations within their immune system. The outline of this thesis is to identify such variations within a part of the immune system: innate immunity. As expected, we found Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae to be the most frequently identified micro-organisms in CAP. Patient characteristics (medical history of hypertension), clinical characteristics (low C-reactive protein) and a history of prior antibiotic use, contribute to the failure of identifying the pathogens and the causative micro-organisms in CAP. In this thesis a three-step diagnostic protocol is presented, in which by the time the first two steps are completed all clinical relevant micro-organisms are identified within 48h after patient admission through sputum and blood cultures, urine antigen test and PCR of the sputum for Chlamydophila species, Legionella pneumophila and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. The role of the ACE I/D polymorphism is limited in CAP. Low levels of ACE in serum are associated with the disease severity, which is reflected by the clinical scores. Within innate immunity, there are many genetic variations that are associated with the susceptibility to and outcome from pathogen-specific CAP. IL-6 and IL-10 polymorphisms are associated with an increased susceptibility of acquiring severe CAP or CAP in young patients. IL-6 and IL-10 are markers as well as predictors of disease severity. The TLR2 2477 A allele and the Fcgamma-RIIa R131 genotype are associated with an increased susceptibility to Haemophilus influenzae CAP, while TLR5 392stop and Fcgamma-RIIa R131 are associated with an increased susceptibility to (severe) pneumococcal pneumonia. Fc?-RIIa H131 (wild type) and MBL sufficient genotypes are associated with an increased susceptibility to CAP caused by Legionella pneumophila or Mycoplasma pneumoniae. MBL genotypes code for MBL serum levels, and MBL deficiency is associated with an increased susceptibility for acquiring additional viral infections in patients with existing CAP. Thus, the answer to the central question of this thesis - are variations in innate immunity are associated with the susceptibility to and outcome of CAP - is yes, but only in a pathogen-specific manner.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['In observational studies on causal associations, comparison groups (e.g. groups of treated and untreated subjects) are likely to differ on prognostic characteristics. Such incomparability will bias the association under study, which is referred to as confounding. The studies presented in this thesis focused on the reporting and quantification of observed and unobserved confounding. In chapter 2 a review of methods to quantify observed and unobserved confounding is presented. Then, in chapter 3, two reviews of the reporting of confounding in observational intervention studies were presented. A systematical literature search indicated that from 1985 through 2005 in only 9% of the papers on observational intervention studies confounding was addressed in title or abstract. A detailed investigation of current reporting in leading medical and epidemiological journals showed that out of eight pre-specified essential items in the reporting of confounding, on average only four were reported in the papers that were studied. The studies described in chapter 4 focused on observed confounding. First, it was shown in a study on influenza vaccine effectiveness, that pooling of observed confounders did not result in important residual confounding. In the second part of chapter 4, a numerical example indicated that subgroup effects could be confounded in both individual trials and individual patient data meta-analyses. Chapter 5 focused on methods to quantify unobserved confounding. First, two-stage sampling was used to assess impact of potential confounders, which were initially not observed. In this study, potential confounders (such as functional health status, smoking status, alcohol consumption, and educational level) did not affect the association between influenza vaccination and mortality risk. Secondly, a reference period for which the effect of influenza vaccination was known, namely summer, was used to adjust the observed vaccine effectiveness during an influenza epidemic for unobserved confounding. Adjustment for unobserved confounding reduced influenza vaccine effectiveness from 42% to 31%. Then, several sensitivity analyses to estimate the potential impact of an unobserved confounder were reviewed and applied in a study on influenza vaccine effectiveness. Finally, the potential for instrumental variables to study influenza vaccine effectiveness was assessed. All potential instrumental variables that were studied (i.e., use of antacid medication, a history of gout, a history of orthopaedic morbidity, and GP group practice characteristics) did not meet the assumptions of instrumental variable analysis. The final chapter provides a general discussion of the methods to quantify observed and unobserved confounding. This discussion then serves as a base for recommendations on the reporting and handling of confounding in observational causal studies.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Neurotrophic treatment of the degenerating auditory nerve; cochlear implants in deafened guinea pigs'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['To date, the cochlear implant is the most successful sensorineural prosthesis. The device consists of a small array with a number of electrodes implanted in the cochlea of profoundly hearing impaired people. Some people with an implant are able to use the telephone. Unfortunately, others hardly benefit from their cochlear implant. The large variability in the performance of cochlear implant recipients is an important motive for the research described in this thesis. A factor explaining the variability in the perceptual performance might be the degeneration of the auditory nerve that often occurs following the loss of the sensory cells in the cochlea: the hair cells. The principal aim of this thesis was to explore strategies that can prevent this degeneration. Guinea pigs were deafened with chemicals , which resulted in severe hair cell loss, a corresponding hearing loss of >55 dB, and a progressive degeneration of spiral ganglion cells (SGCs).We explored several strategies to prevent this degeneration of the auditory nerve. Chronic electrical stimulation (CES) of the cochlea was one of these strategies. CES did not affect the SGC density, nor the size and shape of the SGCs. This result indicates that frequent depolarization of SGCs as a result of electrical stimulation, does not by itself prevent degeneration of SGCs. Another strategy to prevent the degeneration of SGC was the continuous intracochlear infusion of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). This BDNF treatment was started two weeks after deafening, when degeneration of SGCs had set in. The SGC packing densities in the BDNF-treated cochleae were significantly larger than those in untreated cochleae. SGCs treated with BDNF were larger than SGCs in normal-hearing guinea pigs and the number of layers in the myelin sheath of BDNF-treated SGC was reduced as compared to the number of layers in the myelin sheath of SGCs in normal-hearing guinea pigs. These morphological changes of SGCs might be related to the rapid loss of SGCs that has been reported by others to occur after cessation of BDNF treatment. However, in contrast to these others, we demonstrated that the protective effect lasted at least two weeks after cessation of the neurotrophic treatment, and that the SGCs remained functional. This is a promising result for future clinical application of neurotrophic factors in implanted human cochleae. The cannula that was used to apply the BDNF in the experiments described above creates a possible route of access for bacteria and therefore we explored a new route of delivery. We demonstrated that when BDNF was delivered on the round window of the cochlea with an absorbable gelatin sponge, the rate of degeneration of SGCs in the basal turn of the cochlea was reduced. This result is promising because this mode of application of neurotrophins is clinically safer. In our last experiment we developed a behavioral model that can be used to demonstrate that deafened guinea pigs are able to detect electric pulse trains. Such a model is helpful to investigate whether preserving SGCs from degeneration affects the detection of electric pulse trains.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['The role of PPARgamma in lipid metabolism'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Due to a sedentary lifestyle and an energy-dense diet the prevalence obesity rapidly increases in industrialized countries. This is a major health concern as adiposity is highly associated with major complications such as insulin resistance, type II diabetes, dyslipidemia and hypertension (components of the metabolic syndrome). Although diet and environmental intervention (i.e. caloric restriction and increased physical exercise, respectively) can prevent or delay the onset of the metabolic syndrome, this is not always sufficient and the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome keeps on rising. This underscores the importance of the development of novel therapies to treat metabolic disorders thereby reducing morbidity and mortality. Interestingly, not only an excess of fat, but also the absence of fat as found in subjects with lipodystrophy is associated with these complications. So, apparently a normal amount and/or distribution of fat are required for the maintenance of whole body metabolism. The ligand-inducible nuclear receptor Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor gamma (PPARgamma) plays an important role in the differentiation, maintenance and function of adipocytes. In addition, it is the molecular target of the insulin-sensitizing thiazoledinedione (TZD) drugs. Although these TZDs were promising drugs ameliorating insulin sensitivity, some of them have already been discarded because of undesired side-effects. Nowadays, research focuses on specific PPARgamma modulators, so called SPARMs, which in theory would only exert the beneficial effects. The development of these SPARMs requires a better understanding of PPARgamma function in metabolism and its role in modulating insulin sensitivity. For this reason we studied the functional consequences of rare naturally occurring PPARgamma mutations in patients with familial partial lipodystrophy type 3 (FPLD3). FPLD3 is characterized by the loss of subcutaneous fat from the extremities and accumulation of excess fat in the intra-abdominal region and associated with metabolic complications (e.g. insulin resistance and dyslipidemia). We report a novel PPARgamma mutation (R194W) located in the DNA binding domain. As this residue contacts the phosphate backbone of DNA, disruption of this residue impaired DNA binding resulting in a transcriptionally inactive protein. In addition we showed that another FPLD3-associated PPARgamma mutation (R425C) located in the ligand binding domain affects PPARgamma function on multiple levels (e.g. ligand and DNA binding) resulting in reduced transcriptional activity. To gain more insights in the molecular mechanisms underlying the TZD effects we performed a transcriptome analysis in human mature adipocytes treated with TZDs. Using this approach we discovered two novel genes (i.e. GPR81 and RNF125) regulated by TZD-mediated PPARgamma activation. GPR81 encodes the antilipolytic G-protein-coupled receptor 81 that is exclusively expressed in adipocytes. Activation of this receptor results in the inhibition of adipocyte lipolysis. One of the beneficial effects of TZDs is a lowering of plasma free fatty acids thereby improving insulin sensitivity. We propose therefore that PPARgamma-mediated regulation of GPR81 contributes to this effect. RNF125 is an E3-ubiqituin ligase. The substrate for RNF125 in adipocytes is currently unknown and therefore the relevance of the regulation of this gene in adipocytes by TZDs needs to be further explored. In conclusion, our studies contribute to a better understanding of PPARgamma function and its role in lipid metabolism.'],\n",

In another project, a data analysis was conducted to estimate production loss due to new subclinical mastitis in Dutch dairy herds. The estimates were used as input values to assist in developing a dynamic and stochastic bio-economic model of intramammary infection. The model simulated the major pathogens in the Netherlands using recent knowledge on the dynamics of pathogen-specific intramammary infection to calculate the cost of these infections. Two systematic meta-analysis reviews were conducted; the first quantified the preventive effect of dry period interventions against new intramammary infections. The second meta-analysis quantified the cure rate of existing intramammary infections at dry off using dry cow therapy. Subsequently, the bio-economic model was updated to include the dynamics of pathogen-specific intramammary infections in the dry period. Thereafter, an economic evaluation of applied dry period interventions was carried out based on the meta-analyses studies.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['This thesis concerns the treatment of stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and limited disease small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). We described a systematic review on the clinical results of radiotherapy, combined or not with chemotherapy, for inoperable NSCLC stage III with the aim to define the best sequence of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. We concluded that concurrent chemoradiotherapy demonstrated increased efficacy over sequential chemo-radiotherapy and should be the treatment of choice. The 5-year survival has increased from about 7% for radiotherapy alone to 10% for sequential and to about 15% for concurrent chemoradiotherapy. However, the concurrent chemo-radiotherapy schedules were associated with higher toxicity as compared to sequential therapy with the same drug doses. We investigated the influence of the waiting time for radiotherapy, i.e. the interval between end of induction chemotherapy and start radiotherapy, on the rate of tumour growth for patients with NSCLC stage III. We demonstrated that in the waiting time rapid tumour progression occurs as result of accelerated tumour cell proliferation. The mean waiting time was 80.3 days; in this period the median tumour volume increased with a factor of about 6. As a consequence, the gain obtained with induction chemotherapy with regards to volume reduction was lost in the waiting time for radiotherapy. Stage III NSCLC is correlated with tumour volumes in excess of 100 cm3. The tumour control probability analysis revealed that for tumours of that size local cure is almost impossible with the doses usually applied in radiotherapy. Due to the accelerated cell proliferation observed, we recommend that radiotherapy should start as soon as possible, preferably within two to three weeks after the last chemotherapy cycle. We investigated whether gemcitabine (dFdC) may cause radiosensitization. The radiosensitizing effect of dFdC might be less in normal healthy tissue and more restricted to undifferentiated tumour cells, making it a tumour-selective radiosensitizer. We tested whether dFdC acted as radiosensitizer in undifferentiated and well-differentiated rat tumours and on rat foot skin. We used undifferentiated L44 lung tumours in BN rats and MLL prostate tumours in Copenhagen rats, and well-differentiated L42 lung tumours in WAG/Rij rats. Radiosensitization was observed in the undifferentiated tumours but not in the well-differentiated tumour or the skin. Our data support further trials to evaluate the usefulness of dFdC as radiosensitizer in undifferentiated tumours. We described the results of a phase II national multicentre study with weekly docetaxel/cisplatin and concurrent thoracic radiotherapy followed, whenever possible, by surgery in patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer. The 3-years overall survival was 38% and this is an encouraging result. We analysed the treatment results of our patients’ population with limited-disease small-cell lung cancer. They were treated with chemotherapy only and chemotherapy combined with radiotherapy. The treatment schemes with curative intention were sequential and concurrent chemoradiotherapy, both combined with prophylactic cranial irradiation. Our results indicate that the concurrently applied chemoradiotherapy resulted in longer median survival time and higher overall survival than sequential chemoradiotherapy, chemotherapy with palliative radiotherapy or chemotherapy only.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['This thesis describes the results of our research regarding the expression and function of granzymes and serpins in immune cells and in tumours. Granzymes are cytotoxic proteases that are expressed by cytotoxic lymphocytes. The family of human granzymes consists of five members: GrA, GrB, GrH, GrK, and GrM. Upon perforin-dependent entry into a target cell they can all induce cell death by cleaving specific intracellular substrates. Serpins, on the other hand, can inhibit the proteolytic activity of cognate proteases and thereby fulfil a regulatory function in many processes. The novel findings regarding granzymes and serpins can be divided into three themes. First, the expression and regulation of two granzymes by specific immune cells has been investigated. This is of importance to determine which cell populations can initiate cell death by one particular granzyme. We showed that human mast cells produce and release GrB upon activation. These results propose an additional function for mast cells, whereas they preclude the use of GrB as an exclusive marker for cytotoxic lymphocytes. Using a novel specific antibody, we determined that NK cells, NKT cells, gamma-delta T cells, and CD8+ T cells express GrM. This suggests that GrM plays a role in both the innate and the adaptive immune response. Second, the mechanism underlying GrM-induced cell death has been investigated as well as a possibility for tumour cells to evade GrM-induced cell death. Novel substrates of GrM have been identified using a proteomics approach, including the cytoskeleton proteins alpha-tubulin and ezrin. Cleavage of these proteins disturbs their function and likely contributes to GrM-induced cell death. Biochemical analysis revealed that SERPINB4 inhibits the proteolytic activity of GrM. SERPINB4 traps GrM into a typical serpin-target protease SDS-stable complex and impairs hydrolysis of GrM-substrates. Since SERPINB4 is highly expressed by certain tumours, these results suggest that SERPINB4 expression constitutes a novel mechanism by which tumour cells evade GrM-induced cell death. Third, the expression of two serpins by specific cell types and corresponding tumours has been studied. In addition, the use of these serpins as tumour marker has been analysed. Normal squamous epithelium highly expresses SERPINB13, whereas this is strongly down-regulated in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). Moreover, down-regulation of SERPINB13 protein expression by HNSCC associates with a poor clinical outcome of the patients. SERPINB8 is expressed by normal neuroendocrine cells as well as neuroendocrine pancreas tumours. Since expression by the latter one is highly sensitive and specific, SERPINB8 can be used as an additional diagnostic marker for neuroendocrine tumours of the pancreas. These novel insights may lead to improvement in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with immunological disorders, viral infections, and/or cancer.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['For this thesis fundamental research was performed on the metabolic adaptations found in parasites. Studying the adaptations in parasite metabolisms leads to a better understanding of parasite bioenergetics and can also result in the identification of new anti-parasitic drug targets. We focussed on parasite specific adaptations in energy metabolism in the mitochondria of Fasciola hepatica and Trypanosoma brucei, and in the hydrogenosomes of Trichomonas vaginalis. As many parasites produce acetate as an end product of their energy metabolism, whereas their mammalian hosts do not, acetate production might provide an interesting drug target in many parasites. Recently, the acetate-producing enzyme present in the unicellular parasite T. brucei was identified. Unexpectedly no homolog of this T. brucei enzyme is present in the completely sequenced genome of T. vaginalis. However, we did identify another, unrelated, candidate enzyme in this genome, and proved this gene to be the acetate-producing enzyme in the hydrogenosomes of T. vaginalis. Furthermore, we showed that a homolog of this gene is also involved in acetate production in the parasitic worm F. hepatica and that these enzymes are conserved in many different types of parasites, but are absent in mammals. Therefore, we identified a new drug target, with the potential to target many parasitic infections. A recently reported adaptation in the acetate-forming, aerobic mitochondria of procyclic T. brucei is the absence of a functional Krebs cycle. This recent finding is, however, not compatible with older literature. The discrepancy might be explained by the fact that older studies often used fresh isolates of T. brucei, whereas recent reports use long-term in vitro cultured trypanosomes. We studied glucose catabolism in procyclic trypanosomes directly after isolation from their natural environment, the midgut of the tsetse fly, as well as in a T. brucei strain that has only been passaged a few times since its field-isolation. These experiments confirmed the absence of a functional Krebs cycle in procyclic trypanosomes. Furthermore, they demonstrated that bloodstream form short-stumpy T. brucei produce acetate in their mitochondria. This mitochondrial acetate is apparently a pre-adaptation of these parasites to their next host, the tsetse fly. A different type of metabolic adaptation is found in the acetate producing, anaerobically functioning, mitochondria of adult F. hepatica worms, which use an alternative electron acceptor named rhodoquinone (RQ). RQ is found in relatively few species, among which many parasitic worms, and is not present in mammals. Since the biosynthetic pathway of this electron acceptor was unexplored and presumably involves at least one parasite specific enzyme, we performed studies on the biosynthetic pathway of RQ. This resulted in the identification of two enzymes involved in RQ biosynthesis. Both of these enzymes are also required for the biosynthesis of the structurally similar quinone ubiquinone (UQ). UQ is present in nearly all organisms, including mammals. Our studies provide the first evidence that RQ biosynthesis occurs via part of the biosynthetic pathway of UQ and show that demethoxy-ubiquinone (HQ) is the last common precursor for both these quinones.'],\n",

Many therapies have been tried over time, but none of them thus far has succeeded in significantly improving the functional recovery rate in horses after suffering from a tendon injury. The healing trajectory of tendon injuries can be divided in three partially overlapping phases: the inflammation phase, the proliferative phase and the maturation phase. These phases are charactersied by biological porcesses specific to the phase of healing. Up to now very little attempts have been made to distinguish between these phases when applying a therapy to an injured tendon. In this thesis a specific therapy for each of the stages was studied, although it is acknowledged that therapies might exhibit effects in more than one phase of the healing trajectory. During the inflammatory phase there is an initial enlargement of original the lesion due to proteolytic and biomechanical influences. In an in vitro mechanical study it was shown that this lesion propagation after tendon injury may be mitigated by immobilisation during the early phase of repair, although in vitro work remains necesarry to confirm these findings. The proliferative phase is characterised by cell proliferation and synthesis of extracellular matrix components, such as collagen and glycosaminoglycans. These processes can possibly be enhanced by treatment with platelet rich plasma (PRP), an autologous concentrate of growth factor containing platelets. PRP treatment was evaluated in a blinded placebo-controlled experimental study, in which artificially induced tendon lesions were treated with PRP or placebo and tissue was harvested after 24 weeks. PRP improevd biochemical, biomechanical and histological properies of the treated tendons. Doppler ultrasonography revealed large differences in vascularisation between treated and untreated tendons. Computerised Ultrasonography was used to monitor the healing process and appeared capable of predicting outcome at a relatively early stage of the healing process and revealed clues about some of the mechanisms of action. Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy (ESWT), a technique based on physical intervention, was used in vivo on healthy equine tendons. It could be shown that, after an initial boost of metabolic activity in the tendon tissue, there was a long-term (6 weeks after treatment) negative effect on cell-matabolism. Further, a rather severe disorganisation of the normal tendon architecture. Both findings warrant caution in the clinical use of this technique, but might also explain the positive effects ESWT appears to have on more chronic tendon lesions. The thesis concludes that a staged approach for the treatment of tendon injuries is likely to improve the final prognosis of horses that are recoverring from a tendon injury, although functional healing of tendon injuries will remain a problem in equestrian sports and additional research is necessary. Improvement of prognosis can be expected by a proactive approach including early immobilisation and application of novel intratendinous treatments.'],\n",

Aims -To evaluate the effectiveness of early-initiated high-dosed inhaled cortiocosteroids to prevent wheezing following RSV LRTI. -To increase knowledge about pathofysiological mechanisms underlying wheezing following RSV LRTI. Methods -Clinical, immunological and genetic characteristics of recurrent wheezing during the first 3 years following RSV LRTI and at age were compared. -A randomised controlled trial was performed to evaluate the effect of beclomethasone on recurrent wheeze. 243 infants were randomised and treated with beclomethasone or placebo during 3 months. The occurrence of wheeze was evaluated in the year following treatment. -Genetic studies were performed to identify genetic determinants of recurrent wheeze. Results -‘Early’ and ‘late’ recurrent wheeze following RSV LRTI represent distinct entities. -High-dosed and early-initiated inhaled corticosteroids during RSV LTRI have a modest and transient beneficial effect on recurrent wheeze. This effect is observed in non-ventilated infants only. -Recurrent wheeze following RSV LRTI relates to genetic variation in IL19 en IL20 genes. Conclusion -The use of inhaled corticosteroids should not be advocated in all infants hospitalised for RSV LRTI, but may be considered in non-ventilated infants. -IL10 family cytokines appear to have a central role in virus-induced wheeze following RSV LRTI. Future research Replication and functional studies are needed to confirm the role of IL10 like cytokines in recurrent wheeze following RSV LRTI. Pharmacogenetic studies are needed to evaluate the interaction between genetic background and treatment effect of inhaled corticosteroids on infant wheeze.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['It regularly happens that medications are found to cause severe adverse effects that remained undetected during premarketing research. From the perspective of the patient, the public and drug manufacturers there is a need for better tools for earlier detection, quantification and mechanistic unraveling of associations between drug exposure and adverse health outcomes in patient populations. A tool that is considered to be valuable for this purpose is a database with patient-oriented data on medication exposure and laboratory test results collected in clinical care. The objective of this thesis was to investigate the value of laboratory data collected in patient care for drug safety research. We focused on drug-induced thrombocytopenia as an example. First, we investigated the association between thrombocytopenia and exposure to drugs most often reported to cause thrombocytopenia. For this study we used data from the PHARMO Record Linkage System. To identify patients with thrombocytopenia hospital discharge diagnoses were used. An increased risk for thrombocytopenia following exposure to beta-lactam antibiotics was found. The expected increase in risk for thrombocytopenia could not be confirmed for the other medications investigated. This may be the result of limited statistical power, in which incomplete identification of patients with drug-induced thrombocytopenia by using hospital discharge diagnoses could play a role. Following-up this study we compared the use of hospital discharge diagnoses for thrombocytopenia with the use of platelet measurements as strategy for case-finding potential drug-induced thrombocytopenia from health care data. We found that using platelet measurements is a more sensitive approach for this purpose. However a low platelet count was observed to be non-specific for potential drug-induced thrombocytopenia. For this study we used data from the Utrecht Patient Oriented Database (UPOD). UPOD is a recently established database for (pharmaco-)epidemiological research, encompassing automated data on laboratory test results, medication exposure, hospital discharge diagnoses, medical procedures and patient demographics for all patients treated at the UMC Utrecht. By using data from UPOD we performed three studies concerning different aspects of drug-induced thrombocytopenia: the incidence and relative risk of chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia, a biomarker for the mechanism of chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia and compliance with recommendations for monitoring the platelet count for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. We respectively found that the cytostatic drugs carboplatin, gemcitabine and paclitaxel are associated with the highest risk for thrombocytopenia in oncology patients treated in clinical practice, platelet size indices can not be used to distinguish bone marrow and immune-related causes of chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia and compliance to recommendations to monitor for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia in patients treated with low molecular weight heparin is low. We concluded that linking laboratory and medication data with in a research database is a valuable tool for investigating the safety of drugs in patient populations, including the investigation of the incidence, risk factors and monitoring for adverse drug reactions that can be detected with a biochemical test (such as drug-induced blood disorders) and the identification of potential biomarkers for adverse drug reactions. The knowledge from this research is valuable in maximizing the benefits of effective medications in patients treated in clinical practice.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Bariatric surgery is the only treatment option for individuals who have clinically severe obesity and are at the high risk for obesity-related mortality and co-morbidity. In order to get more insight in the effect of laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding on reflux, esophageal motility and gastric function, we started our studies in morbidly obese patients who were candidates for laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding in the St Antonius Hospital in Nieuwegein. The effect of laparoscopic gastric banding (LAGB) on gastroesophageal reflux was studied in 26 patients. They were assessed by a questionnaire for symptom analysis, 24-hour pH monitoring, endoscopy and barium swallows, preoperatively, at 6 weeks and at 6 months after operation. It was concluded that LAGB decreases gastroesophageal reflux if there is no pouch formation during follow-up. We studied the effect of LAGB on esophageal motility and lower esophageal sphincter functioning. Twenty-nine morbidly obese patients underwent conventional manometry preoperatively, six weeks postoperatively before and after filling the band and at six months postoperatively. We concluded that adjustable gastric band placement causes an increase in LES pressure and high pressure zone length. It decreases reflux symptoms on the short term but this effect appears not to be related with an effect on LES pressure or length. Band placement on the short term does not disturb propagation of esophageal contractions. The role of gastric emptying in the mechanism of weight loss and early satiety was studied in a series of patients who were scintigraphically investigated before and after LAGB. Sixteen patients undergoing LAGB underwent preoperatively and at six months postoperatively a gastric emptying study. It was concluded that LAGB seemed not to affect gastric emptying. Neither a relation between postoperative gastric emptying rate and weight loss, nor between early satiety and weight loss was found. Therefore, it is unlikely that gastric emptying plays a role in the mechanism of weight loss. The occurrence of esophageal dilatation after LAGB was investigated in 45 patients. They were assessed for the development of esophageal dilatation by standardised barium swallow studies carried out after the operation and after a mean follow-up period of 39.3 months. It was concluded that LAGB causes esophageal dilatation in about half of the patients. This dilatation is correlated with symptoms and is partly reversible after emptying of the band. We retrospectively analyzed the results of the LAGB procedure for morbid obesity in 411 patients. It was concluded that three quarters of the patients with morbid obesity who received LAGB surgery had achieved and sustained weight loss at 2 years following surgery. We performed a systematic review on the effect of LAGB on gastroesophageal reflux and esophageal motility. MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched for relevant studies on patients undergoing adjustable gastric banding. It was concluded that LAGB has anti-reflux properties resulting in resolution or improvement of reflux symptoms, normalized pH monitoring results and a decrease of esophagitis. However, worsening or newly developed reflux symptoms and esophagitis are found in a subset of patients during longer follow-up.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Our limited knowledge of the expected life spans of granulocytes and T cells during health and disease hampers our understanding of the functioning of the immune system. Using stable isotope labeling we estimated the average life spans of human circulating granulocytes to be 6 days. This estimate was 10-fold higher than suggested in previous reports, supporting the emerging concept that neutrophils participate in complex long-term processes, such as immune regulation and recirculation. Since life span estimates of kinetically heterogeneous cell populations is labeling-time dependent, a new modeling strategy was introduced to fit average life spans independent of the labeling period. Deuterium labeling in human adults revealed a low daily production of naive T cells. Whereas naive T cells lived on average 6.0 (naive CD4+) and 9.4 years (naive CD8+), the few naive T cells that were recently produced had an even longer life expectancy. These data are incompatible with the existence of a substantial short-lived population of recent thymic emigrants in human adults. In contrast, a considerable thymic output was observed in mice. In addition, thymic emigrants lived as long as the average murine naive T cell in the periphery (48 and 83 days for naive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, respectively), suggesting that the murine naive T-cell pool is kinetically homogeneous, which is incompatible with the co-existence of short-lived thymic emigrants and long-lived truly naive T cells. The different life expectancy of recently produced naive T cells in adult mice and men suggests different homeostatic mechanisms of naive T cells in the two species. Indeed, thymectomy experiments and TREC analyses in ageing mice revealed that almost all murine naive T cells represent thymic emigrants, whereas TREC analysis in ageing humans strongly suggests that the majority of newly produced human naive T cells is derived from peripheral proliferation. Since the mechanism of naive T-cell maintenance is fundamentally different in mice and men, this will influence the diversity of the TCR repertoire of the species. The difference in naive T-cell dynamics suggests that laboratory mice, which are worldwide used as a model to study T-cell dynamics in men, are not a good model to study naive T-cell homeostasis in humans. Chronic immune activation in HIV-1 infection plays an important role in CD4+ T-cell depletion. Using CD70Tg mice, we showed that even in the context of substantial thymic output, like in young children, chronic immune activation can lead to severe naive T-cell depletion. In human adults with a much lower thymic output, even moderately enhanced priming rates may lead to severe T-cell depletion. Collectively, these data shed a new light on the dynamics of granulocytes and T cells and point to a serious limitation regarding extrapolation of insights from mouse to man and vice versa.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['ATP-binding cassette (ABC) multidrug transporters are drug efflux pumps located in the plasma membrane that utilize the energy of ATP hydrolysis to extrude a wide spectrum of endogenous and exogenous compounds from cells, including numerous (anticancer) drugs and/or their metabolites. The studies described in this thesis focus on the pharmacological functions of the ABC transporters: P-glycoprotein (P-gp/ABCB1), the Multidrug Resistance Proteins 2 and 3 (MRP2/ABCC2 and MRP3/ABCC3) and the Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP/ABCG2). Most results presented in this thesis were obtained by studying single and combination ABC multidrug transporter knockout mice. As ABC multidrug transporters do not only have very broad, but also substantially overlapping substrate specificities, they can often partially, or sometimes even fully, compensate for the loss of each other. Combination ABC drug transporter knockout mice are therefore invaluable tools to study the separate roles and functional overlap of ABC multidrug transporters. We generated and characterized combination P-gp/Mrp2 knockout mice and used these to assess the distinct roles of P-gp and Mrp2 in the pharmacokinetics of the anticancer drug paclitaxel. Although paclitaxel is an excellent P-gp substrate, Mrp2 was found to almost exclusively mediate the excretion of paclitaxel from the liver into the bile, whereas P-gp had little effect. This finding is especially interesting because Mrp2 was thus far thought to mainly affect organic anionic drugs in vivo. However, we show that Mrp2 can also be a major determinant of the pharmacokinetic behavior of highly lipophilic anti-cancer drugs, even in the presence of other efficient transporters. P-gp and BCRP combination knockout mice enabled us to demonstrate that both multidrug transporters act in concert at the blood-brain barrier in restricting the brain penetration of the novel tyrosine kinase inhibitor anticancer drugs dasatinib and sorafenib. Brain penetration of dasatinib was primarily restricted by P-gp, whereas loss of BCRP had no effect. However, when both transporters were absent a disproportionate increase in brain penetration of dasatinib was observed. In contrast, for sorafenib it was the other way around, i.e. absence of P-gp had no effect while BCRP deficiency resulted in markedly elevated brain levels. Again, simultaneous loss of both transporters resulted in a highly increased brain penetration. When we combined dasatinib with the dual P-gp and BCRP inhibitor elacridar we found that the brain penetration in wild-type mice could be increased to P-gp/BCRP knockout levels. These findings might be clinically relevant for patients with intracranial tumors, as concomitant administration of an inhibitor of P-gp and ABCG2 with dasatinib, sorafenib and possibly other tyrosine kinase inhibitors might result in better therapeutic responses in these patients. In conclusion, the studies described in this thesis demonstrate the power of combination ABC multidrug transporter knockout mouse models to study the pharmacological functions of ABC multidrug transporters. We expect that combination ABC transporter knockout mice will be extensively used as preclinical research tools.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Immunophenotyping of hereditary breast cancer'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Hereditary breast cancer runs in families where several family members in different generations are affected. Most of these breast cancers are caused by mutations in the high penetrance genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 which account for about 5% of all breast cancers. However, mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 may be missed, and small families and sometimes insufficient medical records may cause uninformative family history. This thesis aimed to investigate the immunoprofile of hereditary breast cancers caused by germline mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes in order to identify patients and families eligible for mutation screening. In addition, such studies on hereditary precursors could help to better understand hereditary breast carcinogenesis and identify new therapeutic targets. We started with evaluating a panel of clinicopathological variables to classify breast cancers as hereditary or sporadic using a multivariate approach. Most of the investigated markers were expressed in line with earlier data. However, we were the first to describe the high expression of EGFR in BRCA1 and BRCA2 related breast cancers. In addition, the observed high cyclin A expression is another useful proliferation marker in BRCA1 related breast cancers, and has been herewith established for the first time. Although our data were based on only five cases of BRCA2-related breast cancers, the cyclin D1 expression in these tumours was remarkably high. As such, most invasive breast carcinomas can be classified as sporadic or BRCA1 related with a high degree of certainty using a decision tree based on age, Ki67 and EGFR. Furthermore, we are the first to report that in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers the immunoprofile of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), a premalignant lesion, parallels the accompanying invasive cancer lesion, underlining that DCIS is probably a direct precursor lesion in these patients. In addition, crucial carcinogenetic events leading to these phenotypes apparently occur at an early stage in hereditary predisposed patients, most likely even before the stage of DCIS. We describe the novel finding of loss of expression of FANCD2, a Fanconi anaemia gene previously implicated in breast cancer in mice, in hereditary and sporadic invasive breast cancer, indicating that somatic inactivating (epi)genetic events in FANCD2 may occur in both sporadic and hereditary breast carcinogenesis. Our results do however not indicate that somatic (epi)genetic changes in FANCD2 are a frequent secondary carcinogenetic event in BRCA1 germline mutated patients. The expression of HIF-1?, the key regulator of the hypoxia response, in hereditary breast cancer is for the first time reported in comparison with sporadic breast cancer. 90% of BRCA1 germline mutation related breast cancers showed overexpression of HIF-1?, a percentage significantly higher than in sporadic controls. The overexpression of HIF-1? in BRCA1 related breast cancers is a frequent event and is likely hypoxia regulated, suggesting that the HIF-1? pathway plays a role in the BRCA-1 carcinogenesis and progression. All these findings will lead to improved discrimination of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 related breast cancer. Furthermore, the new biomarkers may serve as therapeutic targets for BRCA1 and BRCA2 related breast cancers.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Coronaviruses (CoVs; order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae) are viruses exceptionally prone to genetic evolution through the continual accumulation of mutations and by homologous recombination between related members. CoVs are organised into three antigenic groups of which group 1 is subdivided in subgroups 1a and 1b, the former including highly related viruses such as feline coronaviruses (FCoVs), canine coronaviruses (CCoVs), transmissible gastroenteritis virus of swine (TGEV) and its derivative porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCoV). The scope of this thesis was to investigate the epidemiological, evolutionary and pathobiological features of CCoVs, which are paradigmatic of coronaviruses’ evolution and complexity. To date, two different CCoV genotypes are known, CCoV types I (CCoV-I) and II (CCoV-II), that share up to 96% of genetic identity, being highly divergent only in the spike (S) protein gene. In addition, CCoV type I displays a novel open reading frame (ORF), ORF3, coding for a putative glycosylated protein which is likely secreted from the infected cells. By using molecular methods (real-time RT-PCR assays), the two CCoV genotypes were commonly detected in the feces of dogs with diarrhea, causing frequently simultaneous infections of the same dogs. Both CCoV genotypes have been associated with mild, self-limiting enteritis in pups. In 2005, a highly virulent variant of CCoV type II (strain CB/05) was reported in Italy which caused systemic disease with fatal outcome in pups. A CCoV-II strain was detected at high titers in the internal organs of the dead puppies by real-time RT-PCR. Experimental infection of seronegative pups with the viral isolate reproduced the disease with occurrence of severe clinical signs, including pyrexia, anorexia, depression, vomiting, diarrhea and leukopenia. The evolution of CCoVs and TGEV is strictly interconnected. In fact, it has been postulated that TGEV originated from CCoV-II through a cross-species transmission, which is supported by the high genetic relatedness between the two viruses and by the presence of ORF3 remnants in CCoV-II and TGEV genomes. Novel CCoV-II strains were isolated that originated from a double recombination event with TGEV occurring in the 5’ end of the S-protein gene. Accordingly, genotype II has been further divided into two subtypes, CCoV-IIa and CCoV-IIb, including extant and TGEV-like CCoVs, respectively. Future investigations should provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms responsible for the change in pathobiology of CCoV and into the pathogenic and immunological aspects of CCoV-induced systemic disease. At the same time, constant epidemiological surveillance will help a timely identification of additional CoV strains with novel genetic and biological properties. The lessons still to be learned will be valuable to predict and counter changes in coronavirus pathogenicity in general and hence, they will be of both human clinical and veterinary importance.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Improving radionuclide therapy in prostate cancer patients with metastatic bone pain'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Bone seeking radiopharmaceuticals are indicated in cancer patients with multiple painful skeletal metastases. The majority of these patients are hormone-refractory prostate cancer patients in an advanced stage of their disease. Bone seeking radiopharmaceuticals relieve pain and improve the patients quality of life. The mostly used radiopharmaceuticals are 89SrCl2 (Metastron), 153Sm-EDTMP (Quadramet) and 186Re-HEDP. Differences between 89SrCl2, 153Sm-EDTMP and 186Re-HEDP were investigated. It was found that urinary excretion of activity is rapid in patients treated with 153Sm-EDTMP and 186Re-HEDP, in contrast to 89SrCl2. Together with differences in biodistribution and physical decay this leads to differences in radiation burden to bystanders. The effective doses were <0.1 mSv for 89SrCl2, 0.3 mSv for 186Re-HEDP and 1.6 mSv for 153Sm-EDTMP. In all cases however the calculated effective doses for bystanders were well below the recommended values. A treatment guideline was drawn using these data. In order to improve the patients’ clinical condition it may be beneficial to combine different treatment modalities. This may possibly lead to additive or even synergistic effects. In prostate cancer patients bisphosphonates are used to treat and prevent so called skeletal related events (fractures, hypercalcaemia, spinal cord compression). This may add to the palliative effect of bone seeking radiopharmaceuticals. Nevertheless, the European label of 153Sm-EDTMP includes the contra-indication that “it should not be used concurrently with other bisphosponates if an interference is shown on the 99mTc-labeled bisphosphonate bone scan”. This contra-indication is based on the hypothesis that as both drugs interact at the hydroxyapatite crystal surface of the skeleton, competition might exist for uptake by bone. However, it was shown that the combined use of zoledronic acid has no effect on the uptake of 153Sm-EDTMP in skeletal metastases of hormone-refractory prostate carcinoma. Combined treatment with 153Sm-EDTMP and zoledronic acid was both feasible and safe. The efficacy data on the patients treated in this phase I setting were regarded as pilot phase II data. Although the study comprised small numbers the results confirmed the utility of bone markers (bone specific alkaline phosphatase [BAP], procollagen type I N propeptide [PINP], N-terminal type I collagen peptide [NTX]) as predictors of clinical outcome. And they were first tested in the treatment monitoring of bone seeking radiopharmaceuticals. Bone markers may well prove to be very useful predictors of response in the treatment with bone seeking radiopharmaceuticals. They should be used in future trials. Another combination of 188Re-HEDP and capecitabine (Xeloda) was tested in a phase I capecitabine dose-escalation study. Capecitabine was used as a radiation sensitizer. It proved to be feasible and safe. Phase II efficacy testing using the maximum tolerable dose of 2500 mg/m2/day capecitabine in combination with 37 MBq/kg 188Re-HEDP is underway. It was concluded that patients treated with 89SrCl2, 186Re-HEDP or 153Sm-EDTMP do not lead to unacceptable radiation burden to health care workers and patients’ families. Combined treatment regimens (153Sm-EDTMP / zoledronic acid and 188Re-HEDP / capecitabine) are feasible and safe. Bone markers seem to be good candidates to predict response.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is an inherited syndrome that is characterized by the occurrence of tumours of the parathyroid glands, gastroenteropancreatic tumours, pitui-tary gland adenomas, as well as adrenal adenomas and neuro-endocrine tumours, often at a young age. MEN1 tumours can be treated mostly by surgical methods. However, some tumours have malignant potential. Most patients require repeated surgery during their lifetime. MEN1 is caused by germ line mutations of the MEN1 gene. The MEN1 gene is a tumour suppressor gene. This means that both alleles in a cell need to be inactivated before a cell can develop into a tumour cell. The MEN1 gene encodes a protein termed menin. Menin is a nuclear protein that is involved in regulation of gene transcription, but possibly also DNA repair and replication. Menin can both be a co-activator and a co-repressor of gene transcription by recruiting proteins that modify histone proteins. Menin was found to be an integral component of a complex that has histone methyl-transferase activity directed at lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4). H3K4 trimethy-lation (H3K4me3) is associated with activation of transcription. To explore the function of menin and hence the pathogenesis of MEN1, we studied the amino acid sequence of menin. We found that menin contains a potential nuclear receptor interaction motif. The nuclear receptor family consists of 48 receptors for steroid hormones, vitamins A and D and other lipophilic agents. It is known that nuclear receptors can play a role in endocrine tumourigenesis. By protein interaction experiments, reporter assays and chromatin precipitation experiments, we found that menin can indeed bind to nuclear receptors and co-activate nuclear receptor function by recruiting H3K4-me3 activity to nuclear receptor target genes. Menin is also important for the biological function of nuclear receptors; in the absence of menin mouse embryonic fibroblasts fail to undergo PPARgamma dependent adipogenesis. In parathyroid adenomas from MEN1 patients, vitamin D receptor target genes are expressed at lower levels, suggesting that loss of menin could lead to decreased nuclear receptor activity. The connection of menin and nuclear receptors might offer new perspectives for future therapy for MEN1 patients.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder. Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most frequent type of human focal epilepsy. Despite ample availability of anti-epileptic dugs, about 30% of TLE patients are pharmaco-resistant. Surgical removal of the epileptogenic focus, which usually includes the hippocampus, may then be the therapy of choice. The etiology of TLE is largely unknown. One of the key mechanisms implicated is a disbalans between the excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters glutamate and GABA. There is compelling evidence that glutamate metabolism is impaired in TLE. Synaptically released glutamate is recycled in the glutamate-glutamine cycle, the local pathway in which neurons and glia cooperate. The cycle is essential to terminate the glutamatergic signal, thereby preventing excitotoxicity. Glutamate is taken up by glial cells, predominantly via excitatory amino acid transporter 2, where it is converted into non-toxic glutamine by the enzyme glutamine synthetase (GS). Glutamine transfer from astrocytes to neurons is probably mediated by neutral amino acid transporters. In the neuron, glutamine is deaminated to glutamate via phosphate-activated glutaminase. Glutamate is loaded in synaptic vesicles by specific vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUTs), prior to exocytosis. The overall aim of this thesis was to determine the role and contribution of components of the glutamate-glutamine cycle in the development and chronic phase of TLE. Expression of GS, putative glutamine transporters (SNAT1,2,3, ASCT2), and VGLUTs were investigated in human biopsy material obtained during surgical resection of the affected hippocampus. TLE patients without (non-HS) and with (HS) hippocampal sclerosis were compared with autopsy controls. Expression of GS, but also of SNAT1,2, and VGLUT1, was decreased in the hippocampus of HS patients, indicating severe impairment of glutamate metabolism. The expression pattern of SNAT3 and the absence of ASCT2 expression in the human hippocampus argue against a role of these transporters in glutamine efflux from glial cells. Although human tissue is unique, studying the etiology of TLE requires animal studies. Therefore, the juvenile pilocarpine model was used to study early changes in glutamate-glutamine cycle components in the process leading to TLE. In this model, pilocarpine-injection induces acute prolonged seizures (status epilepticus). After a period of 15-18 weeks 44% of these animals developed spontaneous recurrent seizures. Interestingly, GS was the only component of the glutamate-glutamine cycle that progressively decreased before as well as after the occurrence of recurrent seizures. These early changes could be monitored in living animals by magnetic resonance spectroscopy and may be early markers of imminent epilepsy. Subsequently, we investigated the effect of reduced GS expression on seizure susceptibility in heterozygous GS knockout mice (GS+/-) with ~50% reduction of GS expression, thus mimicking the effects in human and animal TLE. These animals were subjected to hyperthermia-induced febrile seizures, which often are an early precipitating event in TLE patients. Febrile seizure susceptibility was increased in GS+/- mice compared to controls. Compensatory mechanisms of other components of the glutamate-glutamine cycle were not detected. Thus, GS is a key factor in regulating seizure susceptibility. These results open possibilities for the early non-invasive detection of TLE and development of new treatment strategies.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The past 4 years my research focussed on the identification, expression and function of surface-exposed LPXTG proteins and filamentous structures (also called pili or fimbriae) at the Enterococcus faecium cell wall. E. faecium is a commensal organism of the mammalian gastrointestinal tract, but the last two decades it has been recognized as an nosocomial pathogen causing wound infections, bacteremia, and endocarditis. Hospital-aqcuired (HA-) E. faecium isolates recovered from sites of infection and responsible for nosocomial outbreaks are multi-antibiotic resistant and therefore difficult to treat. The results I have obtained showed that the clinically relevant hospital-acquired E. faecium isolates were specifically enriched in five LPXTG surface proteins (Orf903, Orf904.5, Orf906.7, EcbA and SgrA) when compared to clinically non-relevant non-HA-E. faecium isolates. Both EcbA and SgrA LPXTG surface proteins were functionally characterized, and EcbA showed binding to collagen type V and SgrA to nidogen-2. The collagen type V and nidogen-2 molecules are components of the extracellular matrix, an entry site for pathogenic bacteria into the host. Furthermore, I was the first to identify the presence of surface-exposed pili in E. faecium. The genes of two of the four pilin gene clusters present in E. faecium TX0016 encoded two distinct types of surface-exposed pili, designated PilA and PilB. These pili were only expressed at 37C and not at 21C, suggesting that pili are specifically produced in a mammalian host, but not in the environment. The two surface proteins and expression of pili may provide HA-E. faecium with a selective advantage in the hospital setting and are potential targets for novel vaccines to combat nosocomial E. faecium infections.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Development of prosthetic knee joint technologies for children and youth with above-knee amputations'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Mobility and participation in physical activity is of primary importance for children with limb absence or loss. A prosthetic knee joint is an essential facilitator of this, providing controlled articulation to enable sitting, standing, and natural, safe and efficient movements during mobility. Despite recent and notable improvements in adult above-knee prosthetic technologies, prosthetic knee joints for children and youth provide only very basic functions. As such, in this thesis, structured design processes and empirically-driven biomechanical models were used to aid the design and development of novel knee control systems intended to improve elements of prosthetic knee joint function, while quantitative gait analysis and self-report measures were employed to assess functional outcomes. In this thesis an examination of the design considerations for selecting the type of prosthetic knee joint mechanism is provided, and the important functional requirements of paediatric prosthetic knees established. From this, a basis for configuring a simple single-axis mechanism to provide the advantageous functions of more complex, multi-linkage mechanisms, and the important elements of stance-phase control function were established. Subsequently, a novel stance-phase mechanism is presented and evaluated as part of a crossover design field trial utilizing a self-report measure. The results of long-term field-testing are also reported. In this thesis, guidelines for obtaining reliable intra-session measures of impaired gait using quantitative techniques, provided the basis for the quantitative gait assessments that were used to compare the gait performance of the new stance-phase controlled prosthetic knee joint and conventional high-end paediatric knee joint technologies. The latter part of the thesis examined the other aspect of prosthetic knee joint control, namely swing-phase control. A unique technical solution is presented that circumvents some of the problems of conventional fluid-based swing-phase controllers. The performance of a prototype of the new swing-phase control mechanism is evaluated during gait, involving a sample of young individuals with above-knee amputations. The final chapter provides a discussion and summary of this work and its broader implications, including application to other patient populations.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The research described in this thesis focused on two groups of anti-cancer agents. The group of ‘small’ molecules is represented by the vinca-alkaloids and the group of ‘large’ molecules is represented by the monoclonal antibody (mAb) trastuzumab. Both these groups require different analytical strategies. The bioanalysis of vinca-alkaloids In Chapter 2 different liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assays were developed for vinca-alkaloids. In Chapter 2.2 and 2.3 assays were developed for vinorelbine and its metabolite 4-O-deacetylvinorelbine. Vincristine in combination with actinomycin-D is the preferred therapy to treat children with Wilms’ tumor. To support a pharmacokinetic study in Malawi we have developed a bioanalytical LC-MS/MS assay for the quantification of these drugs (Chapter 2.4). As vincristine experiences high plasma protein binding and protein levels are altered in malnourishment, the free drug concentration is also of interest and therefore an assay was developed as well. As frequent venipuncture in children is difficult we investigated in Chapter 2.5 whether dried blood spots can be used to study the pharmacokinetics of vincristine and actinomycin-D. The sampling procedure can be simplified as samples can be obtained by a simple finger prick. Structural characterization of monoclonal antibodies In Chapter 3.1 we have used a novel quadrupole ion-mobility time-of-flight mass spectrometer to study the N-glycosylation of trastuzumab. The new instrument offers a fast way for structural elucidation and batch-to-batch comparison. In the studied batches the same glycoforms were found, however their relative amount differed between batches. The quantification of monoclonal antibodies For the quantification of mAbs different approaches were investigated as described in Chapter 4. Chapter 4.1 gives a literature overview of the bioanalytical assays of the currently licensed therapeutic mAbs. In Chapter 4.2 the possibilities of using LC-MS for the quantification of trastuzumab were investigated. In Chapter 4.3 a bioanalytical method for the bioanalysis of trastuzumab in human serum is described. Different approaches were investigated to extract trastuzumab from human serum. The LLOQ of this assay is 5 g/mL in human serum, enough to support therapeutic drug monitoring. In Chapter 4.4 the development and validation of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for trastuzumab quantification in human serum and plasma is described. The assay is very fast and specific with a validated LLOQ of 1.6 ng/mL. In Chapter 4.5 a novel approach of immunoassays is investigated; the precipitated enhanced immunoassay (PEIA). Conclusion For the bioanalysis of ‘small’ molecules LC-MS/MS is the analytical technique of first choice. We demonstrated that the dried blood spots strategy is very useful to execute pharmacokinetic studies with vincristine and actinomycin-D. It is reported that currently more than 100 therapeutic mAbs are in clinical development. Immunoassays can be expected to be the bioanalytical technique of first choice for this class of agents. However, a very specific catcher in the form of the antigen or anti-idiotype antibodies remains indispensable. Therefore, the search for alternatives will continue. The major challenge however is to obtain enough selectivity to find the ‘needle’ mAb in the ‘haystack’ of endogenous immunoglobulins.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The general aim of this thesis is to explore the possible mechanisms underlying the individual differences in brain structure and brain structure change in healthy adults and schizophrenia patients. For this purpose, Magnetic Resonance Imaging scans of the brain were acquired in schizophrenia patients, their relatives and healthy comparison subjects. Since all studies are conducted in relatives, we were able to disentangle genetic and environmental influences on the studied phenotypes. Taken together, these studies show that in adulthood the brain continues to be dynamic. In the longitudinal study of healthy participants we demonstrated that brain volume change during a 5-year period through the 3rd to 6th decade of life is heritable. Moreover, the degree of brain loss during that time period is inversely related to the level of intelligence. Interestingly, genes involved in brain loss over time overlap with genes for intelligence and differ from those related to absolute brain volume. Thus, it appears that continued brain maturation in adult life and intellectual development go hand in hand, and both are mediated by common genes. Regarding the progressive brain volume changes in schizophrenia, we conclude that a significant proportion of the progressive brain volume loss that we observed both in schizophrenia patients and their unaffected co-twins during a 5-year interval is at least partly attributable to genes that are implicated in the disease. This implicates that progressive brain tissue loss in schizophrenia can no longer be considered to be solely due to medication intake, smoking or outcome. Finding the (patho)physiological processes underlying these progressive brain changes in schizophrenia is of importance because this knowledge may ultimately enable us to halt or even reverse the disease process.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Verocytotoxogenic E. coli O157 (VTEC O157) and Campylobacter jejuni/coli are zoonotic pathogens of public health importance, which are commonly carried and shed by cattle. Control at farm level needed isto limit shedding and contamination of the environment and the human food chain. On- farm risk factors for shedding of both bacteria were identified. Cross-sectional studies revealed that VTEC O157 shedding was associated with low frequency of assessing the wetness of bedding, animals housed in large groups and wet bedding in enclosures. For Campylobacter indoor housing, presence of milking cows, less frequent emptying and cleaning of water troughs and drinking private water supply water increased the risk of shedding. A longitudinal study observed that groups of VTEC O157 and Campylobacter shedding animals were only intermittently positive and that indoor housing increased the risk of shedding both organisms, where frequent cleaning of water troughs and drinking water from public water supplies were associated with reduced shedding of Campylobacter. A randomised controlled trial (RCT) was conducted to assess the impact of removal of risk factors on VTEC O157. Dry bedding, stable rearing groups, a closed herd policy and no contact with cattle from other herds significantly reduced VTEC O157 on farms over a period of 4.5 months. When these results were collated with the risk factor studies, a 5-point zoonotic control plan was generated: frequent emptying and cleaning of water troughs, dry bedding in enclosures, maintain stable rearing groups, apply a closed herd policy and avoid direct contact between cattle from different herds. To encourage uptake of the zoonotic control plan, the likelihood of implementation on farms was investigated. A total of 1.5 years after the end of the RCT, ineffective measures were continued by 55% of farmers, where only 19% adopted new effective practices due to evidence of effect. Implementation of all practices had financial costs, but ineffective practices provided no disease-controlling benefits, but a perception of improved animal welfare. This observation showed that some farmers were willing to adopt practices without financial gains, if other benefits were perceived. To investigate motivators for implementation, theories from social sciences, behavioural economics and human medicine were combined with the knowledge of livestock farming. This generated a theoretical conceptual framework: a “pathway to disease control”-model, which was validated using field data. The “pathway to disease control”-model was used to identify and explain motivational factors for implementation of zoonotic control on English and Welsh cattle farms. In general, attitudes towards zoonotic control were positive, but intent to control was inhibited in approximately half the farmers by non-supportive social norms and/or a lack of belief in self-efficacy. The remaining farmers showed a gradual intent to control, but had not implemented any structured control program due to external barriers including lack of knowledge and cultural and economic pressure from both society and industry. The farmers with no intent to adopt control measures identified their private veterinarian as the preferred motivator, whereas consumer-demand and financial rewards or penalties were significantly more likely to be preferred by farmers who intended to control.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Meta-analysis is a statistical method to summarize research data from multiple studies in a quantitative manner. This dissertation addresses a number of methodological topics in causal meta-analysis and reports the development and validation of meta-analysis software. In the first (methodological) part, we explore how experienced or inexperienced authors of meta-analyses are and show that they are generally not as experienced as one might expect. Next, we discuss the terminology related to biases that occur due to selective dissemination of evidence. In the proposed epistemological framework, publication bias is a pars pro toto and dissemination bias is a more appropriate term to describe the full spectrum of biases. The chapter on the usefulness of graphical assessments shows that forest plots and residual histograms may be best suited to the exploration of heterogeneity in meta-analysis data sets. None of the plots detected (dissemination) selectivity adequately, including the frequently used funnel plots. The last two chapters of the methodology part introduce software (MIX) for causal meta-analysis and report its development and validation, and a comparison with existing meta-analysis software. The applications part contains two meta-analyses in which the previously discussed methods are applied and the MIX software is used. The first meta-analysis re-analyzes data from a recent, widely publicized meta-analysis of 42 clinical trials which concluded that rosiglitazone was associated with an approximately 43% increased risk for myocardial infarction and an approximately 64% increased risk for cardiovascular death. We show that alternative meta-analytic approaches consistently yield results that are not statistically significant and conclude that the risk for myocardial infarction and death from cardiovascular disease for diabetic patients taking rosiglitazone is uncertain: neither increased nor decreased risk is established. The other meta-analysis explores the effects of neuromuscular electrical stimulation on muscle strength, showing that active exercises are preferred over electrical stimulation but that electrical stimulation can have an added benefit in immobilized patients. The dissertation concludes with a practical methodological paper on modern methods of causal meta-analysis, providing a step-by-step guide on how to apply a wide range of meta-analytical methods to causal research data. It describes how a meta-analysis preferably starts with a data exploration, which is then followed by a synthesis and an evaluation of the applied meta-analytical methods.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['During the past two decades, capillary electrophoresis–mass spectrometry (CE–MS) has emerged as a powerful analytical tool that is well suited to the analysis of pharmaceutical samples. CE–MS combines efficient and fast separation with mass-selective detection and can be considered as orthogonal to LC–MS. Until now, the coupling of CE with MS has predominantly been performed through electrospay ionization (ESI). However, conventional CE background electrolytes (BGEs) like phosphate and borate buffers may cause ion suppression in ESI, and thus lead to reduced or even complete loss of analyte signals. This especially hinders the application of special CE-modes such as micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC) in which (nonvolatile) surfactants are added to enhance selectivity and/or to achieve separation of neutral compounds. In addition, ESI is less suited to analytes that are not readily ionized in solution. In this thesis, the design and performance of CE–MS systems based on alternative ionization techniques, viz. atmospheric pressure photoionization (APPI), atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) and theromospray ionization (TS), has been investigated. In both APCI and APPI, the sample is first vaporized after which ionization is initiated by a corona discharge or VUV irradiation, respectively. Under specific conditions, polar compounds could be detected in the absence of corona discharge or VUV-photons. In this case, ion formation largely appeared to occur through TS. APPI and APCI were both found suitable for ionization of neutral compounds that were poorly detected by electrospray ionization. APPI enabled the formation of odd-electron ions, and therefore provided a means to detect apolar compounds upon separation by MEKC. The gas-phase-ion formation of ionic species, such as quaternary ammonium compounds, does not rely on charge-exchange or proton-transfer and can therefore not be analysed by APCI-MS or APPI-MS. Instead, this type of compounds may be analysed by TS-MS, which can be carried out using either an APPI or APCI source. Furthermore, under specific conditions, APPI and TS can be employed simultaneously, which ensures the applicability of CE–APPI-MS for a wide variety of compounds ranging from ionic to apolar. With ESI and TS analyte signals were significantly suppressed in the presence of nonvolatile buffers or surfactants. By contrast, APCI and APPI showed a strong compatibility with these constituents. With all CE–MS systems, impurities in drugs down to 0.1% (w/w) could be detected and identified. Overall, ESI and TS appeared the most efficient ionization techniques, especially for impurities that are charged in solution, resulting in detection limits down to 100 ng/mL in the full-scan mode. The signal response for APCI and APPI was often lower than for ESI, but still enabled detection at the 0.1% level by injection of 1 mg/mL of the parent compound. These results show that APPI, APCI and TS are suitable ionization techniques for drug impurity profiling by CE–MS. The availability of alternative ionization methods for CE–MS enhances the compatibility of this technique with nonvolatile buffers and surfactants, and allows a larger number of impurities in drugs to be detected.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Role of nuclear receptors in adverse anticancer drug reactions? Unwanted drug-drug interactions and the development of multidrug resistance are ongoing concerns in the treatment of cancer patients. A common factor that is shared by both phenomena is enzyme induction. Especially, the induction of enzymes involved in the metabolism and disposition of anticancer drugs can pose a major health risk. Since anticancer drugs have a very narrow therapeutic window, small alterations in the pharmacokinetic profile of these agents can have far reaching clinical consequences. Indeed, several well-known enzyme inducers such as the antibiotic rifampicin, the anticonvulsants phenobarbital and phenytoin, and the over-the-counter herbal antidepressant St.John’swort, have been shown to cause intoxications or loss of therapeutic efficacy when combined with anticancer drugs. These drugs were shown to mediate enzyme induction by activating the pregnane X receptor (PXR): a very promiscuous nuclear receptor involved in the regulation of cytochrome P450 3A4 and P-glycoprotein. Interestingly, we show that established anticancer drugs such as paclitaxel, tamoxifen, oxazophosphorines, but also the novel and very promising tyrosine kinase inhibitors erlotinib, gefitinib and nilotinib are activators of PXR as well. Upon activation by these anticancer drugs, PXR mediates the induction of CYP3A4 and Pgp and enhances the biotransformation of CYP3A4 substrates. Additionally, reduced cellular accumulation of Pgp substrates was observed. These results indicate that PXR plays an important role in pharmacokinetic (anticancer) drug-anticancer drug interactions. Furthermore, since induction of drug transporters, and to a lesser extent induction of drug metabolizing enzymes, is one of the main mechanisms by which cancer cells acquire resistance against multiple agents, the role of PXR activation in multidrug resistance was evaluated. Activation of PXR, and subsequent Pgp induction by tumor cells, results in reduced cellular accumulation of anticancer agents and renders these tumor cells resistant to anticancer drugs. Together, these results show that PXR is an important mediator of unwanted drug-drug interactions and plays a role in the development of multidrug resistance.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Premature ovarian failure : from phenotype to genotype'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Postponement of childbearing has led to increased rates of age-related female subfertility. Age-related decreases in ovarian follicle numbers and decay in oocyte quality influence the natural loss of fecundity and ultimately the start of menopause. The rate of ovarian ageing is highly variable among women, so it is relevant to be able to identify women who have severely decreased ovarian reserve for their age. Spontaneous Premature Ovarian Failure (POF) is the most extreme phenotype of ovarian failure at a young age. POF is characterized by spontaneous secondary amenorrhea before the age of 40. POF not only truncates the fertile lifespan, but also has major implications for long-term health (i.e. osteoporosis, cardiovascular health and cognition). The aetiology of the great majority of spontaneous POF cases remains unknown. Since family history has been shown to be the best predictor for early menopause and strong associations have been disclosed between the menopausal ages of mothers and daughters, sisters and twin pairs, idiopathic POF is most likely due to genetic factors. The aim of this thesis was to further elucidate the phenotype of premature ovarian failure and to explore the genetic mechanisms underlying this phenotype. Classically, ovarian dysfunction is categorized on the basis of cycle history and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Our study indicated that anti-Mllerian hormone, a novel ovarian marker, may provide a more accurate assessment of the follicle pool in young hypergonadotropic patients, especially in the clinically challenging subgroups of patients with elevated FSH and regular menses or with cycle disturbances but not fulfilling the POF diagnostic criteria. Early menopause is associated with a higher incidence of cardiovascular events later in life. Concurrent with the menopausal transition, there is a shift in lipid profile. POF provides a route to studying the effect of cessation of ovarian function on lipid profile independent of the effects of advanced chronological age. We found that loss of ovarian function at a very young age (POF) coincides with subtle changes in lipid profile (higher triglyceride levels, marginal lower HDL-cholesterol). Androgens are better markers for unfavourable lipid changes than oestrogen levels or duration of oestrogen deprivation. A genome wide association study was initiated to identify new genetic variants involved in POF. We did observe a possible association with a single nucleotide polymorphism in ADAMTS19, a biologically plausible candidate gene. This finding warrants a larger follow-up study to investigate its role in POF. Besides SNPs, the human genome contains multiple copy number variants (CNVs), small, sub-microscopic deletions and duplications. POF is associated with macroscopic deletions, in particular on the Xq arm. Using the intensities of high-density, genome-wide oligonucleotide arrays, it is now possible to obtain an increase in resolution of more than 100 times compared to conventional karyograms, and it is thus possible to detect CNVs. Sixty-three percent of the long arm CNVs (90% deletion) mapped to locus Xq21. Our findings are preliminary although the abundant overrepresentation of CNVs on Xq21 further substantiates the important role of this locus in the genetics of POF.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['This thesis is focused on improvement of blood vessel disruption. New systems have been developed that effectuate tumor blood vessel disruption at the molecular, colloidal and cellular level. Vascular disrupting agents (VDAs) are generally small molecular weight drugs that bind to cytoskeletal alfa-tubulin and thereby temporary inhibit or destabilize microtubule formation. Interruption of tubulin polymerization can initiate arrest of cell dynamics, cell shape change and ultimately leads to apoptosis. These changes induce thrombus formation and consequent blood vessel congestion, leading to local oxygen and nutrient deprivation and cell death. A large quantity of tumor tissue could be killed by VDAs, however, always a typical viable rim remains at the tumor periphery inducing rapid repopulation and tumor progression. In the molecular approach, we synthesized PEGylated prodrug derivatives of colchicine, the parent VDA. In chapter 2 the synthesis, in vitro efficacy and the in vivo behaviour of the PEGylated prodrugs is discussed. Two biodegradable prodrugs were designed (one degrading fast, the other slow) and characterized to enhance vascular disruption in tumors and to reduce systemic adverse effects normally seen for colchicine. Although both in vitro and in vivo results were promising further research is needed to optimize the prodrugs. The second vascular disruption system we investigated is colloidal delivery of VDAs or combination of VDAs with colloidal therapeutics. In chapter 3, a small molecular VDA developed by AstraZeneca, called ZD6126, was encapsulated into (targeted) liposomes. Single and multiple doses of both liposomal ZD6126 formulations showed significant prolonged therapeutic efficacy for established tumors when compared to the same dose of free ZD6126. Endothelial targeting proved not to be beneficial and unfortunately, multiple 100 mg/kg liposomal injections appeared toxic. In chapter 4, a combination therapy strategy was tested to attack tumor core and tumor periphery simultaneously. Free ZD6126 was exploited to kill the tumor core and additionally radionuclide 177Lu decorated (targeted) liposomes were designed to attack the remaining tumor rim. No additional or synergistic efficacy compared to single agent therapy was seen. Moreover, massive liver and spleen accumulation was seen and 177Lu-liposome doses of 20 MBq appeared to be very toxic. The combination therapy strategy using radionuclides in combination with VDAs is promising but further optimalization and fine-tuning is crucial. The third way we explored to target the tumor vasculature and consequently induce disruption is by specific targeting of (red blood) cells. In chapter 5, we describe tumor targeting by erythrocytes modified with RGD-peptides. RGD-modified erythrocytes furthermore represent a model for opsonized apoptotic and/or aged erythrocytes. Angiogenic endothelial cells, incubated with apoptotic cell opsonin (lactadherin) bound particles, apoptotic cells and RGD-modified erythrocytes, showed massive binding and consequent internalization. Injection of RGD-modified erythrocytes into tumor-bearing mice, showed tumor endothelial cell phagocytosis, damage and ultimately massive cell death. Further optimization of the model, was described and discussed in chapter 6. We treated the RGD-modified erythrocytes by glutaraldehyde to make the erythrocytes more rigid, a feature of erythrocytes in apoptosis. Incubation with HUVECs showed a significant increase in association compared to RGD-modified erythrocytes without glutaraldehyde treatment.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Various microorganisms are able to infect endothelial cells, hepatocytes, adipocytes and monocytes. Intracellular infection of these cells in vitro induces cellular dysfunction and initiates procoagulant activity, hypofibrinolysis, impaired cellular function, and inflammation, as reflected by increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. There was a remarkable resemblance in how monocytes, hepatocytes, endothelial cells, and adipocytes reacted to infection, with the activation of processes that could be involved in atherogenesis. This suggests that not only direct infection of the vessel wall but also indirect infection by transmission of viruses to tissues elsewhere in the body may initiate a systemic inflammatory and procoagulant state. The results of the studies presented in this thesis suggest that intracellular infections have a causal role in the etiology of vascular diseases. We propose that intracellular microorganisms should be added to the list of factors that induce endothelial dysfunction and contribute to the development of atherosclerosis. We identified inflammation, procoagulant activity, and hypofibrinolysis to be major outcomes of intracellular infection of different types of cells. Our studies identified at least some of the mechanisms by which intracellular infections may contribute to the development of cardiovascular diseases. Chronic low-grade inflammation is a component of many diseases and is often seen in atherosclerosis, obesity, diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. The presence of inflammation is evidenced by elevated plasma concentrations of a variety of markers. Atherosclerosis begins in early life and progresses to cause severe adverse effects in adult life. This is a chronic multifactorial process and cannot be explained solely in terms of the traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Infections with a variety of microorganisms during lifetime are common and could be a direct cause of atherosclerosis. Infective progeny virus may invade cells involved in atherogenesis and disseminate to other cells. Intracellular infections in vivo may become latent or even persistent, but may still be capable of having a deleterious effect on cells. The cumulative effects of simultaneous infections at various sites and/or repetitive infections may contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of atherosclerosis. Influenza virus, Cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Chlamydia pneumoniae (Cp), in particular, have been associated with cardiovascular disorders. The role of infections in endothelial injury and vascular wall inflammation has been studied extensively but current data do not allow us to determine whether infection is a cause or a co-factor in atherogenesis. Animal and pathological studies probably provide the best evidence that infections have effects in vivo similar to those seen in atherosclerosis. In the in vitro studies presented in this thesis, we investigated which of the effects caused by these infections could account for the impairment of vascular function and atherogenesis. We infected endothelial cells, hepatocytes, adipocytes and monocytes and measured inflammatory parameters (IL-6, TNF-alpha) and fibrinolytic parameters (PAI-1) and coagulation factors in the infected culture supernatants. Infection consistently resulted in time and dose dependent inflammatory effects. In conclusion, we showed that various infections are able to trigger cellular responses involved in atherogenesis. We therefore propose a causal role for intracellular pathogens in the etiology of vascular diseases.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Neonatal infections are an important cause of morbidity in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). Prematurity or very low birth weight is an important predisposing factor for neonatal infection. In addition, preterm infants have a compromized immune system and they often require invasive procedures that provide a portal of entry. The epidemiology of sepsis since 1978 on our NICU showed a decrease in incidence of early-onset sepsis. Group B streptococci and, less frequent, Escherichia coli were the most important microorganisms during the years, causing early-onset sepsis. The incidence of late-onset sepsis caused by Coagulase Negative Staphylococci (CoNS) and S. aureus increased significantly over the years. The increase of the use of central venous and arterial catheters probably contributed to the increase in infections in neonates. In contrary to studies in the USA, infections due to gram-negative microorganisms and fungi or yeasts were rare on our unit (incidence <0.3%). The use of antibiotics is high on the NICU. We showed that 85 - 90% of all admitted infants was treated with antibiotics, whereas the incidence of proven early-, and late-onset sepsis was much lower (range 1.2-2.4% and 7.1-14%, respectively). However, a significant decrease in length of antibiotic treatment was noted over the period for the most frequently used antibiotics. The results of this study emphasize that correct identification of infants with sepsis is difficult and remains a major challenge in attempts to further reduce antibiotic use and postpone the emergence of antibiotic resistant microorganisms. Prevention of neonatal sepsis is a major challenge. The use of in-line filters in the intravenous administration (IV) sets in neonates was randomly studied. This study showed that in-line filters did not result in a significant decrease in nosocomial sepsis. However, a more continuous administration of intravenous medication (especially cardio-inotropics) and parenteral nutrition was guaranteed, while there was no difference in costs of materials. For the purpose of patient safety the use of in-line filters in all IV administration systems may be recommended in neonatal intensive care units. In a retrospective and a prospective study on percutaneously inserted central venous catheter (PCVC) -removal and its relationship with sepsis, we showed that besides indwelling PCVC as a risk factor for late-onset sepsis also removal of a PCVC is a risk factor. Administration of antibiotics targeted at the time of removal of the catheter significantly reduced the incidence of sepsis. Very important in the prevention of late-onset sepsis in neonates is the adherence to hygienic rules. In varies studies it is shown that it is very difficult for medical and nursing healthcare workers to adhere to hygienic rules and hand hygiene. Multimodal intervention programs have been proven to be effective in the adherence to hygienic rules. Our multimodal intervention program resulted in a significant increase in adherence to hygienic rules, from 23% to 50%. However, a result of 50% adherence is still too low and requires further improvement.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Knowledge of the transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus still has gaps, complicating epidemic control. A model was developed to back-calculate the day HPAI virus was introduced into a flock, based on within-flock mortality data of the Dutch HPAI H7N7 epidemic (2003). The method was based on a stochastic epidemic model in which birds move from being susceptible, latently infected and infectious, to death. Our results indicated that two weeks can elapse before a noticeable increase in mortality is observed after a single introduction into a flock. Furthermore, field data were used to estimate the transmission rate parameter beta and the influence of risk factors on within-flock transmission. Daily mortality data again were back-calculated to fit a susceptible – infectious – dead format. The method took into account the uncertainty of the length of the latent period, the survival of an infection by some birds and the influence of farm characteristics. The beta was estimated at 4.50 per chicken per day (95% CI: 2.68 – 7.57) with a bird-infectious period of four days. In contrast to general belief, none of the studied risk factors (housing system, flock size, species, age of the birds and date of depopulation) had significant influence on the estimated beta. The same method was used on field data of the HPAI H7N1 epidemic in Italy in 1999-2000. The bird-infectious period was assumed to be two days, and all birds were assumed to die after this infectious period. The estimated beta for HPAI H7N1 virus transmission in turkeys was 1.43 (95% CI: 1.17 – 1.74). Farm risk factors such as flock size and age of the turkeys again did not influence beta. The effect of vaccination on HPAI H7N7 transmission in turkeys was estimated by means of a transmission experiment. Cloacal and tracheal swabs (for real-time RT-PCR) and serum samples (for hemagglutination inhibition test) were taken to monitor the infection both in inoculated and in susceptible contact turkeys, which were all either unvaccinated, vaccinated once or vaccinated twice with H7N1. Unvaccinated contact birds had a mean infectious period of 6.2 days, and an estimated beta of 1.26 per infectious bird per day. However, no virus shedding was found in inoculated vaccinated turkeys and thus we concluded that vaccination with H7N1 protected against challenge with HPAI H7N7 virus. During the Dutch epidemic a large number of human infections were reported. We estimated infection probabilities for persons involved in disease control on infected farms. Case definition was based on self-reported conjunctivitis and positive hemagglutination inhibition test. A high infection probability during a farm-visit was associated with clinical inspection of poultry in the area surrounding infected flocks (7.6%, 95% CI: 1.4 – 18.9%) and active culling during depopulation (6.2%, 95% CI: 3.7 – 9.6%). Low probabilities were estimated for managing biosecurity (0.0%, 95% CI: 0.0 – 1.0%) and cleaning assistance during depopulation (0.0%, 95% CI: 0.0 – 9.2%). No significant association was observed between the probability of infection and some exposure variables (number of birds present, housing type, poultry type, depopulation method, period during epidemic).'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['In the last decades many different policy changes have been initiated in the Dutch hospital sector to optimise health care delivery: national agenda-setting, increased competition and transparency, a new system of hospital reimbursement based on diagnosis-treatment-combinations, intensified monitoring of quality, and a multi-layered organisational development programme based on quality improvement collaboratives – the multi-level quality collaborative (MQC). The focus of this dissertation is on the implementation and effects of the MQC. Several studies are described that help to answer two main research questions: (1) Did the participation by hospitals in the MQC result in the development of an organisational infrastructure for improvement, stimulating the adoption and sustainable spread of innovations and, if so, by what mechanism? (2) Is there, judged from changes that took place at different levels within the hospitals, any evidence that the MQC contributed to aligning the behaviour of staff at unit level with norms at national level via the behaviour of the strategic management? With regard to the first question, it is probable that the programme has contributed to quality improvement. Hundreds of improvement projects have been implemented within the MQC hospitals. Individual projects have shown positive results, but the performance indicator outcomes or perceived effects of a substantial part of the teams are unknown. Furthermore, different studies point at an organisational development effect. The strategic and tactical hospital management followed a systematic strategy on behalf of sustainability and spread; a strategy based on clear norms at organisation level, performance agreements, provision of necessary facilities and resources, and recurring accountability moments. The organisational infrastructure is adjusted to facilitate the implementation of the strategy. A longitudinal analysis suggests that programme hospitals evolved faster than the other hospitals. Three assumptions were explored to answer the second question: (a) competition and public communication of feasible quality norms, trigger hospitals to maximise quality (sector level), (b) MQC participation leads to systematic quality control (hospital level), (3) medical staff implements changes to achieve quality norms defined at higher levels (unit level). This dissertation demonstrates that planned change processes at different levels took place and were interrelated. Professionals adopted quality norms, took measures to realise the goals and measured performance-indicators. Improvement rates were confirmed as predictors for the future dissemination of the projects. This is an example of the continuous quality improvement that is being embedded at institutional level throughout the sector, not only within MQC-hospitals. During the programme, moreover, the behaviour of hospital executives did influence the extent to which the behaviour of project teams and physicians at unit level was aimed at achieving the MQC norms formulated at sector level. The MQC encouraged executives to do this in two ways. In the first place by adopting the organisational strategy for sustainability and dissemination. Secondly, by stimulating physicians to join quality improvement initiatives. As such, the MQC has contributed to a mechanism, linking quality targets at sector level to processes and outcomes at unit level.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with slowly progressive changes in the brain, a complication referred to as diabetic encephalopathy. Previous studies have shown that patients with T2DM show mild to moderate decrements in cognitive functioning and an increased risk of dementia. The central topic of the studies in this thesis was to examine at which stage of the diabetes these cognitive decrements start to develop and how they progress over time. In addition, the role of exposure to vascular risk factors in the relation between T2DM and cognition was examined in detail. A systematic review of the literature on the impact of T2DM, hypertension, obesity and dyslipidemia on cognitive functioning and the risk of dementia showed that these risk factors are associated with mild cognitive decrements, mainly in memory, cognitive speed and mental flexibility (effect size -0.3). Also, a 1.5 to 2-fold increased risk of dementia is consistently reported in relation to these vascular risk factors. The progression from normal glucose tolerance to definite T2DM is gradual process. Cognitive decrements may already start to develop in the early stages of the disease, even before the actual onset of hyperglycemia. Cognitive functioning was therefore compared between 64 patients with recent onset T2DM, 83 persons with the metabolic syndrome (= a ‘pre-diabetes’ group that included persons who had vascular risk factor profile similar to the T2DM group, but no diabetes) and 100 control participants. Both patient groups showed worse cognitive performance compared to the controls, but there was no difference in performance between persons with T2DM or metabolic syndrome. The next part of the thesis addressed the progression of cognitive decrements in persons with known T2DM. A detailed neuropsychological examination in 122 elderly patients with T2DM revealed mild cognitive impairments in memory, information-processing speed and mental flexibility compared to 56 control participants. These patients also had more vascular and degenerative abnormalities on brain MRI. Re-examination of the sample after 4 years, however, revealed no accelerated decline in cognition for persons with T2DM. In the final part of the thesis the relation between T2DM, metabolic syndrome and cognition was examined in a population of 599 85- to 90-year-old persons. T2DM was associated with cognitive decrements, but persons with the metabolic syndrome showed a decelerated cognitive decline during follow-up. In conclusion, the studies presented in this thesis indicate that diabetes-associated cognitive decrements are the result of an insidious process, starting years before the onset of T2DM. It involves prolonged exposure to vascular risk factors, such as hypertension and obesity, and may change over time as a consequence of both exposure time and the changes in the level of these risk factors that occur with increasing age. The neuropsychological profile appears to reflect an overall diminished performance level rather than deficits in specific cognitive functions. The challenge for future studies is to find out how these cognitive decrements are best dealt with in daily clinical care and to try and identify those patients who are particularly at risk of serious cognitive decline and dementia.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Nucleoside analogs are an important class of drugs in anticancer and antiviral therapy. The compounds are, however, only active after intracellular conversion to their mono-, di- and triphosphate nucleotide form. In this thesis the development of sensitive liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assays to quantitate nucleoside and nucleotide analogs in cells is described. These assays were then applied to preclinical and clinical studies. Synthesis of nucleotide analogs In chapter 1 the synthesis of small amounts of nucleotide analogs from nucleoside analogs is described. These nucleotide analogs were required as reference and internal standards in quantitative analytical assays. Bioanalysis of intracellular nucleoside and nucleotide analogs First, a literature overview of liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry (LC-MS) methods for the quantitative determination of nucleotide analogs in cells is given (chapter 2.1). The development and validation of an assay for cladribine nucleotides is described in chapter 2.2. The nucleotides were quantified in cells and growth medium. In chapter 2.3, a similar assay was developed and validated for the 6 nucleotide forms of emtricitabine and tenofovir. The method was applied to samples from a patient. The development of a novel chromatographic system for the separation of nucleosides and nucleotides using porous graphitic carbon without ion-pairing agents is outlined in chapter 2.4. In chapter 2.5 this method was applied to biological matrices. We were able to separate the nucleoside and nucleotide forms of the anticancer agent gemcitabine and of its deaminated metabolite (2’,2’-difluorodeoxyuridine; dFdU). The method was validated for the simultaneous quantification of these 8 analytes in white blood cells. Chapter 2.6 compares two common methods for the quantification of the number of white blood cells in a sample. A DNA-based quantitation method was found to be superior over a protein-based method because it was unaffected by red blood cell contamination. This DNA-base method was finally validated. Pharmacology of nucleoside analogs In chapter 3.1 the role of the drug-efflux pump breast cancer related protein (BCRP) in resistance against anti-cancer nucleoside analogs was investigated. It was found that cells that overexpressed this drug-efflux pump were less sensitive to nucleoside analogs. We concluded that BCRP extruded both cladribine and its monophospate from cells. Chapter 3.2 describes a clinical study in which low doses of gemcitabine were orally administered to patients. The exposure to gemcitabine and its triphosphate was very low due extensive first-pass metabolism. A lethal hepatic toxicity observed was possibly related to accumulation of the triphosphate of deaminated gemcitabine, a previously unrecognized metabolite. Chapter 3.3 provides a literature overview on the formation and pharmacological activity of deoxyuridine analog nucleotides during deoxycytidine analog therapy. It is concluded that many deoxycytidine analogs are converted to deoxyuridine nucleotides in cells and that these nucleotides possess pharmacological activity. In chapter 3.4 the nucleotides of decitabine were determined in white blood cells from 3 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome. The decitabine triphosphate levels corresponded to the clinical effect. Accumulation of decitabine triphospate during treatment indicated that a less intensive dosing scheme without hospitalization could be as effective as the current dosing scheme.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Increasingly sensitive analytical tools allow measurement of trace concentrations of chemicals in human biologic media in persons from the general population. Such data are being generated by biomonitoring programs conducted by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the European Union, Canada and other regional and national governments and other researchers. However, few screening tools are available for interpretation of such data in a health risk assessment context. This dissertation describes the concept and implementation of Biomonitoring Equivalents (BEs), estimates of the concentration of a chemical or metabolite in a biological medium that is consistent with an existing exposure guidance value such as a tolerable daily intake (TDI) or reference dose (RfD). The BE approach integrates available pharmacokinetic data to convert an existing exposure guidance value into an equivalent concentration in a biological medium. Key concepts regarding the derivation and communication of BE values resulting from an expert workshop held in 2007 are summarized. BE derivations for a series of compounds are presented: toluene, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), cadmium, acrylamide, trihalomethanes (chloroform, bromoform, chlorodibromomethane, dichlorobromomethane), and cyfluthrin. The interpretation of biomonitoring data for 2,4-D and the trihalomethanes using the BE values are presented. These case studies demonstrate that a range of pharmacokinetic data and approaches can be used to derive BE values; fully-developed physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models, while useful, are not required. Often, data from simple controlled dosing studies in humans prove the most useful for derivation of BEs. Comparing biomonitoring data with the BE provides the risk manager a means of assessing the priority for risk assessment follow-up required for a chemical. The communication model for interpreting biomonitoring data in the context of the BE relies on classifying compounds in relative priority for risk assessment follow-up, where risk assessment follow-up may include; exposure assessment evaluations, re-evaluating the underlying risk assessments, and risk management or product stewardship actions. Biomonitoring data for some compounds may be orders of magnitude below the BEs, while biomonitoring levels for other compounds may approach or exceed the chemical-specific BEs. Using conventional risk assessment approaches, the ratio between the BE and biomonitoring levels can be regarded as a margin of safety. The compounds with the lowest margin of safety would indicate a higher priority for risk management efforts. Comparing biomonitoring results from the CDC to the available BEs indicate a relative margins of safety of (from highest to lowest) cyfluthrin, toluene, 2,4-D, trihalomethanes, cadmium and acrylamide. Therefore, prioritization for risk assessment follow-up would be (from lowest priority to highest priority): cyfluthrin, toluene, 2,4-D, cadmium, trihalomethanes and acrylamide. Biomonitoring has been called the ‘gold standard’ of exposure assessment. However, it is only with quantitative tools like the BE, which allow interpretation of biomonitoring data in a risk assessment context, that biomonitoring data can be fully appreciated and then become the ‘gold standard’ of exposure assessment and an important tool in human health risk assessment.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Low volume metastases in breast cancer sentinel nodes: A diagnostic and therapeutic challenge'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['A SN biopsy is an accurate method to assess nodal status in breast cancer patients and has largely replaced the traditional axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) as an initial staging procedure. The clinical scenarios for the use of a SN biopsy are expanding. We reviewed the literature regarding the role of a SN biopsy in patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and following neoadjuvant chemotherapy. We concluded that it could be considered on an individual basis, but we think there is insufficient evidence to recommend this as a standard procedure in these patients. Selective targeting of the SN with extensive pathological assessment increased the detection rate of small metastases with unknown clinical significance. This phenomenon is reflected by the International Union Against Cancer (UICC) system and by the 6th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Cancer Staging Manual, which defined metastases in three categories based on size: isolated tumor cells (ITC) (?0.2 mm), micrometastases (> 0.2- ? 2 mm) and macrometastases (> 2 mm). Although patients with ITC are staged as N0, there is no generally accepted approach regarding local control in this group. The published literature reported an overall pooled risk of higher echelon lymph node involvement (further denoted as non-SNs) of 12.3% after finding ITC in the SN. Because the majority of patients with SN ITC had non-SN macrometastases, there might be an indication for an ALND for those patients with SN ITC without other indications for adjuvant systemic therapy. A substantial proportion of patients with SN involvement do not have non-SN involvement. We assessed the predictive value of the SN tumor load (defined as the area% of the SN involved by tumor) and its micro-anatomic location, for non-SN involvement. Based on these features however, we could not select a subgroup of patients without non-SN involvement. Previous studies suggested that small epithelial deposits in lymph nodes may represent mechanically displaced benign or malignant epithelial cells, rather than true metastases. We therefore assessed the malignant potential of ITC by nuclear morphometry and immunohistochemistry. The results of these analyses suggest that some of these deposits represent benign or degenerated malignant epithelium lacking outgrowth potential. Since the distinction between ITC, micro-and macrometastases directly affects therapeutic decisions making, it is important to have a reproducible pathological staging method that provides a prognostic separation. We compared some refinements of the current definitions and offer suggestions regarding its use in lobular breast carcinoma patients. The unknown prognostic relevance of micrometastases and ITC leads to different opinions regarding adjuvant therapy. We evaluated the prognostic relevance of these metastases and the impact of adjuvant systemic therapy in a large nationwide Dutch cohort study and demonstrated a negative prognostic impact of both ITC and micrometastases in early stage breast cancer patients not receiving adjuvant systemic therapy. Furthermore, disease recurrence was reduced in patients treated with adjuvant systemic therapy. Of particular interest was that the impact of ITC was similar to the impact or micrometastases.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and malaria are two diseases of distinct origin. TTP is a rare disorder caused by a deficiency of the von Willebrand factor (VWF) cleaving protease ADAMTS13. Malaria is a poverty-related disease caused by protozoan parasites from the genus Plasmodium. TTP and malaria share several clinical symptoms including intravascular platelet agglutination with thrombocytopenia, haemolytic anemia, neurological symptoms and fever. VWF plays an essential role in the adhesion of platelets to the injured vessel wall under conditions of blood flow. The platelet-binding site of plasma VWF, which is located in the A1 domain, is encrypted to prevent unwanted interaction with platelets. In order to arrest bleeding, VWF is converted from its latent conformation into an active conformation, a conformation in which the platelet-binding site in the A1 domain is exposed. Persistence of active VWF in the circulation would cause undesired VWF-platelet aggregate formation, resulting in thrombosis and/or bleeding from thrombocytopenia. Therefore, tight regulation of VWF activation and inactivation mechanisms is essential to prevent the occurrence of both bleeding and thrombotic events. An important regulator of VWF activity is ADAMTS13, a metalloprotease that cleaves VWF. TTP is caused by a genetic or auto-immune based deficiency or dysfunction of ADAMTS13. Aberrations in VWF have been described for both TTP and malaria. In acute TTP, when patients suffer from thrombosis and require plasma exchange, absence of ADAMTS13 results in the presence of active VWF multimers in the circulation. Consequently, microthrombi are being formed that cause occlusion of the microvasculature and organ damage. With respect to remission, when patients do not longer require plasma exchange to prevent thrombosis, no information is available about active VWF. For malaria, elevated VWF-antigen levels have been reported in field studies, but the eventual role of active VWF in the development of platelet-clumping and thrombocytopenia is unknown. This thesis aims to provide more insight into the origin of active VWF and the role of active VWF in TTP and malaria. Chapter 3 focuses on endothelial cells and reports studies on the origin of active VWF. Chapter 4 describes VWF- and ADAMTS13-related features in a cohort of TTP patients in remission and gives insight in the composition of active VWF multimers. Chapter 5 addresses the relevance of an ADAMTS13 activity assay, based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer, with regard to TTP diagnosis. Chapters 6 and 7 describe the relation between (active) VWF, ADAMTS13 and thrombocytopenia in an experimental human infection malaria study involving healthy volunteers (chapter 6) and in a field study on the Indonesian island Sumba (chapter 7). In the last chapter (chapter 8), the findings from the preceding chapters are taken together and discussed.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Drug targeting to tumors using HPMA copolymers'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Copolymers based on N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (HPMA) are prototypic and well-characterized polymeric drug carriers that have been broadly implemented in the delivery of anticancer agents. HPMA copolymers circulate for prolonged periods of time, and by means of the Enhance Permeability and Retention (EPR) effect, they localize to tumors both effectively and selectively. As a consequence, the concentrations of attached active agents in tumors can be increased, and their accumulation in healthy organs and tissues can be attenuated, together resulting in a substantial improvement in the balance between the efficacy and the toxicity of chemotherapy. Taking these notions into account, the aim of the present thesis was to investigate, understand, improve and extend drug targeting to tumors using HPMA copolymers. To provide a proper theoretical framework for investigating drug targeting to tumors using HPMA copolymers, in Chapter 2, the basic principles of passive and active drug targeting are summarized, and several clinically relevant examples of tumor-targeted nanomedicines are highlighted. To better understand drug targeting to tumors, in Chapter 3, the circulation kinetics, the biodistribution and the tumor accumulation of thirteen physicochemically different HPMA copolymers are evaluated. In Chapter 4, based on the notion that HPMA copolymers circulate for prolonged periods of time, a gadolinium-containing contrast agent is developed for MR angiography, i.e. for imaging blood vessels. In Chapter 5, to provide some initial indications in favor of the combination of polymeric nanomedicines with surgery, the impact of intratumoral injection on the biodistribution and the therapeutic potential of HPMA copolymer-based drug delivery systems is investigated. To actively improve passive drug targeting, in Chapter 6, the effects of different doses of radiotherapy and hyperthermia on the tumor accumulation of HPMA copolymers are evaluated. In Chapter 7, drug targeting to tumors using HPMA copolymers is extended, showing both for doxorubicin and for gemcitabine that long-circulating and passively tumor-targeted polymeric drug carriers are able to improve the efficacy of (clinically relevant regimens of) radiochemotherapy. In Chapter 8, using an HPMA copolymer co-functionalized both with doxorubicin and with gemcitabine, evidence is provided showing that polymers, as e.g. liposomes, can be used to deliver two different drugs to tumors simultaneously, and to improve the efficacy of chemotherapy combinations. And finally, in Chapter 9, the insights provided and the evidence obtained are summarized and discussed, and several general conclusions are drawn. Together, the work described in this thesis demonstrates that HPMA copolymers are suitable systems for passive drug targeting to tumors, and that long-circulating and passively tumor-targeted polymeric nanomedicines are suitable systems for improving the efficacy of combined modality anticancer therapy.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Several important issues such as atrial fibrillation and CRT, response of elderly patients to CRT and the aspects of upgrading conventional pacemakers to biventricular devices are addressed. The peak endocardial acceleration (PEA) concept and PEAarea method are explained. Finally, the role of pressure-volume loop analysis in CRT is discussed. Chapter 2 We studied 130 patients with a biventricular pacemaker and advanced heart failure. Echocardiographic response (LVEF improvement ? 5 %) was documented in 69%, 88% and 91% of the survivors, after 3 months, 1 year and 2 years, respectively. Echocardiographic response after 3 months was associated with a significantly higher long-term survival. Chapter 3. CRT was performed in 96 patients with chronic AF and 167 patients with sinus rhythm. NYHA class, 6-minute walking distance, quality of life score, LV ejection fraction and mitral regurgitation improved significantly at 3 and 12 months in both groups. Reverse LV remodeling after 12 months was 82% in the AF group versus 83% in the sinus rhythm group. Chapter 4 The clinical and echocardiographic response to CRT in elderly (age >75 years) patients was compared to a group of younger patients (age ?75 years). Follow-up showed in both groups a comparable and sustained improvement in NYHA class, quality of life, LV ejection fraction and heart failure hospitalization. Analysis of 39 octogenarians showed also significant clinical and echocardiographic improvement. Chapter 5 CRT was performed in 194 symptomatic heart failure patients with a native LBBB and in 90 heart failure patients with a pacing-induced LBBB during chronic apical RV pacing. Although baseline characteristics differed slightly between the 2 groups, during the 2 years of follow-up clinical parameters, echocardiographic improvement, and survival after CRT implant were comparable. Chapter 6 We compared the optimal assessed VV interval measured by means of the PEAarea method to the optimal VV int erval determined by LV dP/dtmax. During CRT implantation in 15 patients, we simultaneously assessed LV dP/dtmax and the area under the PEA curve during AV scanning at different VV intervals. In 9 of the 12 responders, the optimal pacing configuration identified by the PEAarea method was in agreement with the greatest LV dP/dtmax. Chapter 7 The clinical use of pressure-volume loop analyses during CRT implantations was evaluated to assess the optimal lead position in 29 chronically RV-paced patients. Single-side LV pacing and biventricular pacing showed a significant improvement in LV function indices compared to baseline. Substantial inter- and intra-individual differences in LV function between different left-sided pacing sites were seen. In 42% of patients an alternative LV-lead position was chosen by guidance of the highest SW. Chapter 8 Forty heart failure patients with chronic RV apical pacing, decreased LV ejection fraction or dyssynchrony were included. During implantation, at th e optimal LV lead position, SW (37%), LV ejection fraction (16%), cardiac output (29%), and LV dP/dtmax (11%) increased significantly during biventricular pacing compared to baseline. During follow-up, VO2 max, Quality of Life Score, NYHA class and echocardiographic parameters improved significantly during CRT.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['New Biodegradable Peptide-based Polymer Constructs'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Peptide-based polymers are of increasing interest, since they can be applied for a variety of purposes such as drug delivery devices, scaffolds for tissue engineering and -repair, and as novel biomaterials. Peptide-based polymers are common in nature and often exhibit special characteristics. However, when it is very difficult and expensive to harvest peptide-based biopolymers in large quantities from nature, and when it is desired to introduce modifications to modulate their properties, the development of synthetic methods to obtain such peptide-based polymers is necessary. In the ideal situation, the polymerization reaction should be performed with unprotected amino acids or oligopeptides, in high yield and under mild conditions. Until now, no polymerisation method has been found that can meet these requirements. The reaction between acetylenes and organic azides catalyzed by copper (I) yields 1,4-disubstituted 1,2,3-triazoles. The possibility of chemoselective copper(I)-catalyzed alkyne-azide cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction in the presence of other (unprotected) functional groups and the geometrical similarities between peptide amides and 1,2,3-triazoles was the rationale to explore the CuAAC reaction for the synthesis of peptide-based polymers. In this research, terminal acetylene- and azide-substituted model peptides were used. It was found that these peptides could be converted into high molecular weight amino acid-based polymers (up to 45,000 Da) by a microwave-assisted CuAAC reaction. The optimal reaction conditions were used to synthesize peptide-triazole-based polymers that have sites for enzymatic degradation as well as for chemical hydrolysis. It was demonstrated that the synthesized polymers were sensitive to both enzymatic- and chemical hydrolysis. Depending on the reaction conditions, it was found that the outcome of the CuAAC reaction could be directed either to large linear polymers (up to 300 amino acid residues) or toward medium-sized peptide macrocycles (4 to 20 amino acid residues). Such cyclic oligomers were used as building blocks in a self-assembly process to obtain supramolecular polymers. Furthermore, the CuAAC reaction was used to synthesize enzymatically degradable PEG-based hydrogels. It was shown that the rheological properties of the hydrogels could be tailored by varying the reaction conditions and that the hydrogels could be degraded by enzymatic degradation by the protease trypsin. Finally, LCST (lower critical solution temperature) polymers based on the esters of serine and threonine monomers were synthesized by free radical polymerization. LCST polymers are soluble in water below the LCST and become insoluble when the temperature is raised above the LCST. It was proven that the LCST of the polymers could be tailored by varying the ester moiety and/or the amino acid itself. The esters could be degraded by chemical hydrolysis, which resulted in an increase in the LCST of the polymer. By synthesizing a block-copolymer with PEG, thermoresponsive nanoparticles were created. These particles destabilized upon hydrolysis of the ester bonds. The chemically and enzymatically degradable peptide-based polymers, hydrogels and nanoparticles presented in this thesis are interesting candidates for further explorations of the pharmaceutical and biomedical applications.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Sphingolipid topology and membrane protein nanoclusters'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Sphingolipids are an essential class of membrane lipids in eukaryotic cells. Due to their high packing density and their affinity for cholesterol, sphingolipids are able to promote bilayer rigidity and impermeability. Apart from its ability to maintain biomembrane integrity, sphingomyelin (SM) is also a major source for ceramide, involved in signal transduction. Thus, by balancing the formation of ceramide and diacylglycerol (DAG), which is known to act as second messenger, SM synthesis and degradation may play a fundamental role in cell growth and survival. In this thesis, we use C. elegans as an animal model which represents, due to its easy manipulation of gene function by mutation and RNAi, an attractive model to study the implications of SM synthase activity on the molecular level in animal physiology. We identify two proteins of the multigenic protein family as SM synthases and one enzyme as a ceramide phophoethanolamine (CPE) synthase. Glycosphingolipids (GSLs), the other class of membrane sphingolipids, contain polar headgroups which consist of one or more carbohydrate moieties. Here, we discuss the technical issues restraining progress in the elucidation of nanoscale localization of GSLs. Complex GSLs, such as gangliosides, fulfill important roles in recognition and signaling at the plasma membrane and are also used as receptors by parasites, bacteria, viruses and toxins. GM1, a monosialoganglioside, has been shown to be involved in the regulation and activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor, and acts as a receptor for cholera toxin. A defect in the degradation of this interesting lipid leads to its accumulation and storage in the lysosomes, displaying a clinical phenotype, Landing disease or GM1 gangliosidosis. Recently, the accumulation of GM1 was found to activate various channels, and it was suggested that GM1 may accumulate at the ER, eventually leading to a perturbation of calcium homeostasis. In this study we show the localization of accumulated GM1 in diseased cells by immune-electron microscopy after freeze substitution, thereby preventing relocation of lipids during labeling procedures. GM1 was indeed mainly localized to lysosomal/endosomal structures and no evidence for significant increase of GM1 content at other cellular organelles was found. Glycosphingolipids, together with SM and cholesterol are thought to play an essential role in the formation of microdomains, called lipid rafts. The lateral organization of biomembranes was proposed to be required for the sorting of lipids and specialized proteins, and has been shown lately to play a fundamental role in signal transduction. In this present work, we combined for the first time EM and homo-FRET analysis, two techniques that have been successfully used to study nanoscale organization at the plasma membrane. Exploiting the complementary ranges of the two techniques, we were able to study the influence of glycosphingolipids on the distribution of different lipid-anchored proteins on the cytosolic side of the plasma membrane. Glycosphingolipids did not affect the diameter of the protein clusters but increased the number of molecules of the proteins per cluster, while at the same time they lowered the level of molecular interaction between these molecules.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Drug treatment episodes in pharmacoepidemiology - antidepressant use as a model'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['In the Netherlands, antidepressants are indicated for treating depression, generalized anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorders, social phobia, panic disorders, eating disorders, neuropathic pain and nocturnal enuresis. In addition, antidepressants are sometimes used for treating off-label indications such as sleeping disorders, urinary incontinence and headache. The diversity in the nature of these conditions results in a variety of antidepressant treatment patterns. The common use of antidepressants in the general population, in addition to the fact that their treatment pattern does not always represent the traditional episodic nature of depression, makes this particular drug class a suitable model for methodological research on drug exposure. In pharmacoepidemiology the effects of drug use in large populations are studied. Currently, pharmacoepidemiological research often uses prescribing and dispensing moments to construct drug treatment episodes in order to classify drug exposure. Construction of drug treatment episodes involve many methodological aspects, such as defining the start and the end of a treatment episode, which need to be accounted for. The objective of this thesis was to investigate methodological topics in observational research relevant to the construction of antidepressant treatment episode(s). When designing observational studies and deciding which definitions should be used to compose a study cohort and construct treatment episodes, there are some basic considerations that will influence the choice of definitions. Firstly, does the study question require knowledge on disease status of the patient or only drug use as such? Secondly, does the study aim to investigate patients who receive a prescription, regardless of whether they start therapy or not? Are there possible differences in risk profiles between patients who are experiencing their first treatment episode and those who re-initiate treatment? And finally, is the drug intended for short, episodic or long term use and what is its daily dosing scheme? When the aim is to investigate drug exposure in relation to particular outcomes, it is essential that drug treatment episodes are well defined. The methodological choices for study definitions depend on the exposure-outcome relationships under investigation. If definitions are not selected properly, it could influence study outcomes and lead to biased estimates. Nowadays, the majority of pharmacoepidemiologic research uses administrative databases to define drug treatment patterns which are subsequently associated with specific (disease) outcomes. The observed treatment patterns which are used to divide patients into different groups are often based on assumptions of the patients’ specific treatment patterns. Future research should investigate patient behavior in relation to specific treatment patterns seen in administrative databases. Thereby, we would not only describe the treatment patterns and drug taking behavior of the patient but investigate the reasons and understand why the patient exerts a specific treatment pattern. Many factors can influence patient decision making on whether and how they use their medicines and if they comply with therapy or not. These factors can differ between patients and also within a single patient over the course of time. Understanding what kind of patient behavior results in a specific treatment pattern observed in administrative databases may lead to new definitions when investigating adherence in administrative data.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Gastro-oesophageal reflux is a physiological phenomenon and occurs in every healthy subject approximately 40 times every day. Twenty percent of the general western population experiences reflux symptoms such as heartburn, regurgitation, and retrosternal pain at least once a week. Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is a condition in which symptoms or complications are brought about by reflux of gastric contents into the oesophagus. \\r\\nAmbulatory 24h pH-impedance monitoring can be performed in order to assess a relationship between reflux symptoms and reflux episodes.  This measurement can be helpful in patients who fail to respond satisfactorily to proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), and in whom the diagnosis GORD is uncertain. In this thesis we have shown that an ambulatory 24h pH-impedance measurement in patients who do not respond satisfactorily to PPI therapy should preferably be performed after the cessation of PPIs. This results in the best discrimination between patients who truly have GORD and those who do not. \\r\\nIn addition, we describe a study into different pH-electrodes (antimony, ISFET and glass pH electrodes) that can be used to measure intra-oesophageal pH. It appears that ISFET-electrodes are not influenced by temperature and components of buffer solutions, and theoretically result in the most reliable measurements. \\r\\nThe analysis of impedance tracings requires expertise and is time consuming. We have shown that computer analysis can be helpful, but is less reliable than manual analysis. \\r\\nGORD patients often report an increase of their reflux symptoms during stressful situations. In this thesis we assessed the influence of acute psychological stress on oesophageal acid perception and conclude that neither in healthy volunteers nor in GORD patients, acute psychological stress induced by an IQ test increased oesophageal acid perception.\\r\\nBesides typical reflux symptoms GORD patients often complain of excessive belching. It is known that GORD patients swallow air more frequently than healthy subjects. We have shown that this is likely the result of the experience of reflux symptoms. In theory, swallowing may reduce the uncomfortable oesophageal sensation. \\r\\nBesides normal belching (an air-escape from the stomach), we have shown that supragastric belching occurs in patients with reflux symptoms as well.  This typical belching pattern has previously been shown in patients with excessive belching as primary and presenting symptom and concerns probably a behavioral disorder. \\r\\nIn approximately 50% of the patients with reflux symptoms supragastric belches were identified. More interestingly, 50% of these supragastric belches were related to reflux episodes, suggesting that supragastric belching elicits reflux in some cases and is the patient’s response to an unpleasant esophageal sensation in others.\\r\\nIn this thesis we describe a group of patients who have large amount of intestinal gas on plain abdominal radiographs. We have shown, using ambulatory 24h pH-impedance monitoring, that these patients have high incidences of air swallows and gastric belches. Therefore, this study presents objective parameters confirming the existence of a phenomenon of excessive air swallowing or aerophagia using esophageal impedance monitoring. \\r\\nThe last chapter of this thesis concerns a study into the effect of speech therapy on the symptoms of patients with excessive supragastric belching. In more than 50% of the patients, speech therapy resulted in significant improvement of the severity of symptoms. Therefore, we conclude that speech therapy performed by a well-informed speech therapist leads to a significant symptom reduction in patients with excessive supragastric belching.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Ventral and incisional hernia repair is one of the most frequently performed operations in daily surgical practice. Laparoscopic ventral and incisional hernia repair (LVIHR) is gaining increasing adoption in surgical practice. It has theoretical advantages but improvements in technique can still be made. The aim of this thesis is to study complications and techniques of LVIHR. Questions that we try to answer are: — What causes recurrence after LVIHR? — How can we treat chronic post-operative pain? — How should the mesh be fixated? — What are the clinical consequences of intra-abdominal mesh placement? In Chapter 2 all nine recurrences in a series of 505 LVIHRs were studied. We conclude that a risk factor for the development of recurrence in repair of an incisional hernia appears to be an incomplete coverage of the whole original incision by mesh. Chapter 3 describes a fatal case of intestinal ischemia after LVIHR. Intestinal ischemia therefore seems to be more related to laparoscopy in patients at risk for cardiovascular complications in general than to LVIHR specifically. In Chapter 4 we analyzed the effect of suture removal in 6 patients with persistent post-operative pain following LVIHR. We conclude that up to now there is no one single treatment option for chronic post-operative pain after LVIHR. In selected cases removal of transabdominal sutures can be beneficial. In Chapter 5 the results of a randomized study on mesh-fixation technique and pain and quality of life after LVIHR in 199 patients are presented. We conclude that there appear to be no significant differences in post-operative pain and quality of life between the three studied mesh-fixation techniques. In Chapter 6 a study investigating the impact of mesh-fixation technique on operative time in laparoscopic umbilical hernia repair in 138 patients is presented. We found a small but significant time advantage for the technique using only tacks. On the basis of these last two studies we cannot advise the use of one of the studied mesh-fixation techniques over the other. In Chapter 7 seventy-two reoperations after LVIHR are described. Three specific observations can be made: (1) no relaparoscopies had to be converted, (2) no inadvertent bowel lesions were encountered during adhesiolysis, and (3) SAOs were practically devoid of peri- and postoperative complications. We therefore conclude that the clinical consequences of intra-abdominal mesh placement during LVIHR seem insignificant. Final conclusions: What causes recurrence after LVIHR? An incomplete coverage of the whole original incision by mesh is a risk factor for developing a recurrence after incisional hernia repair. How can we treat chronic post-operative pain? There is no single treatment option for chronic pain after LVIHR. How should the mesh be fixated? Presently we cannot advise on what method of mesh fixation to use in LVIHR. What are the clinical consequences of intra-abdominal mesh placement? The clinical consequences of intra-abdominal mesh placement during LVIHR seem insignificant.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Age-related hearing loss (ARHL) is the most common cause of acquired hearing impairment in dogs. Diagnosis requires objective electrophysiological tests (brainstem evoked response audiometry [BERA]) evaluating the entire audible frequency range in dogs. In our laboratory a method was developed to deliver tone bursts ranging in frequency from 1 - 32 kHz for frequency-specific assessment of the cochlea in dogs. Brainstem auditory evoked responses to a click (CS) and to 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, and 32 kHz tone burst stimulations (TS) were compared at 80 dB sound pressure level (SPL) stimulus intensity in 10 clinically-healthy dogs and thresholds were determined for all specific frequencies tested. Marked differences in the thresholds for the different stimulations were found, the lowest being for the click and for 12 and 16 kHz toneburst stimulations. The thresholds for all other toneburst stimulations were significantly higher than for the click stimulation. A cross-sectional and a longitudinal study on age-related changes in audiograms in dogs, was conducted using the technique described above. Auditory thresholds at all frequencies tested were significantly higher in elderly than in young and middle-aged dogs. The longitudinal study demonstrated a progressive increase in thresholds associated with aging, starting around 8-10 years of age and being most pronounced in the middle- to high-frequency region (8-32 kHz). Having found audiometric proof of frequency-specific age-related changes in hearing in dogs, histological cochlear lesions in dogs with audiometric ARHL were studied. Cochlear lesions were found in all geriatric dogs. Not only was significant loss of spiral ganglion cells found, but also of outer hair cells and a reduction in stria vascularis cross-sectional area. The histological abnormalities found were primarily in the basal turn, which was consistent with the occurrence of the largest threshold shifts and lowest absolute thresholds in the middle- to high-frequency regions (8-32 kHz). Individual audiograms reflected the severity and location of cochlear lesions in all cases. The use of hearing aids in dogs has only anecdotally been mentioned but hasn’t met with great clinical success. The Vibrant Soundbridge (VSB) is an active, semi-implantable, middle ear hearing device that has been used in people who cannot benefit from conventional hearing aids. In a feasibility study in three cadavers we demonstrated that the VSB could be successfully implanted using a lateral approach to the tympanic bulla and with positioning of the floating mass transducer of the VSB in the round window niche. To evaluate the technique in dogs with ARHL, three dogs with audiometric ARHL were implanted unilaterally with a VSB implant. The implantation procedure did not affect residual hearing as measured with BERA. The functionality of the implants was demonstrated by the finding of decreased auditory thresholds on auditory steady-state evoked response testing. Measurable benefit from the VSB on hearing thresholds in the implanted ear was demonstrated. Owner satisfaction and results in client-owned dogs with ARHL have yet to be established.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['DNA vaccination is an appealing strategy of active vaccination, leading to the intracellular production of the encoding antigen which results in an efficient activation of an antigen specific immune response. Intradermal DNA tattooing was recently developed as a simple and robust method to induce antigen expression and T cell responses. This thesis focused on the pharmaceutical production and formulation, and the optimal delivery of DNA vaccines administered by DNA tattooing. First, a process is described for the production of naked DNA vaccines for clinical trials. The developed production process was reproducible, with a high quality, stability and yield of plasmid DNA. The manufactured melanoma DNA vaccine, pDERMATT (encoding Tetanus Toxin Fragment C and a MART-1 epitope), showed a robust T cell response in a humanized murine model vaccinated by DNA tattooing and is currently under clinical evaluation. Next, the effect of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a common contamination, was assessed. The presence of LPS in DNA vaccines, applied via DNA tattooing, neither induced systemic toxicity nor influenced antigen expression in mice. LPS content was not associated with a statistically significant increase in T cell response. The development of an ex vivo human skin model that allows the longitudinal measurement of vaccine induced antigen expression in intact skin is described. This skin model demonstrated that the majority of cells transfected by DNA tattooing are epidermal keratinocytes, with only a small fraction (~1%) of antigen-positive epidermal Langerhans cells. Furthermore, we showed that an increase in DNA concentration, needle depth and tattoo time all significantly increase antigen expression, with DNA concentration forming the most critical variable. The transfection efficiency of DNA tattooing appeared to be extremely low, only 1 out of 5x106 to 5x109 copies of plasmid applied is taken up, transcribed and translated. To further increase this low transfection efficiency, we developed a nanoparticle formulation for the delivery of dermal DNA vaccines. It was shown that the shielding of the surface charge of a cationic nanoparticle (both lipoplexes and polyplexes) via PEGylation is essential to induce both antigen expression and immunogenicity. NonPEGylated particles carry a positive zeta potential and therefore likely bind to negatively charged tissue matrix macromolecules, preventing cellular binding and internalization. Subsequently, the effect of tattooing on plasmid DNA integrity (supercoiled (SC) content) was assessed. DNA tattooing only resulted in minor damage to pDNA ( <3% SC pDNA reduction) and only open circular (OC) pDNA formation. Surprisingly, antigen expression levels and immunogenicity upon DNA tattooing of SC or OC pDNA were equal in a murine model, whereas tattooing in ex vivo human skin resulted in a significant higher level of antigen expression for the SC form. DNA topology did not influence expression in human skin when formulated as PEGylated polyplexes. To further increase the transfection efficiency, we described the combination of DNA tattooing with electroporation. First, it was shown that tattooing immediately followed by electroporation (“electrotattooing”) can increase antigen expression levels in human skin by a factor of 3. Even more interestingly, electrotattooing of a polyplex formulation boosts antigen expression up to levels 20-fold higher compared to tattooing of naked DNA.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Intravascular volume after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage A subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) from a ruptured cerebral aneurysm is a devastating disorder with an often poor prognosis. The occurrence of delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) is one of the most important factors determining outcome in patients who have survived the first hours after the hemorrhage. Hypotension and hypovolemia have been associated with an increased risk for DCI after SAH. The aim of the research presented in this thesis was to study the relation between the presumed and the actual condition of the systemic circulation and thereby find a way to improve hemodynamic management after aneurysmal SAH. In a prospective observational study in 50 patients, we assessed the effectiveness of fluid balance guided fluid therapy (current standard therapy) in maintaining normovolemia. Circulating blood volume (CBV) was measured with pulse dye densitometry (PDD) on alternating days during the first two weeks after SAH. We found that hypo- and hypervolemia occurred frequently but found no association between CBV and the daily fluid balance or between CBV and a cumulative fluid balance, adjusted for insensible loss through perspiration and respiration. In a next study on 43 patients, we asked ICU- and Medium Care Unit nurses to predict the present volume status as hypo-, normo- or hypervolemic. They could base their assessments on all usually available hemodynamic data. These assessments were compared with the actual CBV, that was measured daily during the first ten days after SAH. The results showed that deviations from normovolemia occurred frequently but that most instances were not recognized as such, which resulted in a very low sensitivity of the predictions. In a prospective controlled study in 102 patients with recent SAH we compared fluid management guided by daily measurements of CBV to conventional fluid balance guided fluid therapy, during the first 10 days after SAH. In the intervention group, with fluid management guided by CBV, fewer measurements were in the severe hypovolemic range (6.7% versus 17.1%) and a smaller part of patients had measurements indicating severe hypovolemia (39% versus 54%). Pulmonary edema (PED) after SAH is often seen as a sign of hypervolemia and treated as such with diuretics, inotropics and a reduction in fluid intake. We prospectively studied CBV, fluid balance and cardiac index and compared it between patients who did or did not develop PED. The results showed that patients developing PED had actually a lower mean CBV than those without PED and had CBV measurements in the hypovolemic range. Patients with PED after SAH must be considered as hypovolemic and measures taken to counteract the pulmonary edema must be balanced against the risk of worsening hypovolemia. Results from the studies in this thesis show that a normal volume status after SAH is not easy to achieve or to maintain. A probable cause is that SAH results in multiple organ dysfunctions and a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). A coordinated multidisciplinary approach of the SAH patient would be appropriate, in research as well as in patient care.'],\n",

In order to answer this question, chapter 2 describes first of all the heart of the problems regarding written-down claims, after which the framework for assessing the regulations regarding written-down claims is defined in chapter 3. Subsequently chapters 4 and 5 describe the way in which claims and debts ought to be valued. Chapter 6 deals with the regulation of article 13ba CITA 1969, regarding the conversion and hybridisation of written-down claims. Subsequently chapter 7 describes the waiver of claims. First of all this is viewed from the perspective of the debtor, focusing on the waiver profit exemption. The treatment of the creditor is described next and particulary on article 13ba CITA 1969, which applies if the creditor has a participation in the debtor. This chapter also deals with the regulations of article 15ac, section 2, CITA 1969 and the ancillary measure of article 8, section 4, CITA 1969. These regulations govern the concurrence of the waiver profit exemption with a company that is or has been part of a fiscal unity. Chapter 8 describes the regulations of article 13b CITA 1969, which regard the transfer of written-down claims. Chapter 9 handles the problems of written-down claims in concurrence with the fiscal unity regime. The regulations of article 15ab, sections 6 and 7, as well as 15aj, section 2, CITA 1969, which govern the valuation of mutual claims and debts at the time a company becomes part of, or ceases to be part of, a fiscal unity, are also described in this chapter. Chapter 10 describes the concurrence between the regulations regarding written-down claims and the regulations of articles 14, 14a and 14b CITA 1969, regarding assets and liabilities transactions, legal demergers and legal mergers, as well as the concurrence with share-for-share transfers. Finally, chapter 11 contains a comprehensive evaluation of the regulations regarding written-down claims. The conclusions are: 1) the regulations regarding written-down claims need to be improved; 2) the system of the revaluation reserve of article 13ba CITA 1969 needs to be extended to article 13b and 15ab section 6 CITA 1969. 3) the system of the revaluation reserve of article 13ba CITA 1969 should not be extended to the articles 14, 14a and 14b CITA 1969. 4) the regulation regarding the waiver profit exemption ought to take deferred profits into account in the future. 5) the regulations of article 15ac, section 2, CITA 1969 and the ancillary regulations of article 8, section 4, CITA 1969, which regard/apply to the concurrence between the waiver profit exemption and a company that is (or was) part of a fiscal unity, ought to be repealed; 6) the regulations regarding fiscal unity companies need to be improved in several other ways. 7) the regulations need (technical) improvement on many counts.

       "  'Description': ['This thesis was conducted with the main objectives (i) to calculate costs of mastitis and cost-efficiency of mastitis management measures and (ii) to acquire insights in the economic decision behaviour of dairy farmers with respect to mastitis management. Animal health economics is a decision supporting science, based on a decision making function of evaluating and choosing between alternative strategies on animal diseases. The potential economic importance of diseases such as mastitis is not uniform across farms, regions or countries, and control measures justified in one context may not be economically worthwhile in another. The average costs of mastitis were calculated as €77 per year per cow present on the farm under quota situation. Most of the farmers (72%) underestimated the costs of mastitis on their farm. The main reason for this underestimation was that farmers underestimated production losses caused by cows with an elevated somatic cell count. The costs of mastitis as calculated by the farmers varied between €17 and €200 per cow per year on farm level. It was found that farms that have a comparable incidence of clinical mastitis and bulk tank somatic cell count may have different costs of mastitis. Because decisions are often based on the perception of a problem, farm specific cost calculations can help to give a better insight in the magnitude of the decision. This can improve the adoption rate of advised management measures. Decisions are not only based on economic parameters or other quantified characteristics. Mastitis management is known as one of the fields where farmer decision making often deviates from recommendations based on rational standard-economic models and is often contrary to advices given by veterinarians and other advisors. Farmers can have different motivations to decide on the implementation of management measures to improve the udder health situation on the farm. It is necessary to understand the important motivators of dairy farmers to be able to successfully transfer knowledge and technology to the dairy farm. The tools developed in this thesis can provide support in economic decisions, which can improve the motivation of a farmer to improve mastitis management. In general, farmers prefer to invest in short or long term investments, rather than to invest in extra labour or in changing routines. The large variation in preferences between farmers showed the importance of including this information in farm specific decision support. Not every farmer can earn money by improving the udder health situation by adopting new management measures, but many can. Clear differences between the costs and benefits of management measures exist for different farm situations. The results of this thesis have contributed to our understanding of the decision making process of dairy farmers regarding mastitis management.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The circulatory system, consisting of the heart, blood, blood vessels and lymphatic vessels is one of the major organ systems required for maintaining homeostasis in humans. Its main functions are the transport of nutrients, gases, signaling molecules and cells to and from tissues to maintain an array of body parameters including tissue oxygen levels, temperature and pH, and to help fight diseases. During recent years, the zebrafish has emerged as an important and instructive model organism for studying development of the vertebrate circulatory system. In this thesis we use the unique possibility to combine genetics with in vivo imaging in the zebrafish to get insights into several aspects of the development of the circulatory system. We have generated a transgenic zebrafish line based on regulatory elements of the zebrafish VEGF receptor flt1 (flt1enh:rfp). This line allows the identification of arterial, venous and lymphatic endothelial cells in embryonic and adult zebrafish. Interestingly, a fourth vessel type is identified in adults (lymph-arteries) with distinct flt1enh:rfp expression levels. Lymph-arteries represent the afferent component of the lymphatic vasculature in lower vertebrates. We further analyse several mutant zebrafish lines identified from forward genetic screens. One of these mutants display dilation of blood vessels throughout the embryo. We show that the phenotype is due to a mutation in cavernous cerebral malformation 1 (ccm1). This gene is associated with a human syndrome, which presents as a cerebral hemorrhage and dilated-vessel phenotype at multiple sites throughout the body. We show that the ccm1 gene acts cell-autonomously in endothelial cells and is not associated with defects in arteriovenous differentiation. The secand mutants we have analysed have a defect in arterial differentiation and hematopoiesis. The mutant phenotype is due to a mutation in T-cell acute leukemia 1 (tal1). Over- or misexpression of tal1 is a frequent cause of leukemia in humans. We show that tal1 has an additional role during heart development. Development of the inner lining of the heart (the endocardium) is severely perturbed, and is associated with defects in cardiac morphogenesis. Finally, we report the identification and characterization a mutants lack lymphatic vessels and have a defect in venous angiogenic sprouting. We show that the phenotype is due to a mutation in collagen and calcium-binding EGF domain containing protein 1(ccbe1). This gene has no previous described role in (lymph) vascular development, and presents a novel candidate gene for human syndromes associated with defects in lymphangiogenesis. Since many of the genes essential for embryonic vascular development are required for the activation of blood and lymphatic vessel growth in adult pathology, identifying these genes involved in vascular development, or understand the interactions between known genes will allow the development of new drugs that target these genes in order to inhibit or promote vessel formation'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Home UVB phototherapy for psoriasis'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Psoriasis is a chronic skin disorder, that is mostly treated with creams and ointments. When topical treatment fails, narrowband ultraviolet B (UVB) light becomes the primary treatment option. UVB treatment is nearly always carried out in an outpatient clinic, requiring patients to attend the clinic during working hours several times a week. To overcome this drawback, home UVB treatment was introduced in the 1970s. Ever since, however, the effectiveness and safety of this therapy have been debated. The results of chapter 2 demonstrate that very little research on home UVB treatment has been conducted. Literature is scarce and personal, non-evidence based opinions are widespread, while the official opinion suggests being cautious. Only a randomised study can settle the ongoing discussions concerning the advisability of home UVB phototherapy for psoriasis. Chapter 3 presents the protocol of a randomised clinical trial comparing home UVB treatment with outpatient UVB treatment. Both treatments were performed in a setting reflecting daily practice, a so-called ‘pragmatic’ design. In chapter 4 the methodological particulars of pragmatic and non-inferiority designs are explained. The results of the clinical trial (chapter 5) demonstrate that home and outpatient UVB treatment are equally effective and equally safe. Quality of life was also similar. Patients treated at home, however, experienced a lower burden of treatment, were more satisfied, while the waiting time for home treatment was mostly found acceptable or not a problem. Most patients said to prefer home UVB treatment over outpatient treatment in the future. In chapter 6 the relation between an improved patient assessed psoriasis severity and a better quality of life is specified. Also gender, age and employment status turned out to be important predictors of quality of life. The impact of psoriasis on quality adjusted life years (QALYs) was considerable and comparable to the impact of other chronic diseases. In chapter 7 the EQ-5D and SF-6D utility scores (both used to calculate QALYs) were compared for their agreement and usefulness in psoriasis studies. Agreement between individual measurements of both instruments was poor, but the mean scores displayed a similar sensitivity to change and hence a similar course during the study. In this population the use of either instrument may yield equal incremental costs-QALY ratios. The results of the economic evaluation (chapter 8) show very small and not significant differences in costs and effects (QALYs) between both groups, yielding home UVB phototherapy a cost-effective intervention. From a more clinical perspective, the number of days with a so-called ‘relevant treatment effect’ was taken into account. Overall, home UVB treatment appeared cost-effective, but cost-effectiveness may be improved by reducing waiting times for home UVB treatment. In chapter 9, the main findings are summarised and discussed. Home UVB treatment was proven to be an effective, safe and cost-effective treatment that it is preferred by most patients. Therefore the positioning of home UVB treatment should be reconsidered and agreed upon, and guidelines should be adapted to reflect this view. In addition, home UVB treatment should be routinely reimbursed and provision should be improved.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['In this thesis a different principle to determine the value of diagnostic parameters and to install the proper, individualized, surgical treatment for stress urinary incontinence is presented. The aim of the first part of this thesis was to evaluate the value of urodynamic investigation (UDI) in the pre-operative work-up of mid-urethral sling (MUS) surgery and to identify risk factors for failure after three different MUS procedures. Mixed urinary incontinence (MUI), previous incontinence surgery and detrusor overactivity (DO) were significantly related to failure of MUS procedures. However there were no predictive urodynamic parameters for failure in patients with MUI or previous incontinence surgery. Then a comparison was made between the risk factors for failure of Tension-free Vaginal Tape (TVT) and Transobturator Tape (TOT) procedures (Monarc and TVT-O). Risk factors for failure were MUI and DO at urodynamics in the TVT group compared to a history of previous incontinence surgery and a low (<20 cm H2O) mean urethral closure pressure at urodynamics in the TOT group. Therefore results of medical history and pre-operative urodynamics can aid in selecting the proper MUS procedure. Decision rules were developed based on medical history and physical examination to predict a high probability group of women with DO and/or a low mean urethral closure pressure (urodynamic risk factors found in the previous studies). The following decision rules could be formulated: women are likely to benefit from pre-operative urodynamics if they: 1) are 53 years of age or older; or 2) have a history of prior incontinence surgery and are at least 29 years of age; or 3) have nocturia complaints and are at least 36 years of age. If pre-operative urodynamics would be omitted in women in the low probability group, in our population, pre-operative urodynamics could be reduced by 29%. Before implementation in clinical practice, these rules should be validated. The concept of the Surgical Therapeutic Index (STI) is introduced to compare TVT and TOT procedures. The STI is defined as the ratio between the cure- and complication rate. Two months after surgery the STI is significantly higher after TOT whereas 12 months after surgery results of STI’s are equal. The explanation is more durable cure rates and declining long-term side effects after TVT procedures. To determine patient expectations regarding wanted and unwanted sequels of MUS procedures a patient preference study (40 patients) combined with a questionnaire study (20 experts) was conducted. Seventeen different sequels were evaluated. Patients and physicians agreed on the most important sequels like cure, improvement and functional complications. Time to resume work after the operation and dyspareunia were among the highest rated sequels in the patient group and should be regarded in pre-operative counselling and future clinical trials. At last the importance of long-term follow-up of surgical procedures is recognized. Therefore a prospective cohort study was performed to compare outcome and quality of life after 2-4 years of two TOT procedures, Monarc and TVT-O. No significant differences were observed in cure rate, complications and quality of life.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Analysis of rhizosphere bacterial communities in Arabidopsis: impact of plant defense signaling'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['In the rhizosphere, numerous microbial and plant-microbe interactions occur. Of special interest is the ability of specific rhizosphere bacteria to elicit induced systemic resistance (ISR), a state of enhanced defensive capacity of the plant that is effective against a wide range of pathogens. The goal to minimize the use of agrochemicals in crop protection stimulates the development of practical applications of ISR-eliciting bacteria as an environmentally friendly alternative. However, application of these bacteria on a large scale and at high densities may perturb the indigenous microflora. This thesis is focused on effects of plant defense signaling on the indigenous bacterial rhizosphere microflora. Population densities of the bacterial and Pseudomonas spp. microflora were determined by selective dilution plating, whereas bacterial community structures were studied by DGGE analysis of amplified 16S rDNA, obtained from DNA directly extracted from rhizosphere and bulk soil. As model plant we used Arabidopsis thaliana accession Col-0, since numerous defense signaling mutants and transgenic lines are available and rhizobacteria-mediated ISR has been characterized in detail in this species. To determine if the indigenous bacterial microflora in the rhizosphere is affected by plant defenses, Arabidopsis genotypes with altered defense signaling were used. Whereas no differences were observed on microbial community structures, in some defense signal-transduction mutants rhizosphere population densities of culturable bacteria or Pseudomonas spp. were different from those of the parent Col-0. These differences were observed only in one type of soil. Apparently, soil is a predominant factor shaping microbial communities. In a complementary approach, jasmonic acid (JA)- or salicylic acid (SA)-dependent defenses were chemically activated by application of these hormones. Neither the abundance, nor the community structure of the bacterial rhizosphere microflora was affected by activation of the JA- or SA-dependent responses. Whereas Pseudomonas putida WCS358r and Pseudomonas fluorescens WCS417r elicit ISR against the bacterial leaf pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) in Arabidopsis, P. fluorescens WCS374r does not. The root-colonizing capacity of these three bacterial strains was studied on wild-type Arabidopsis and on a non ISR-expressing mutant, myb72. Whereas WCS358r and WCS417r proliferated on the roots of the wild type, this was not the case for WCS374r. However, none of the strains proliferated on the roots of the myb72 mutant. Apparently, MYB72 is not only essential for the expression of ISR, but also influences root colonization by rhizobacteria. Metabolic profiling revealed that treatment of wild-type plants and the myb72 mutant with the Pseudomonas spp. strains significantly altered the amounts of sugars, organic acids and amino acids. Most annotated metabolite fragments could be linked to known plant-microbe or plant-pathogen interactions, but not to the expression of ISR. Finally, population densities of total culturable bacteria and Pseudomonas spp. in the phyllosphere were determined upon infection with Pst. Arabidopsis mutants differed in their sensitivity to Pst and the most sensitive mutants also had the highest bacterial and Pseudomonas spp. populations on their leaves. Collectively, these results suggest that control of plant diseases by elicitation of induced systemic resistance will not significantly affect the indigenous rhizosphere bacterial microflora.'],\n",

However, even highly selective, FDA approved drugs can have the potential to bind to other unintended targets, possibly leading to side effects. Some reported side effects observed during ED treatment include headache, flushing and transient visual problems. Understanding the molecular causes of such side effects is an important part of the drug development process and can help in the understanding of the mechanisms of drug action. In the research described in this thesis, the interactome of several, closely related, PDE5 inhibitors was characterized to obtain further insight in their ability to bind proteins other than PDE5. The pull-down affinity experiments were optimized to decrease binding of non-specific proteins. The optimized pull-down assay was then combined with high resolution quantitative proteomics to get a clear and unbiased insight into the protein interactors of PDE5 inhibitors. Several new specific interacting proteins were identified and verified and it was shown that slight modifications of the inhibitors can alter their specificity to favor these new protein targets. Throughout the work described in this thesis it has become evident that chemical proteomics can be an effective approach to describe the interactome of drugs but that it can also be used to identify potential new targets of known compounds, opening up the possibility to identify new potential therapeutic uses for known and approved drugs.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['IL-7 and TSLP as therapeutic targets for rheumatoid arthritis Interleukin (IL)-7 is a potent immunostimulatory cytokine. In this thesis we demonstrate that IL-7 and a IL-7-related cytokine thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) stimulate inflammatory responses that can aggravate rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The persistence of IL-7 activity and levels upon TNF-alpha blockade in patients with RA suggests that blockade of the IL-7 pathway is a potential target in treatment-refractory RA. IL-7 activity is dependent on signaling through the IL-7R. Increased IL-7R expression was found in RA synovial tissue. CD4 T cells from RA synovial fluid and tissue strongly expressed IL-7R, as well as a percentage of B cells and macrophages. IL-7R+ T cells lacking FoxP3-expression strongly proliferated, compared to non-proliferating IL-7R- T cells with high levels of FoxP3. In line with this, blockade of IL-7R signaling by soluble human IL-7R inhibited IFN-gamma production by cells from RA patients. To further support the importance of IL-7/IL-7R-mediated inflammatory responses in RA the role of this inflammatory pathway was studied in experimental arthritis. Increased IL-7 in serum and inflamed paws of arthritic mice was demonstrated. Comparable to RA patients, local IL-7 levels in mice correlated with arthritis severity. Neutralization of IL-7 inhibited joint inflammation, demonstrating an important role for IL-7-driven immunity in experimental arthritis. Furthermore, prophylactic and therapeutic IL-7R blockade decreased severity of experimental arthritis, associated by reduced T-cell numbers, T-cell cytokines (IFN-gamma, IL-5 and IL-17), and many proinflammatory mediators, including IL-1-beta and TNF-alpha. Since TSLP, in conjunction with the TSLP receptor, also utilizes the IL-7R for signaling, blockade of IL-7R-driven immunity might also influence TSLP-induced immune activation. Therefore, the role of TSLP in arthritis was also addressed. TSLP and IL-7 strongly increased arthritis severity, but only IL-7 increased radiological joint destruction, associated with increased intensity of cell infiltrates, cartilage damage, bone erosions, and osteoclast activity. Both IL-7 and TSLP administration induced expansion of memory T cells, associated with increased numbers of IFN-gamma- and IL-17-producing T cells by IL-7, and increased IL-4-producing T cells by TSLP. Both, IL-7 and TSLP increased several proinflammatory mediators, such as CD40L and chemokine MDC. Thus, IL-7 and TSLP enhanced arthritis by differential regulation of arthritogenic responses. In support of the role of TSLP in arthritis we documented that arthritis severity was strongly down-regulated in TSLPR-deficient mice. This was associated with unchanged thymic and splenic cellnumbers, but strongly reduced radiological joint damage, and reduced inflammation, cartilage erosions, periosteal exostosis, bone erosions and numbers of TRAP+ osteoclasts. Mediators of T-cell activation, chemokines, vascular activation and angiogenesis factors, and tissue destructive factors were all reduced in TSLPR-deficient mice. Furthermore, interruption of both IL-7R and TSLPR pathways resulted in additive disease suppression almost completely preventing immunopathology. The data presented in this thesis reveal the capacity of IL-7 and TSLP and their receptors to strongly promote arthritis and joint destruction, and demonstrates the distinct arthritogenic contributions of both cytokines. These data indicate that targeting of IL-7 and TSLP and their receptors might be new strategies to control (rheumatoid) arthritis.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) protein functions as a switch in a number of receptor signaling cascades. One of these cascades is the high affinity IgE receptor (Fc?RI) signaling pathway. Fc?RI consists of an ?-, ?- and two ?-chains. The ?- and ?-chains have intracellular an Immunoreceptor Tyrosine based Activation Motif (ITAM). The ITAM sequence consists of Tyr-Xxx-Xxx-(Leu/Ile)-(Xxx6-8)-Tyr-Xxx-Xxx-(Leu/Ile), in which Xxx can be any amino acid and the Tyr-Xxx-Xxx-(Leu/Ile) sequences are, if phosphorylated, the binding epitopes of the SH2 domains of Syk. Upon IgE stimulation of the receptor, the ITAM motive is doubly phosphorylated. After this phosphorylation, Syk is recruited to the membrane where it becomes active. The first event in this activation process is the binding of the tandem SH2 domain (tSH2) of Syk to the phosphorylated ITAM motive on the ?-chain. Syk activation eventually leads to degranulation of the cell and thus release of mediators. Overstimulation of this pathway leads to allergic responses and therefore Syk is an interesting target for anti-allergic therapy. Recently, we have found that binding of Syk tSH2 to an ITAM peptide causes a significant change in the dynamics of tSH2. This change could imply that a change in the inter SH2 distance is necessary for Syk activation. To gain more insight into the functioning of Syk tSH2 we decided to replace the amino acid residues between the two binding epitopes of ITAM. Replacement with rigid building blocks preserved the high binding affinity. This rigid ITAM mimic was used in a pull-down approach to identify the proteins binding to it. Furthermore, the ITAM mimic was conjugated to different cell penetrating peptides, to evaluate the intracellular effects. The ITAM mimic proved to be a stimulator of mast cells degranulation. A rigid ITAM mimic with a larger linker between the SH2 binding epitopes was found to be an inhibitor of Syk kinase activity, as found by microarray experiments. In addition, a series of photoswitchable azobenzene-containing ITAM mimics was prepared. The interaction of the cis – and trans isomers with Syk tSH2 was assayed with SPR binding studies. For the smallest photoswitchable peptide a large difference in binding affinity between the cis – and trans isomer was found. Furthermore, one ITAM-derived tetrapeptidic SH2 binding epitope was conjugated to dendrimers via click chemistry to create a series of functional phosphopeptide-containing dendrimers ranging from a monovalent to an octavalent dendrimer. The tetra- and octavalent dendrimer had high nanomolar affinity for Syk tSH2, indicating a multivalency effect.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The challenge of the mucosal gut associated immune system is to remain unresponsive to food products and commensal microbiota, while mounting an appropriate immune response towards pathogens. This implicates the necessity of tight immune regulation within the gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). Imbalance between tolerance and immunity (e.g. intestinal homeostasis) contributes to the pathogenesis of intestinal diseases like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and food allergies. The first part of this thesis examined strategies to enhance the GALT function and find possible therapies for intestinal inflammation. Prevention of entrance of bacterial products like lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into intestinal tissue will diminish immune activation in the gut. Alkaline phosphatase, expressed by intestinal epithelial cells, is able to detoxify LPS. Administration of alkaline phosphatase in a mouse model for intestinal inflammation indeed reduced disease, but only when severe epithelial damage had occurred. An approach including AP treatment holds a therapeutic promise in case of severe IBD. Other studies on intestinal inflammation aimed to increase regulatory cells in the inflamed tissue via administration of heat shock proteins (HSP). It has been shown that administration of mycobacterial HSP results in the induction regulatory T cells in animal models for rheumatoid arthritis, and that these regulatory T cells ameliorate disease onset. However, administration of HSP did not reduce intestinal inflammation in mouse models, probably due to the acute character of those models. The second part of this thesis investigated the changes in the GALT, immediately after induction of peanut allergy in a mouse model. Furthermore, the effects of food components and drugs on allergic responses were evaluated. Normally, feeding a protein induces immunologic non-responsiveness called oral tolerance. Administration of the mucosal adjuvant cholera toxin induces allergic sensitization to co-administered proteins in mice. We found that induction of allergy resulted in a profound decrease in the percentage of gammadelta T cells in intestinal tissues. Blockade of the gammadelta TCR in vivo (using a specific antibody) resulted in elevated food allergic responses upon sensitization with peanut. This demonstrates a regulatory role for gammadelta T cells, suggesting that targeting gammadelta T cells in the intestine may contribute to strategies to prevent and possibly treat food allergy. Food industry claims a beneficial effect of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) on allergic responses. However, feeding mice n-3 PUFA-rich diets resulted in increased mast cell responses after induction of peanut allergy compared to mice fed with normal diets. Whether this effect is the result of modulation of fatty acid-derived prostaglandin contents or of a direct effect on mast cells is subject to further research. The pain-killer diclofenac also enhanced peanut allergic responses in mice but only when other circumstances are also in favor of allergic sensitization. This finding signifies a relevant risk for the human situation and needs further investigation. Together these studies demonstrate both beneficial and detrimental effects of environmental factors (bacterial products, food components and drugs) on mucosal immune responses in the gut. More research is needed to evaluate the risks and the therapeutic possibilities of present findings.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Infections caused by the small ruminant lentiviruses (SRLV) of sheep (maedi visna virus) and goats (caprine arthritis encephalitis virus) are a serious economical threat to small ruminant farming particularly in the more intensive settings like dairy farms. Revenue is ultimately negatively influenced by decreased milk production, reduced birth-rate and bodyweight and trade limitations 1, 2, 3. Chronically infected animals have a poor body condition and may display progressive dyspnoea, painful arthritis and indurative mastitis, factors that markedly affect animal welfare. However, in well managed flocks overt clinical disease is hardly seen because affected animals are culled in an early stage of this perniciously progressive disease, hence the only sign is an increased replacement rate. The infection spreads lactogenically from dam to progeny through colostrum and/or milk and horizontally on one hand via the natural close contact between the dam and her progeny 4, 5 and on the other hand between flock members via direct and indirect contacts 6, 7. Vertical -prenatal- transmission is generally considered to be of low or no importance. Infections are microscopically characterised by lymphoid infiltrations and inflammatory lesions in the lungs, the udder, the carpal joints and the central nervous system 8, 9, 10. There is no cure for this usually slowly progressive disease. Identification of infected individuals by laboratory testing and strict farm and animal sanitary management are corner-stones of programs for control and are at the same time the only tools available for reducing the prevalence of infection. Caution with respect to the reliability of laboratory testing for SRLV infections is augmented by the growing knowledge of the RNA viral genomes and their expression products. Immense genetic heterogeneity hampers protein as well as viral genome based tests. Due to sub-optimal laboratory tests generating false negative results, an early diagnosis is easily missed which will lead to spread of infection. This reduces the farmers’ support for control programs which was already under pressure because of the costs involved, the low direct market returns and the ‘invisibility’ of the long-term returns. Improvement of the diagnostic tools combined with improved test strategies will enable early detection of infection. Moreover, especially, the use of milk samples in stead of blood and in particular the use of bulk milk samples for the antibody detection as well as the molecular biological detection of SRLV infections could lead to considerable cost reduction. The small ruminant lentiviruses, a subfamily of the retroviruses, will need continuous attention because they are prone to diagnostic test escape as a result of their rapid evolving genomes 7, 11, 12 with consequences at the genomic and epitope level 13. Thus, the use of complementary tests is currently required and molecular-epidemiological surveillance is a prerequisite.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Although, the discovery of antibiotics has revolutionised the treatment of infections, the growing phenomenon of bacterial resistance, among others due to the use and abuse of antimicrobial agents, is now threatening to take us back to a pre-antibiotic era. Continuously, microorganisms subtly change their genetic and molecular makeup which helps them to escape the threat caused by the frequent application of antibiotics. After the discovery of antibiotic resistant bacteria phenotypic susceptibility tests have become an essential component of infectious disease management. However, improved knowledge of the genetic backbone of the numerous resistance mechanisms has resulted in the development of various molecular tools, like for example PCR tests. The aim of this thesis was the construction of versatile molecular tools to screen for the presence of a large set of antibiotic resistance (AR) genes in the food related microorganism, Salmonella, Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) and Bifidobacterium. It describes the development of a glass slide oligonucleotide microarray in combination with a random primed genomic DNA labelling for the detection of multiple AR gene targets. The microarray currently represents over 430 AR genes through a total of 223 oligonucleotides which comprise determinants encoding resistance to the antibiotic classes; aminoglycoside, beta-lactam, chloramphenicol, MLS, sulfonamide, tetracycline, trimethoprim, and vancomycin. This microarray platform was used to screen a large set of Salmonella isolates belonging to over 25 different serovars for the presence of AR determinants. The generated hybridization data were consistent to the general findings concerning antibiotic resistance in Salmonella. In addition, within the EU project called “ACE-ART” the microarray was applied to analyze numerous sensitive and resistant LAB and bifidobacteria isolates for the possible presence of AR genes. Research was focused on the most frequently identified resistances in the genera studied; erythromycin and tetracycline. The most commonly identified AR gene was tet(W), encoding for a tetracycline ribosomal protection protein. Moreover, tet(M) and tet(S) were also frequently characterized, like the erythromycin resistance determinant erm(B). However, some AR genes were atypical for LAB and bifidobacteria. For example, the phenomenon of mosaic tetracycline resistance genes, identified in Bifidobacterium thermophilum and Lactobacillus johnsonii was described for the first time. In addition, the erythromycin- and clindamycin resistance determinant erm(X) as a part of a Tn5432-like transposon is also a novel result for Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. animalis and Bifidobacterium thermophilum. The transposonal location of this AR gene excludes these isolates from being used as probiotics. The thesis also introduces a novel microarray platform using ArrayTubes for the detection of 42 AR genes and related elements as well as mutation based resistance. The platform includes a ligation detection reaction of padlock probes, removal of non-ligated probes, PCR amplification, and hybridization to a customized 1.5-ml ArrayTube. It was used to screen several Salmonella Paratyphi B d-tartrate positive isolates. The identification of putative AR determinants in phenotypically susceptible isolates suggest to not only determine the resistance phenotype but to also include molecular methods like the microarray platforms developed which have been proven to be functional tools for the screening of multiple AR genes.'],\n",

Histopathological examination of lymph nodes is regarded the gold standard for establishing nodal involvement, and is the final basis for therapeutic decisions. Although this method is an extremely valid diagnostic tool, it is invasive and thus bears a risk of complications, is time-consuming, and expensive. A non-invasive diagnostic tool is warranted. In this thesis we focus on two MR imaging techniques that are hypothesized to be able to increase diagnostic accuracy of MR lymph node staging. These two methods are diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and contrast-enhanced MRI. Gadolinium-based contrast agents highlight tumour vascularity in organs and are widely used for primary tumour visualisation. We investigated the diagnostic accuracy of Gadolinium-enhanced MRI for staging lymph node metastases by means of a systematic review and meta-analysis. The meta-analysis showed that the weighted estimates of sensitivity and specificity of MRI in staging lymphatic metastases increased for the subgroup incorporating contrast enhancement in the malignancy criteria. The next three research questions being answered in this thesis are summarized using a clinical cohort including patients with gynaecological cancers in whom the pelvic lymph nodes were dissected for staging purposes. DWI added to conventional MR resulted in the additional detection of lymph nodes in all patients and these nodes were on average significant smaller than those detected by conventional MR (p'],\n",

It also explores the working mechanisms of a highly effective therapy in these patients, known as Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT). Hence, the physiology of cardiac dyssynchrony and resynchronization is explored. The technique used for this exploration is a new echocardiographic technique (speckle tracking deformation imaging), which examines th timing and amount of myocardial shortening (contraction) and stretching. Applying known physiologic aspects to improve our echocardiographic approach in the field of dyssynchrony and CRT, and inversely improving our physiologic knowledge from the results of the study, has led to the development of new indices of dyscoordination. Dyscoordination of the heart, and abnormal stretch in the septum following early shortening (septal rebound stretch), are found to have major impact on the functional consequences of cardiac dyssynchrony, but simultaneously represent the substrate to CRT. Comparing to classical dyssynchrony measures that measure only the difference in timing of motion or shortening, measuring stretch-based dyscoordination metrics as septal rebound stretch, improves our capacity to predict who exactly will respond to CRT, and who will not.'],\n",

In Chapter 2, the survival rate, Harris Hip score and radiographic features of a proximally hydroxyapatite coated titanium alloy femoral stem (Bi-Metric, Biomet) was evaluated. In conclusion, at an average follow-up of 8 years, this proximally HA-coated femoral component showed favorable clinical and radiological outcome and excellent survivorship. In Chapter 3, a systematic review was performed to determine the clinical and radiological benefit of hydroxyapatite coating compared with porous coating in uncemented primary total hip arthroplasty. In conclusion, this meta-analysis demonstrates no clinical nor radiologic benefits on the application of a hydroxyapatite coating on a femoral component in uncemented primary total hip arthroplasty. In Chapter 4, the survival rate, Harris hip score and radiographic features of a low modulus, PTFE (Proplast, Bitek) coated femoral stem was evaluated. In conclusion, the low modulus, PTFE (Proplast coated) femoral stem is associated with a poor clinical and radiological outcome. All patients should be thoroughly screened for radiographic progressive osteolysis or the occurrence of thigh pain. In Chapter 5, we hypothesised that a hemiprosthesis used without cement has a considerable high revision rate, based on aseptic loosening. A hemiprosthesis, which is designed for both cemented and uncemented fixation (Conquest, Smith&Nephew), was used. In conclusion, because of the rather high revision rate, the authors advice not to use this hemiprosthesis without cement. In Chapter 6, a proposed algorithm for surveillance and treatment of silent osteolysis is presented. When a cavitational laesion is observed, even without any clinical symptoms, a helical CT scan should be performed yearly and treatment with bisphosphonates is to be considered. In case of segmental osteolysis or progression of the cavitational laesion, extensive debridement of the osteolytic cysts, bone grafting and replacement of the polyethylene liner is the treatment of choice. In Chapter 7, the rate of polyethylene wear of a cementless acetabular component (Mallory-Head/Ringloc, Biomet) at different periods of follow-up was investigated in order to test the hypothesis than an irrecoverable deformation process (creep) was followed by an initially low, but gradually increasing wear rate. In conclusion, penetration rates of the femoral head into the polyethylene liner of the acetabular component are variable. A significant, increased rate of polyethylene wear can be seen after nine years of implantation, created by a mechanical degradation of the polyethylene surface. In Chapter 8, the femoral penetration rates were measured in inserts, sterilised in oxygen containing air (Ringloc, Biomet) and inserts, sterilised in Argon liners, during a follow-up of 8 (3 to 12) years. In conclusion, it can be stated that the in vivo penetration rate of the femoral head is significantly lower in argon-sterilised than air-sterilised UHMWPE liners. In Chapter 9, the standard posterolateral and anterolateral and minimally invasive approaches were compared in a randomized, blinded trial in 120 patients. This study reveals an improved clinical outcome of the posterolateral MIS compared with the other approaches after six weeks and one year follow-up.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['This thesis deals with the derivation of the basic reproduction number (R0) for vector-borne diseases, in the context of studying the effect of climate change on the risk of emergence diseases. Vector-borne diseases are transmitted from an infected individual to another individual by vectors, usually arthropods. Striking examples of emergence of vector-borne diseases are the introduction and spread of West Nile virus in the New World, the bluetongue epidemic in the Netherlands and surrounding countries, and the recent outbreak of chikungunya in Italy. The (re-)emergence of vector-borne diseases has often been linked to climate change, as the survival and development rates of vectors and the development rates of pathogens are often highly sensitive to temperature and other climatic factors. Within the framework of a large multidisciplinary research project, we developed epidemiological models and/or risk maps for various diseases, including West Nile virus, Lyme disease, tick-borne encephalitis, bluetongue and canine leishmaniasis. The common underlying methodology in all studies is the use of the next-generation methodology to derive an expression for the basic reproduction number (R0). R0 is defined as the average number of secondary cases caused by one typical infectious individual placed in a population consisting entirely of susceptible individuals. R0 is a measure of the success of invasion of a pathogen into a population of susceptible individuals; if an average case infects more than one other individual, a chain reaction starts and a large outbreak is possible, whereas if a case causes on average less than one new case, the introduction will fail. The next-generation matrix is a method used to overcome problems that arise from the fact that vector-borne diseases involve different types of infected individuals: at least one vector species and one host species. The dominant eigenvalue of a next-generation matrix equals R0. Here, the next-generation method is applied to various vector-borne diseases. In Chapters 2, 3 and 4, the focus is on the correct derivation of an expression of R0 and on quantifying the contribution of different transmission routes to R0; this was done for West Nile virus and for several tick-borne diseases. Another important aim of this project is the development of a methodology to construct risk maps, with which the effect of changes in climate or land use on the risk of vector-borne disease can be studied. In Chapters 5 and 6, the construction of R0 maps is demonstrated for bluetongue in The Netherlands and for canine leishmaniasis in a region in France. An R0 map gives the value of R0 for each area or point on the map, indicating the risk that an introduction in this area will lead to an outbreak. To construct these maps, all relevant biological, epidemiological and environmental information for each disease had to be brought together in a Geographical Information System. This is now possible, what is now needed is proper validation and more standardized, long-term field work and lab work to inform such systems. After all, a model is as good as the data that it based upon.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The prevalence of peripheral arterial occlusive disease in the general population is 3-10%, and increases with age. The superficial femoral artery (SFA) is most commonly affected. A new technique to desobstruct the SFA is the minimal invasive remote superficial femoral artery endarterectomy (RSFAE). The aim of this thesis was to evaluate determinants for successful RSFAE and define its role in the spectrum of treatment options for SFA occlusive disease. Current treatment modalities for peripheral arterial disease were reviewed, with a focus on restorative interventions and drug therapy to suppress neointimal hyperplasia and prevent restenosis. The patency rates of RSFAE and supragenicular bypass surgery were compared in a multicentre randomised trial including 116 patients. Median hospital stay was significantly shorter following RSFAE: 4 versus 6 days (p = 0.004). Primary patency after 3-years follow-up was 47% for RSFAE and 60% for bypass (p = 0.107). Assisted primary and secondary patency were 63% versus 69% (p = 0.406), and 69% versus 73% (p = 0.541), respectively. Subdividing between venous and prosthetic grafts shows superior results for venous bypasses. Limb salvage was 97% after RSFAE and 95% after bypass (p = 0.564). It was concluded that RSFAE is a valuable alternative, with comparable assisted primary and secondary patency rates to bypass. In a study including 17 patients the desobstructed SFA was concomitantly treated with cryoplasty, to suppress neointimal hyperplasia. Primary patency at 1-year follow-up was 74%. In 8 patients the use of a stent at the distal transection zone could be ommited; cryoplasty was sufficient to secure the transection zone. The association between alcohol intake, cardiovascular events, and atherosclerotic plaque characteristics was investigated in 224 patients undergoing femoral and in 693 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of event rate in the femoral cohort after 3 years follow-up was 35% for no alcohol and 21% for 1-10 U/wk, whereas only 10% of >10 U/wk had sustained a major cardiovascular event (p = 0.010). In the carotid cohort the event rate did not differ. Plaques of the femoral population revealed larger lipid cores and more macrophage infiltration in patients abstaining from alcohol than in patients consuming alcohol, with a dose-response relationship. In the carotid population, no relationship was observed. In multivariate analysis alcohol consumption remained independently associated with a decreased risk for major cardiovascular events (HR 0.52 [95% CI 0.33-0.81]; p = 0.004). This study shows an inverse relationship between alcohol use and major cardiovascular events after endarterectomy for peripheral arterial occlusive disease, accompanied by a more stable plaque phenotype. 90 patients post-RSFAE were studied for the occurrence of restenosis. In 57 patients (63%) a restenotic lesion was diagnosed within 1 year. Patients with longer duration of ischemic walking complaints and small vessel size revealed a higher incidence of restenosis. In multivariate analysis, age (HR 1.61 [95% CI: 1.03-2.53]; p = 0.040), duration of ischemic walking complaints (HR 1.29 [95% CI: 1.03-1.62]; p = 0.030) and lumen diameter (HR 0.37 [95% CI: 0.19-0.72]; p <0.010) were independently associated with increased risk of restenosis.'],\n",

To prevent infections with and spread of these multi-resistant nosocomial pathogens, further knowledge of the pathogenesis of E. faecium is needed. E. faecium isolates responsible for the majority of nosocomial infections and hospital outbreaks are genetically distinct from indigenous intestinal isolates. These hospital-acquired E. faecium strains acquired antibiotic resistance and virulence genes conferring an infectious phenotype to E. faecium resulting in increased fitness of E. faecium in hospitalized patients. So far, different putative virulence genes are identified that possibly contribute to the pathogenesis of E. faecium. However, our knowledge about the functions of these genes is still limited. The enterococcal surface protein gene esp is one of the identified putative virulence genes and has been implicated in initial adherence and biofilm formation. We hypothesized that Esp, because of its linkage to hospital-acquired E. faecium isolates and potential involvement in adherence and biofilm formation, is an important virulence factor for E. faecium. Therefore, the studies of this thesis mainly focused on elucidating the role of Esp in the pathogenesis of different E. faecium infections. First, by constructing an E. faecium esp mutant we demonstrated that Esp is involved in biofilm formation. Inactivation of esp resulted in abolished cell surface Esp expression, significant lower initial adherence to polystyrene, and reduced biofilm formation compared to the Esp-expressing parent strain. Subsequently, the Esp-deficient mutant and its Esp-expressing parent strain were tested in different animal models mimicking intestinal colonization, urinary tract infection (UTI), peritonitis, bacteremia, and endocarditis. In the UTI, bacteremia and endocarditis model, the Esp-deficient mutant was significantly attenuated compared to the wild-type strain indicating that Esp contributes to the pathogenesis of these infections. No differences were observed in the peritonitis and intestinal colonization model. The importance of E. faecium Esp in UTI and endocarditis probably results from the fact that these models represent biofilm-associated infections indicating a niche specific role of Esp in the pathogenesis of E. faecium infections. Esp is one of the few virulence determinants identified in E. faecium. In an attempt to identify novel putative virulence genes, the deltarho-Web model was used, a computer program that can recognize genes acquired through horizontal gene transfer by their anomalous GC-content and dinucleotide frequency. By using this model, a genomic island was identified, which appeared highly specific for hospital-acquired E. faecium isolates and putatively encodes a metabolic island involved in carbohydrate transport and metabolism providing hospital-acquired E. faecium alternative metabolic pathways of energy production. In conclusion, the work described in this thesis helped to increase our understanding in the function of Esp and identified a novel genomic island possibly implicated in E. faecium fitness. With the limited therapeutic options available, E. faecium will increasingly become a clinical challenge. Improved understanding of the virulence properties of this species will contribute to the development of novel intervention strategies, which may help us to prevent spread and infections of E. faecium in hospitals.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The general aim of this thesis was to identify factors associated with outcome after surgical attenuation of congenital portosystemic shunts (CPSS) in dogs and to clarify underlying mechanisms of postoperative recovery in this disease. Two surgical techniques used for CPSS attenuation, ligation and cellophane banding, were evaluated in 97 and 106 dogs, respectively. Cellophane banding resulted in less short-term complication and mortality rates in dogs with extrahepatic shunts. In intrahepatic shunts, cellophane banding resulted in higher complication and mortality rates than in extrahepatic CPSS. After CPSS ligation, no differences in mortality between dogs with intrahepatic or extrahepatic CPSS were found. With either technique a small proportion of dogs did not recover completely. Surgical technique is apparently not the most important factor that defines long-term outcome. After CPSS ligation, the achieved degree of closure was negatively associated with mortality. In dogs with extrahepatic shunts, both variables were correlated with the diameter of the portal vein. CPSS seems to be not only a disease of an additional abnormal vessel, but also a disease that affects the normal portal vasculature. Unexpectedly, long-term outcome did not depend on the degree of CPSS closure or on portal development at the time of surgery. Because haemorrhage was an important complication after CPSS ligation, haemostasis was evaluated in 34 dogs with a CPSS. These dogs had lower preoperative platelet counts, lower activity of clotting factors II, V, VII, X, an increased activity of factor VIII and a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time compared to healthy dogs. Immediately after CPSS attenuation, platelet counts and the activity of clotting factors I, II, V, VII, IX, X, and XI were further decreased, and prothrombin time became prolonged. In dogs with complete recovery of shunting, haemostasis was normalized after 6 weeks, in contrast to dogs with persistent shunting. In dogs with CPSS, outcome after shunt attenuation is possibly associated with hepatocyte and portal vein proliferation. Liver size and hepatic growth following surgical attenuation of a CPSS were evaluated in 10 dogs. At 2 months after surgery, median liver size had increased from 18.2 to 28.2 cm3/kg body weight. The intraoperative hepatic expression of 19 genes involved in hepatic and vascular growth and fibrosis was evaluated in 48 dogs with a CPSS in relation to postoperative outcome. Increased mRNA expression of MAT2a (methionine adenosyltransferase 2 alpha) and HGFac (hepatocyte growth factor activator) were associated with good recovery. A model including both genes predicted outcome after CPSS ligation correctly in 75% of the dogs. Low MAT2a may partially explain the poorer prognosis of intrahepatic CPSS compared to extrahepatic CPSS. To identify genes that are differently expressed between dogs with different outcome after CPSS attenuation, microarray analyses were performed in liver tissue of 46 dogs with a CPSS. Sixty-three genes were differently expressed, including several genes that may directly affect postoperative recovery. Further studies are essential to confirm and validate these findings. Clarification of factors that define postoperative outcome may help to predict treatment response and provide additional forms of treatment.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The use of genetically modified (GM) mice for biomedical research has tremendously increased since 1980’s. Housing the rapidly expanding number of mouse lines has become a problem and specific lines were even accidentally lost due to the lack of space or loss of fertility during breeding for maintenance. Cryopreservation is a strongly recommended approach to solve these problems, also from an ethical point of view. There are also technical risks by small-scale breeding, including genetic drift, microbiological or genetic contamination, disease, or large-scale disasters. The investigations presented in this thesis focus on cryopreservation of mouse ovaries to maintain the expanding populations of GM mice, and the target strains (C57BL/6, FVB, BALB/c) utilized are those commonly used as the genetic background. The major aim of the research is to develop an efficient, economic and ethically sound cryopreservation and validation protocol for archiving the mutant mouse lines. In chapter 2, a comparison is made of the currently used technologies for cryopreservation of germplasm in mice and the subsequent retrieval of these mutant lines. Detailed managerial information concerning animal use, and time and cost related to these technologies is evaluated. In chapter 3, a cryopreservation protocol for mouse ovaries using high concentrations of cryoprotectants and instrumented ultra-rapid freezing for vitrification is developed and validated by ovary transplantation and subsequent breeding. The robustness of the developed freezing protocol is investigated from various genetically modified lines with different genetic backgrounds (chapter 4). The over-time functionality of the transplanted ovaries is investigated with regard to efficiency in delivering mutant offspring. In chapter 5, the in vivo development of cryopreserved ovarian tissue is investigated by in vivo imaging after allotransplantation. The optimal donor age is also evaluated. The use of a spontaneous albino mutant of the (black) C57BL/6 as a recipient is also evaluated as a rapid method for identifying the parentage of delivered pup. In chapter 6, the application of transplantation of fresh grafts is evaluated in propagating a subfertile mutant mouse line and the reduced reproduction efficiency related to a particular genetic modification is investigated. Specific attention is focused on the origin of the abnormality. Finally, an overview of the results presented in these studies and their possible implications for future practice and researches are discussed in chapter 7. “There is really no limit to the number of mutant mouse strains that could be generated and expanded to infinity” is practically true in the filed of mouse genetics. Thus, how to manage the mouse colonies in a responsible way is an urgent issue and is an obligated responsibility of researchers. In this thesis, we present the practical information about cryopreservation of germplasm for the management of mutant mouse colonies. The successful application on cryopreservation of juvenile ovaries provides an instant solution to animal facilities that are facing space problems of housing mouse colonies and may also provide useful information to cryopreservation of human ovarian tissue, serving as a model for autotransplantation and studying graft/host interactions in a variety of models for human diseases.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Imaging mass spectrometry of polymeric materials'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Imaging mass spectrometry (MS) is a technique that makes images of molecular distributions at surfaces based on mass spectral information. At a range (typically a raster) of positions, mass spectra are measured from the surface giving a characteristic fingerprint for the material that is present at the position analyzed. By selecting a peak from the spectrum that is specific for a certain compound, a distribution map of this compound can be made. A range of analytical techniques and sample preparation techniques is available for imaging MS. The first part of this thesis focuses on these methods and techniques and gives insight in the important aspects for polymer analysis. Instrumental developments focus on the use of stigmatic ion microscopy, as described in chapters 4 and 5. By using ion optics that make a direct projection of the sample onto a position sensitive detector, an imaging MS experiment can be performed using large-diameter, unfocussed ionization beam (typically an ion or laser beam). In chapter 5, a delay line detector is introduced for ion microscopy and shown to offer both resolution and acquisition-time benefits for secondary ion mass spectrometry experiments with fullerene primary ions. Over the past century, the application of polymeric materials has increased to virtually any type of consumer products, medical devices, pharmaceuticals, adhesives and coatings. In the development and engineering of increasingly complex polymer systems, it is of great importance to understand both their spatial and molecular properties. Imaging MS is a technique that provides spatial and chemical information based on the molecular weight of materials. Because polymers are built up from a chain of monomers, which leads to a variety of polymer chain lengths, polymers show up in a mass spectrum as a collection of peaks with a slightly different mass. A single peak of this distribution can be so small that it is hardly seen in the total image spectrum, especially when only a small part of the imaged area contains polymer. Statistical analysis tools like principal component analysis find the natural correlation between these peaks. By doing so, a molecular weight distribution can be obtained and the distribution of the polymer can be visualized with sufficient image intensity. The biomedical engineering field is an important and fast-growing application field for polymeric materials. In chapter 7, a biodegradable polymer designed for drug delivery, is implanted under the capsule of a rat kidney to obtain a better understanding of the foreign-body response and polymer biodegradation. This provides molecular cartography of the polymer implant as well as the cellular signature of the implantation environment in one single experiment, showing the power of MS imaging to chemically analyze diverse samples. Cellular infiltration into the polymer is visualized based on cellular molecular signatures. Because macrophages are known to play an important role in the foreign body response, the molecular signatures are compared with macrophage standards cultured in different polarization environments. Based on this comparison, an assessment can be made on which type of macrophages localize in which region around the implantation site.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Clinicopathological and molecular aspects of cutaneous melanoma. Melanoma arises form the transformation of neural crest-derived melanocytes, the pigment cells of the skin, which reside in the basal layer of the epidermis. Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer and one of the most aggressive of all neoplasms. The incidence of cutaneous melanoma has increased rapidly during the past several decades, and continues to do so at an alarming rate. Although localized melanoma is frequently curable by surgical excision, metastatic melanoma is inherently resistant to most systemic treatments, and survival of patients with advanced disease has not improved in more than 30 years. Hence the survival of patients is based on screening, early detection, and wide resection of the primary lesion. As treatment of metastatic melanoma moves rapidly into the era of targeted therapy, there is an ever growing need to untangle the underlying genetic complexity and cellular signalling heterogeneity of this highly malignant tumor. It is widely hoped that an understanding of how genetic and signalling profiles dictate pharmacologic response will allow for the selection of optimal patient sub-populations for clinical trials. Although we have an increasingly good understanding of the genetics and biochemistry of melanoma, the mechanisms underlying their combinatorial interactions are still poorly defined and need to be fathomed to ultimately lead to more successful therapeutic strategies and evidence-based management of patients with melanoma. The goal of this thesis, therefore, is to highlight some of the issues that have arisen over the past decade. This thesis is divided into three parts. The first part describes molecular and cellular aspects of melanoma. The second part describes clinicopathological aspects of melanoma, especially studies concerning the sentinel lymph node. Part three is a discussion of the current knowledge of melanoma and future perspectives in molecular and clinical melanoma research. The overall conclusions we can draw from the research described in this thesis are: 1) Melanoma is a complex tissue resulting from disrupted skin homeostasis, rather than putting the focus on the melanoma cell, and the genes within it, alone. 2) During transformation and progression of melanocytes to melanoma cells, there are reciprocal and conspirational interactions between the neoplastic cells and the adjacent stromal cells. Skin cells within the cancerous tissue are not idle bystanders, but rather active participants that shape the aggressive features of this neoplasm. 3) Careful clinical observations and what they teach us about the biology of melanoma still have a place in modern medicine, even in the molecular age. 4) Patients with positive sentinel lymph nodes are a heterogeneous group; not all sentinel node-positive patients have necessarily a poor prognosis. 5) Sentinel lymph node tumor load, i.e. depth of invasive penetration, or metastatic size, can be used to predict the absence of additional metastatic lymph nodes in melanoma patients. 6) Based on low sentinel tumor load and limited Breslow thickness of the primary tumor, a subgroup of melanoma patients with a positive sentinel node can be identified who will not significantly benefit from completion lymph node dissection. 7) Selective sentinel node guided lymph node dissection is potentially curative for a subset of patients. 8) Even if selective sentinel lymph node guided lymph node dissection in and by itself should not improve survival, it is of great prognostic value and should be continued until another, less invasive staging procedure with similar predictive value is available.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Genetics of Cognitive Endophenotypes in Schizophrenia : a Family-Based Study'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Schizophrenia is a highly heritable, though complex disease; multiple genes and environmental factors influence its development. Most of these genes have small effects on schizophrenia. Therefore, the localization and identification of genes for schizophrenia has been difficult. An alternative method is to measure characteristics related to schizophrenia that are less complex phenomena, so-called endophenotypes. If endophenotypes are less complex clinically and genetically than schizophrenia itself, it may be easier to find the underlying genes. Because of the link between endophenotype and schizophrenia, a gene linked to an endophenotype may also be involved in schizophrenia. The main objective of these studies was to unravel the genetic characteristics of promising endophenotypes for schizophrenia and to apply these in genetic research. We investigated the heritable characteristics of 13 candidate endophenotypes for schizophrenia, including neuropsychological, psychophysiological, and personality traits, in 25 multigenerational families (180 subjects) with multiple members affected with schizophrenia. Contrary to expectations, only five of 13 measures showed moderate within-family correlations and equivalent heritability estimates between 0.37 and 0.54: sensorimotor gating, openness, verbal fluency, early visual perception, and spatial working memory. Notably, several other popular candidate endophenotypes showed low familial correlations, including verbal memory, neuroticism, and P50. Segregation analysis showed that a simple mode of transmission fitted best to just two endophenotypes: openness and sensorimotor gating. In the second study, we quantified potential overlapping genetic and environmental contributions among the heritable endophenotypes for schizophrenia. The results suggested that intelligence strongly overlaps genetically with a known cognitive endophenotype for schizophrenia, i.e., spatial working memory. Intelligence may thus be a promising endophenotype for genetic research in schizophrenia, even though the underlying genetic mechanism may still be complex. Other endophenotypes, i.e., sensorimotor gating and openness, appeared to represent separate genetic entities. In the third study, we performed a genome-wide linkage scan using the heritable endophenotypes in a subset of the families. The linkage results were combined with information about biological functions of positional candidate genes and independent data of gene expression in brain tissue of schizophrenia patients, guiding us towards the NTRK3 gene as a susceptibility gene for schizophrenia. In the fourth study, we searched for heritable oscillatory phenotypes, EEG, to be used in linkage analysis. Theta activity at occipital sites appeared to be the most heritable of the measured frequency bands. Linkage peaks were observed with suggestive evidence, including the locus for DTNBP1. Contrary to expectations, EEG was not more powerful than previously investigated cognitive endophenotypes in the same linkage sample. Summarizing, the results described in this thesis suggest that: i) not all candidate endophenotypes are heritable; ii) both shared and distinct genetic contributions underlie these heritable endophenotypes; iii) the studied heritable endophenotypes are linked with suggestive evidence to a number of genetic loci; iv) and NTRK3 is a susceptibility gene for schizophrenia. These studies are an example of how phenotype analysis in pedigrees, linkage mapping, gene expression data in brain tissue, and association testing in cases and controls can be used jointly in order to study the genetic basis for complex neuropsychiatric traits.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['With the emergence of novel, rationally designed anti-cancer drugs there is also a need for novel endpoints when evaluating these drugs in clinical trials. The combined PET/CT scanner can be a very useful tool in the process of drug development in several ways, which is described in the first chapter of this thesis. PET/CT can be used for patient selection, for measuring the early response to treatment, and for determining the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of novel anti-cancer drugs. \\r\\nThe next chapter describes the novel drug class of the aurora kinase inhibitors. First, the clinical experience with inhibitors of aurora kinase A, B, or both is reviewed. Following this review article, a phase I study with one of these agents, AZD1152, is described. In the subsequent chapters of this thesis, several phase I trials are described with a variety of novel anti-cancer drugs, with various mechanisms of action. These agents include: AZD5438, an inhibitor of cyclin dependent kinases; olaparib (AZD2281), a PARP inhibitor; E7080, an angiogenesis inhibitor; and PF00299804, an inhibitor of HER-1, HER-2, and HER-4 receptor tyrosine kinases. Also, several phase I studies combining targeted anti-cancer drugs with conventional chemotherapy are described. The main goal for all of the described phase I trials in this thesis was to determine the maximum tolerable dose (MTD), dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), and pharmacokinetics of the investigational drugs. However, increasingly important in these studies are pharmacodynamic endpoints, which can give early indications of the activity of the investigational drugs. Several of the studies in this thesis have successfully implemented pharmacodynamic assays, with the olaparib phase I trial as best example. In this study, target inhibition (reduced activity of the target enzyme poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase) was demonstrated in white blood cells as well as in tumor cells from patients following treatment with olaparib. One of the important conclusions from these results was that there is no need to dose the patients at the MTD since maximal target inhibition is already obtained with lower doses of olaparib. \\r\\nSeveral of the investigational anti-cancer drugs described in this thesis showed promising activity. Olaparib, for instance, appeared very effective in patients with BRCA deficient breast and ovarian cancer (over half of the patients with BRCA deficient tumors derived clinical benefit from treatment with olaparib). In the phase I trial with E7080, treatment with the angiogenesis inhibitor led to reductions in tumor volume in all patients with melanoma who entered the study. Finally, several partial responses were observed in patients with non-small cell lung cancer following treatment with the pan-HER inhibitor PF00299804.\\r\\nIn conclusion, this thesis describes phase I studies with novel anti-cancer agents. Several of the described compounds are now under evaluation in phase II and phase III studies. Future studies with targeted agents should focus more on pharmacodynamic endpoints, and patients for future phase I studies should be included based on their tumor characteristics. PET/CT might be a helpful tool for both these purposes.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Immunological markers of cell activation in sarcoidosis'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Sarcoidosis is a systemic disease of unknown cause, which is characterized by the presence of noncaseating granulomas in one or multiple organs. Most clinical manifestations of sarcoidosis are secondary to the direct effect of the accumulation of activated immune cells in involved tissues, notably T cells and macrophages. The purpose of this thesis was to evaluate the usefulness of markers of immune cell activation in pulmonary sarcoidosis. Furthermore, genes encoding proteins related to cell activation were investigated for their influence on disease susceptibility or disease course. Sarcoidosis is likely to be a genetically complex disease that involves a combination of genetic loci conferring disease predisposition or phenotypic variation of disease manifestation. The results in this thesis describe two novel susceptibility genes for sarcoidosis, the ITGAE gene and the IL7R gene. ITGAE encodes the alpha chain for the integrin alphaEbeta7, a protein which accounts for the interaction between T cells and epithelial cells. A specific genotype of a promoter single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) correlated with higher percentages of CD103+CD4+ lymphocytes in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of sarcoidosis patients and in in vitro cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Furthermore, this genotype was associated with fibrosis formation on chest x-ray after minimal 4 years follow-up. These chronic activated effector T cells may be important as first line of defense but might also be harmful to an already compromised epithelium. IL7Ralpha is a functional key marker of the early heterogeneity observed in effector T cells. A functional SNP in the IL7R gene was associated with the development of sarcoidosis. Altered IL-7 signaling may contribute to reduced initial immune activation, leading to persistence of the antigen and subsequent development of sarcoid granuloma. The results described in this thesis support the use of cell activation markers as sarcoidosis disease parameters, in addition to existing parameters including disease marker levels in serum, evolution of chest x-ray, and lung function data. Peripheral blood CD69+VLA-1+ monocytes and CD8+CD28null lymphocytes may be promising new biomarkers for respectively disease activity and disease severity. In addition, in BALF of sarcoidosis patients, increased percentages of CD103 positive cells at time of diagnosis showed prognostic value for development of parenchymal infiltrates at pulmonary disease outcome independent of chest radiography at presentation. Finally, the BALF CD103+CD4+/CD4+ ratio, combined with a relative BAL/PB CD4+/CD8+ ratio, discriminated pulmonary sarcoidosis from other interstitial lung diseases. Due to the increased possibilities to characterize the cellular and protein composition of BALF, the normal values of these novel parameters are mostly lacking for historical controls. We therefore set out to determine the normal values for cellular subsets and a broad range of protein biomarkers in a group of healthy subjects who underwent bronchoalveolar lavage. This enabled us to define unique blood and corresponding lung control values of the experimental parameters described in the different chapters.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Vaccination provides the best form of protection against seasonal and pandemic influenza. Intranasal (i.n.) vaccination against influenza poses several advantages to an intramuscular injection, such as simple, noninvasive administration and the potential induction of mucosal immune responses in addition to systemic ones. The aim of in this thesis is the rational design of an inactivated i.n. influenza vaccine. Initially, four commonly used, nonadjuvanted influenza vaccines were tested to determine the optimal antigen formulation for i.n. administration. From these studies, whole inactivated virus (WIV) was selected as the best candidate for further optimization as an i.n. inactivated influenza vaccine. Next, WIV was formulated with N,N,N-trimethylchitosan (TMC), a water-soluble, cationic, mucoadhesive polymer. The addition of TMC, which is partially bound to the WIV particles and partially present in solution, strongly enhanced the immunogenicity of the vaccines and induced complete protection after i.n. vaccination in mice. Additionally, the relationship between structure and adjuvanticity of TMC structural variants in an i.n. WIV-based vaccine was investigated. Furthermore, the influence of TMC on the nasal residence time, antigen distribution in the nasal cavity and local toxicity was assessed. The increased adjuvanticity of TMC-WIV vaccines could not be explained by a prolonged nasal residence time, but likely the interaction between WIV and the mucosal surfaces is enhanced by formulation with TMC. Minimal local toxicity was observed. Next, a study was performed to clarify why reacetylated TMC(TMCRA)did not work as an adjuvant, in contrast to all other TMC structural variants. It appeared that TMCRA did not enhance the antigen uptake by epithelial cells as much as the other TMCs. Interestingly, initial studies on dendritic cells (DCs) suggest that TMCRA does act as an immunostimulant on human DCs but not as pronounced on murine DCs. Finally, the colloidal stability of these TMC-WIV vaccines was studied and revealed that stable colloidal formulations of positively charged, TMC-coated WIV particles can be obtained with all TMC variants. However, the TMC:WIV w/w ratio; the salt concentration and the type of TMC influence the stability of the formed TMC-WIV formulations. Freeze drying these formulations seems feasible for further enhancement of the colloidal stability. Altogether, the research in this thesis resulted in the rational design of an i.n. influenza vaccine, based on WIV with TMC as an adjuvant, that shows promising results for further development.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Insulin resistance in platelets and monocytes'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Patients with type 2 diabetes have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and suffer from thrombotic complications. The aim of the studies presented in this thesis is to elucidate the cause of the prothrombotic situation in type 2 diabetes patients. The studies were focused on platelets and monocytes, two important cell types involved in thrombosis. Normally, insulin inhibits platelets by interfering with the suppression of cAMP, a potent intracellular inhibitor of aggregation and secretion. In type 2 diabetes, this interference is much reduced and platelets show faster aggregation, secretion of granule content, increased synthesis of thromboxane A2 and generation of a procoagulant surface than controls. Obesity is a major risk factor of insulin resistance. Blood from obese individuals contains elevated levels of adipokines, cytokines and hormones derived from adipocytes and macrophages. We identified four adipokines that induce insulin resistance in megakaryocytes, the cells that produce platelets. Short contact with resistin, leptin, PAI-1 and RBP4 but not with visfatin, IL-6 and TNF-alpha aborts insulin signaling through IRS-1 and is reversible; prolonged incubation causes IRS-1 degradation and is irreversible. Plasma samples from obese men mimick the effect of megakaryocyte-disturbing adipokines. Platelets from type 2 diabetic patients are insulin-resistant and have reduced expression of IRS-1. These results suggest that increased release of resistin, leptin, PAI-1 and RBP4 by adipocytes causes synthesis of insulin-resistant platelets by megakaryocytes. Coagulation is initiated by Tissue Factor (TF), which is produced in activated platelets and monocytes. We investigated whether platelets and monocytes are responsive to insulin and if so, whether insulin resistance affects TF production in platelets and monocytes. Recent findings suggest a new source for TF expression. The anucleate platelet has long been considered incapable of synthesizing proteins, but the presence of a splicing machinery together with pre-mRNAs for a number of proteins including TF make them a source for TF synthesis. In healthy individuals, TF synthesis is inhibited by insulin but in patients with type 2 diabetes inhibition is impaired. This leads to the novel finding that platelets from type 2 diabetes patients produce more TF than platelets from matched controls. TF is predominantly produced in activated monocytes. We investigated whether insulin interferes with TF expression in monocytes and monocytic THP-1 cells. We show that insulin concentrations in the physiological range interfere with cAMP suppression and TF formation in cells and monocytes-derived microparticles. The inhibition of TF synthesis in monocytes by insulin has disappeared in type 2 diabetes patients. The cause is impaired formation of an insulin receptor – Gi alpha 2 complex, which in normal monocytes interferes with the Gi mediated suppression of cAMP. Together with the disappearance of suppression of platelet functions, the upregulated TF synthesis might contribute to the atherothrombotic complications observed in type 2 diabetes patients. The results in this study show that platelets and monocytes from type 2 diabetes patients are insulin-resistant, which might explain the prothrombotic situation in these patients. Type 2 diabetes patients have hyperactive platelets and increased levels of TF expressed by platelets and monocytes compared to healthy controls.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['In the fourth month of fetal development, there is a maximum of about 6-7 million follicles present in the ovaries. Thereafter, follicle numbers decline slowly. The progressive loss of quality and quantity of oocytes is called ovarian ageing. During the process of ovarian ageing, different phases can be discerned with about 10 year intervals: optimal fecundity, infertility, sterility and menopause. Consequently, if menopause occurs early in life, a woman’s fecundity has been compromised decades before. Therefore, accurate prediction of the rate of ovarian ageing and the associated fecundity is desirable. Estimation of ovarian reserve is possible by a wide array of endocrine, ultrasound and genetic tests currently available. This thesis discusses the value of genetic, vascular and other factors in the prediction of menopause and the clinical applicability of ovarian reserve tests is evaluated. The results of the various studies in this thesis underline the complexity of ovarian ageing and the difficulties that prediction of menopause entails. Based on its relationship with age and the antral follicle count, its cycle stability and longitudinal decline with age, anti-Mllerian Hormone (AMH) seems currently the best ovarian reserve test to predict age at menopause. Future longitudinal studies should confirm its accuracy and clinical applicability. The plausibility of vascular factors determining age at menopause is based primarily on indirect evidence. Since there is no consensus about the definition and mode of measurement of vascular ageing, future research should be interpreted cautiously. Diverse ovarian reserve tests are integrated in fertility work-up worldwide, although their capacity to predict pregnancy is poor. Moreover, current research involving ovarian reserve tests often ignores female age and past treatment outcomes as predictive factors of pregnancy. Identification of women with an adequate prognosis seems possible based on strict test cut-offs. Future research should focus on improving the accuracy of prediction models, possibly by incorporating AMH, familial age at menopause and cycle regularity into these models. Currently, there is no single ovarian reserve test able to predict age at menopause with enough certainty in individual women. Future research should focus on combining various ovarian reserve tests to improve the predictive accuracy.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Summary Chapter 1 addresses general aspects of neurodevelopmental disorders and gives an outline of this thesis. Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD), are an important health care problem with a prevalence of 2-3% in the general population. The widespread etiological causes for NDD comprise exogenic factors (teratogens, infections and trauma) and genetic causes (including metabolic diseases). The complicated diagnostic work-up in NDD is described. Chapter 2 describes the importance of metabolic investigations in the diagnostic pathway of NDD. We studied the yield of metabolic investigations in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders of unknown origin and found a yield of 2.8 % despite performed metabolic investigations before referral. As seen in this study, additional metabolic investigations can even extend the metabolic yield in an already screened population. Chapter 3 describes the findings of MRI scans in patients with unexplained NDD. In 30.7 % of the patients abnormal MRI scans were observed and in 5.4 % the MRI scans lead to an etiologic diagnosis. This study shows in a large population of patients with NDD that neurological findings are indicative for having an abnormal or diagnostic MRI. In our specialised centre 5.4 % of the patients had a diagnostic MRI scan, despite initial metabolic and genetic investigations before referral. This study confirms for the first time in a large population of patients with unexplained NDD, the value of an MRI scan of the brain, in the diagnostic work-up for NDD. Chapter 4 describes the yield of MRI imaging in patients with NDD in association with dysmorphic features. Dysmorphic features could indicate an altered embryonic, foetal or post-natal development, likely to increase the chance of abnormal developmental patterning of the brain. This study showed a higher number of craniofacial dysmorphic features in patients with NDD increasing the yield of brain abnormalities of those patients. This might aid the search for an etiological diagnosis. In chapter 5 the frequency of specific pregnancy and delivery features in children with NDD was compared with the frequency of pregnancy and delivery features in children of the general Dutch population. The study established associations between NDD and gestational diabetes, polyhydramnion, postterm pregnancy, Low Birth Weight (LBW'],\n",

Differentiation between PLS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and sporadic presentation of hereditary spastic paraparesis (HSP) is important for prognostication and genetic counseling of patients, but may be problematic. We studied a large cohort of Dutch patients with an sporadic adult-onset UMN syndrome in a 3-year prospective study. Some of our findings support the view that PLS may be a variant of ALS: we observed patients who converted from PLS to ALS, patients who had PLS as a phenotypic manifestation of familial ALS, and a patient who had clinical PLS up to the time of death, but who at autopsy showed ALS pathology. On the other hand, many patients retained a phenotype similar to HSP (UMN signs only in the legs, or at most also in the arms). In addition, we could genetically confirm the diagnosis of HSP in a proportion of the included patients. We found that spastin gene (SPG4) and paraplegin gene (SPG7) mutations are frequent cause of patients with UMN symptoms restricted to the legs (both in around 12% of the patients), but mutations were not found in patients with symptoms in the bulbar region (typical PLS phenotype). Differentiating (sporadic) HSP from PLS based on other clinical characteristics was unreliable and therefore depends on genetic testing. Based on our observations and recent studies by other groups, we designed new diagnostic criteria for PLS, incorporating levels of certainty of diagnosis of PLS instead of HSP based on the distribution of UMN symptoms over body region. Our 3-year prospective study validated that classifying patients with a disease duration ?4 years is able to differentiate PLS from HSP in levels of certainty: typical PLS (UMN signs in at least the bulbar region), probable PLS (UMN signs in arms and legs), and possible PLS (UMN signs only in the legs).

       "  'Description': ['Rare diseases have a prevalence of lower than 5 in 10,000 inhabitants and are life-threatening or chronically debilitating. It is estimated that worldwide more than 5000 rare diseases exist, which account for over 55 million patients in the EU and the US together. However, the development of drugs for rare diseases, so called orphan drugs has not been an area of high priority for the pharmaceutical industry so far. Therefore, dedicated orphan drug legislation has been introduced that aims to stimulate the development of these high medical need products. This thesis identifies strategies for enhancing the development and marketing of orphan drugs. In the first chapter, bottlenecks and opportunities for translating biomedical research on rare diseases into early orphan drug development were studied. This chapter highlighted the importance of basic biomedical research for orphan drug development. Moreover, the studies determined the importance of strong pharmaceutical innovation in general, including patent applications, R&D expenditure and the existence of small and medium enterprises in the pharmaceutical industry, for the successful translation of biomedical research into orphan drug development. The second chapter focussed on characteristics of orphan drugs associated with a positive or negative outcome of the marketing authorisation application (by the FDA or EMEA). First, sponsors with prior experience in (orphan) drug development were more likely to develop another orphan drug. Orphan drugs based on existing molecules had also more chance to get market approval. Second, the choice of the target population for the orphan drug and the choice of the primary endpoint in the pivotal clinical trial was determined to be associated with the outcome of the regulatory assessment. Finally, a higher level of interaction between sponsors and regulators was shown to be positively associated with successful market authorisation. The third chapter of the thesis described the challenges of orphan drugs after approval. As a result of differences in healthcare systems and other reasons, including the sometimes-high prices of orphan drugs, not all orphan drugs are available to the patients throughout the EU. In the thesis, the use of orphan drugs is compared to other centrally authorised drugs in the EU and this appeared not to be significantly different. Second, due to the limited clinical experience with orphan drugs before approval, the risk for unexpected adverse events of orphan drugs may be higher than for other drugs. We reveal that the number of written safety warnings and black box warnings for orphan drugs is not significantly different from that for other drugs.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Imaging of perfusion of the myocardium with nuclear cardiac imaging is an uncontested technique for diagnostic as well as prognostic purposes in patients with chest pain and a normal activation pattern of the heart. However, when the activation pattern of the heart is abnormal as happens with intraventricular conduction disorders or artificial cardiac pacing, the value of this technique becomes disputable. This shortcoming is predominantly caused by the presence of perfusion defects not caused by coronary artery disease. These false positive perfusion defects diminish the diagnostic and prognostic value of nuclear imaging in patients with chest pain and abnormal activation who are studied in this thesis. We showed that these false positive defects meet specific diagnostic criteria. In addition it was demonstrated that wall motion abnormalities due to abnormal activation are strongly related to perfusion defects. The limited resolution of the nuclear camera for a movi ng organ is presumably the cause of these false positive defects. We strengthened this assumption by showing a normal myocardial blood-flow in the walls where false positive perfusion are found. The abnormal activation related defects (AARD) follow a typical pattern. We defined a triad to recognize these AARD and demonstrated that the prognosis of patients with AARD compares well those patients with a completely normal perfusion with abnormal activation of the heart. By recognizing these AARD in patients with chest pain it is possible to distinguish patients with perfusion defects that are at a low risk for future cardiac events from those with perfusion defects at high risk for future cardiac events. The results of this thesis allow to identify patients with chest pain and abnormal left ventricular activation pattern but are nevertheless at a low cardiac risk. This category has a prognosis that merits a watchful waiting strategy, and invasive, expensive diagnostic procedures can be av oided. This strategy prevents patient burden and complication risk. However patients with chest pain and abnormal activation of the heart with a high risk estimated by nuclear imaging, require further diagnostic work up often followed by surgical coronary revascularization or Dotter procedures. The results of these cardiac nuclear studies are of relevance for patient care in terms of improved management and saving of costs.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The Kirschner (K-) wire was first introduced in 1909 by Martin Kirschner. This is a thin unthreaded wire of surgical steel with a diameter of up to three millimeters and a selection of different tips. The use of K-wires is often promoted as a simple technique because of its easy placement, cost-effectiveness and safety. The most important advantage of K-wires is the ability for percutaneous placement and is especially prevalent in hand surgery as the bones of the hand have suitable access for wire placement. The quality of K-wire fixation after drilling depends on several factors like drilling speed, insertion time and force, irrigation, K-wire diameter and tip configuration. These factors can lead to temperature elevation and subsequent disappearance of osteocytes in the immediate surrounding of the K-wire. In order to find out if hammering K-wires could prevent or lessen the amount of damage to the bone caused by high speed drilling, we analysed the insertion time, degree of temperature development, degree of fixation, histology, the influence of irrigation and the effect of K-wires with different tips. It became clear that there exists a positive correlation between the distance of the empty osteocyte lacunae and the drilling time. In daily practice this means the longer the drilling time, the longer the distance of empty osteocytes surrounding the pin track, i.e. the more osteonecrosis resulting in preterm loosening and pin track infections. We further found that reduced drilling times may prevent the disappearance of osteocytes in the absence of cooling. The use of the pneumatic hammer however prevents for thermal related damage i.e. osteonecrosis without the use of irrigation due to the shorter insertion time and lower temperature elevation compared to the high speed drill. This was confirmed by the osteocytes which were still in the lacunae surrounding the pin track after hammering K-wires. Finally we showed that the fixation of hammered K-wires is at least as good as the drilled ones, especially concerning the hammered sharp trocar tip K-wires. Despite the promising results mentioned above, there does not exist a perfect hammering device at the present time. The pneumatic hammering devices we used in our experimental setting were effective but had some serious disadvantages, like microfractures in the cortex. In order to use the pneumatic hammer in a clinical setting the device has to be further improved and adapted. In conclusion, the pneumatic hammer seems to be an effective K-wire insertion technique. The in vitro and in vivo results we described are promising because they are at least equal and often better compared to drilling concerning insertion time, survival of the osteocytes, heat generation and fixation. However, the golden standard for insertion of K-wires at this moment is still the high speed drill. But more extensive research and the development of a perfect hammering device might probably change the second century of K-wire insertion in the near future.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Medical care in general and paediatric intensive care specifically have greatly advanced over the years. This has resulted in a decrease in mortality over time for a large number of diseases. However, for several diseases there still is considerable uncertainty about the outcome of intensive care treatment. This holds true especially for rarely occurring diseases, or for diseases which traditionally were considered to have an unfavourable outcome. The studies described in this thesis assessed epidemiological characteristics, clinical courses and ICU mortality rates for several of such conditions. In the first study we retrospectively examined outcomes of mechanical ventilation in patients with cystic fibrosis over a period of 15 years. Results revealed that children nowadays have a good prognosis. Their long-term outcome seems identical to unventilated controls. Adult cystic fibrosis patients still have high ICU mortality rates, especially when they have acute on chronic respiratory failure. For children requiring mechanical ventilation after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, there is a widely held impression that ICU mortality has clearly decreased over time. However, we could not confirm this with a meta-analysis of available literature (study 2). Since recent data in this group of patients were scarce, we subsequently assessed outcome in the 35 most recently ventilated children after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation from our own department (study 3). We found an improvement of ICU survival and in survival six months after discharge from ICU. Children with severe neurological impairment often have respiratory problems. The decision to initiate or withhold mechanical ventilation in this population requires careful consideration. Unfortunately, literature does not provide any evidence to make this decision. In the fourth study we showed that in our department, uneventful survival in these children was low. Repeated, prolonged and complicated admission to ICU was often required. However, outcome was not uniformly dismal, which underscores the need for further research. In the fifth study we reviewed the outcomes for 239 consecutive patients with meningococcal disease treated in our ICU. Over time, children were more severely ill on admission. Mortality corrected for severity of disease decreased in the same time period, suggesting improvements in ICU care. More fluids were given over time and vaso-active drugs were started earlier in the course of the disease. Yet, the increase in survival could not be explained by this more aggressive resuscitation of shock. In the sixth study we reviewed 34 episodes of refractory status epilepticus (RSE) treated in our ICU. Thiopental was effective in most patients, but there were serious side-effects. Propofol was used according to a strict protocol. It was effective in most patients, so that thiopental was not needed. Side-effects were infrequent, of minor severity and fully reversible. We suggest the use of propofol before thiopental. Overall it can be concluded that advancements in intensive care have resulted in increased survival over time, but many questions remain. Future research in these complex groups of patients would be helped with prospectively collected databases by a group of dedicated ICUs.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the most common diseases affecting people throughout the world and second only to cancer as the most frequent cause of death in the Netherlands. Early detection of asymptomatic individuals at high risk of developing CVD events is an important goal since modification of risk and lifestyle factors (hypercholesterolaemia, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, diet, exercise) in these patients will reduce their risk of future fatal or nonfatal CVD events (coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, arterial aneurysms or peripheral arterial occlusive disease). The main aim of this thesis was to investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of two different strategies to use computed tomography (CT) imaging as a tool to detect asymptomatic individuals at high risk of CVD events. First, we investigated the reproducibility and prognostic value of scoring coronary (CAC) and aortic calcifications (TAC) in routinely obtianed chest CT examinations in a clinical care population (n=14,366). We found that scoring these subclinical calcifications on semi-quantitative scale was reproducible with a weighted kappa value for inter-observer variability of 0.54-0.89. A follow-up study showed that these subclinical disease markers are strong predictors of incident CVD events in a routine clinical care population. Compared with subjects with no calcium, the adjusted risk for a CVD event was 3.7 times higher (95% CI, 2.7-5.2) among patients with severe coronary calcification (CAC score ? 6) and 2.7 times higher (95% CI, 2.0-3.7) among patients with severe aortic calcification (TAC score ? 5). These results demonstrate the feasibility of extracting prognostic information from diagnostic imaging. Second, we investigated whether scoring CAC/TAC as part of a lung cancer screening study with a low-dose, non-gated chest CT protocol could benefit patients. Reproducibility was assessed. Interscan agreement of classifying participants into the same CAC score-based risk category was good (? = 0.67). Only 6 participants (1%) were classified more than 1 risk category apart on consecutive CT scans. Next, we demonstrated that adding CAC scoring to a prediction model consiting of tradtional CVD risk factors would reclassify 1 in 3 participants at intermediate risk into higher or lower risk categories. By investigating which of the participants were already receiving preventive drug therapy, we calculated that 1 in 12 participants screened could benefit from optimized targeting of preventive risk factor treatment by applying this strategy. Finally, we showed that even in this heavy smoking population (mean numver of pack-years >40yr), quitting smoking will reduce risk of CVD events. Compared with current smokers, the HR for CVD events for former smokers was 0.65 (95% CI 0.42-0.99). We conclude that using vascular calcifications as predictors of future CVD events in either patients undergoing routine diagnostic chest CT or participants of a low-dose CT lung cancer screening trial is feasible and effective. Both examples constitute an extension of existing practices and try to define new strategies for the early detection of CVD in order to optimize primary preventive efforts of reducing the number of incident fatal and nonfatal CVD events.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Percutaneous coronary interventions are recognized techniques to treat coronary artery disease. However, despite the progress in the development of materials and techniques, several limitations affect the acute and long-term performance of these procedures. In particular, there are three mayor drawbacks: restenosis, thrombosis and technical feasibility of the procedure. The recent introduction of drug-eluting stents has been a major step forward in reducing restenosis. The pivotal randomized trials versus bare metal stents, performed in selected patients and lesions, showed a dramatic reduction in restenosis rate with extremely low rates in the drug-eluting stent group. However, a potential issue related to the possibly increased incidence of stent thrombosis with these new devices appeared. Our thesis had two major aims: 1) to assess the values and drawbacks of first-generation drug-eluting stents (eluting sirolimus or paclitaxel) when used in patients and lesions not included in the pivotal trials, and 2) to assess new drug-eluting stents and stents specifically dedicated for selected anatomies. We showed in different subsets of patients and lesions that first-generation drug-eluting stents achieve good results also in off-label indications, such as in left main coronary artery disease, in saphenous vein graft disease, and in “real-life” “daily-practice” unselected patients. However, restenosis appeared still to be an issue specifically in the treatment of distal left main disease, in diabetic patients, and in patients in whom multiple lesions or long stents were placed. Moreover, in the treatment of saphenous vein graft disease, we showed an alarming increase in mortality at long-term follow-up with drug-eluting stents as compared to bare metal stents, finding mainly driven by potential thrombotic events occurring after placement of these new devices. As we showed that first-generation drug eluting stents were not free from complications, the search for new drugs and new stent designs appeared crucial in order to further improve the outcomes of percutaneous coronary interventions. First, we focused our research on a new anti-restenotic drug, pimecrolimus, that provided promising results in further reducing restenosis in animal models. We tested this new drug directly loaded onto a stent. However, pimecrolimus-eluting stents failed to fulfill in humans its preclinical promises as anti-restenotic drug. Finally, we focused on two novel self-expanding drug-eluting nitinol stents, one eluting biolimus and designed for bifurcation lesions, the other eluting sirolimus, designed for small vessels and directly loaded into a 0.014 inches coronary guidewire. The first stent showed to be highly deployable and it provided very interesting results with low angiographic and clinical restenosis rates in a difficult setting such as the one of bifurcations. We then described the case of a patient with a lesion in a small vessel, successfully treated with the stent directly loaded into the coronary guidewire. This stent with its extremely low-profile (the same as a routine coronary wire) has the potential to become a major step forward in tackling complex anatomies with extremely tortuous vessels and lesions located in the distal vasculature, where other “traditional” stents would not be able to be tracked.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Comitology committees deal with the implementation of European policies. In total, about two-thirds of all implementation measures first passes through comitology. This makes comitology responsible for about half of all European directives, regulations and decisions. Several hundreds of these committees exist, and their competences range from juridical aspects of cableways to preventing animal diseases. They are composed of civil servants from all member states who are specialized in the topics under discussion. Expertise, thus, plays a prominent role. Who, if anyone, monitors and assesses their performance? To what extent are the current accountability regimes and practices in this area of EU governance appropriate? Past research related to this question exclusively focused at the formal arrangements between comitology and the European Parliament or the Court of Justice. It shows that accountability is on the increase, but still quite poorly developed. This thesis argues that accountability at the European level alone does not suffice for multi-level governance instruments like comitology. Rather, accountability needs to be assured at both the European and the national levels. But evidence from the national level is not available for comitology. This thesis therefore uses new data collected at the national level. The evidence has been collected by means of a survey to all Dutch and Danish committee participants and their immediate superiors, as well as by interviews with twenty-eight of them, supplemented by five observations of committee meetings in Brussels. The analysis shows that the superiors of the committee participants are quite much guided by what comes to their desks. The amount of transmitted information depends on the degree of expertise of both the policy expert and his superior, and also on the degree of autonomy that the superior leaves to the committee participant. The superiors furthermore read selectively as they have to cope with a high workload themselves. This also translates itself in the frequency of discussions: if no written feedback is given about a committee meeting, the odds that past behaviour is being discussed go down. Ill-informed superiors are thus left asleep. But sometimes, superiors do see it is time for action and it appears that mostly they are able to sanction or reward the behaviour of their subordinates. That, however, is only the final step of a process of accountability; in terms of information transfer and frequency of debates cases differ a lot more. Accountability at the national level, thus, appears supply-driven instead of demand-driven: the initiative for sending information lies with the committee participant. This is situation is problematic, especially for comitology. Because of its multi-level character, no single entity can justifiably be held responsible for its outcomes. The Commission depends on the member states and vice versa, and within the member states the national parliaments are supposed to scrutinize their respective governments.'],\n",

The studies in the first part have addressed the results of antireflux surgery after previous endoscopic or surgical procedures performed for refractory gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. It was previously shown that primary antireflux surgery fails in 10-15% of patients in the long run and, although conservative treatment is adequate in the majority of patients, surgical reintervention is necessary in 3-6%. Symptomatic and objective outcomes of surgical reintervention for failed antireflux surgery are, with a success rate of 70-80%, substantially lower than those of primary surgery, as was shown in a cohort study and a systematic review of the literature in this thesis. Herein, risk factors for renewed failure appeared to be difficult to identify. Additionally, redo antireflux surgery is accompanied with relative high morbidity and even mortality. An anatomical explanation for failure of the previous surgical antireflux procedure, including wrap disruption, telescoping (ie, cephalad migration of the gastro-oesophageal junction through the wrap), intrathoracic wrap migration, or para-oesophageal hiatal herniation (ie, intrathoracic migration of a part of the stomach with the wrap in its normal subdiaphragmatic position), was found during redo surgery in 90% of patients. Compared to primary surgical procedures, antireflux surgery after a previous endoluminal EsophyX fundoplication, recently introduced to offer an alternative for life-long use of antisecretory drugs and to avoid prolonged recuperation of antireflux surgery, may be accompanied with a higher risk of intraoperative gastric injury and postoperative troublesome dysphagia. However, a previous endoluminal EsophyX fundoplication should, at this stage, not be considered an additional risk factor in antireflux surgery, as it does not influence the outcome with regard to reflux control. The second part of this thesis has focused on the surgical treatment of large hiatal hernias. Because of the documented advantages over the open repair, including less complications, less postoperative pain, and shorter hospital stay, the laparoscopic repair is the preferred approach in the surgical treatment of large hiatal hernias. It was shown in this thesis that the long-term symptomatic outcome of laparoscopic large hiatal hernia repair is satisfactory in 90% of patients. A substantial number of patients, however, has anatomical recurrence (30%). A difference in symptomatic outcome between patients with and without anatomical recurrence was not found. Although an antireflux fundoplication does not prevent anatomical recurrence, the addition of a fundoplication is strongly recommended during large hiatal hernia repair, as reflux oesophagitis or pathological acid exposure is induced in a substantial number of patients if a fundoplication is omitted. Herein, the addition of a fundoplication does not negatively influence the symptomatic outcome in terms of new-onset daily complaints of dysphagia. Additionally, it was shown in this thesis that, in comparison with an antireflux fundoplication primarily performed for refractory gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, the extensive surgical dissection during laparoscopic large hiatal hernia repair, required to restore the anatomy, is not accompanied with more frequent or more severe dyspeptic symptoms.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Metal implants in treatment of cartilage defects'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Localized cartilage defects in the knee are associated with disability and symptoms such as joint pain, locking phenomena and reduced or disturbed function. Moreover, these defects predispose to severe forms of osteoarthritis. The surgical treatment of localized cartilage defects is usually aimed at stimulation of biological repair, including subchondral perforation and autologous chondrocyte transplantation. Although the biological repair treatment modalities are well established, the have limitations. Often, fibrous tissue is formed, which is frequently followed by progressive joint degeneration. A proposed alternative for the treatment of localized cartilage defects is the use of defect-sized metal implants. The central aim of this thesis was to better understand the role and limitations of using small metal (femoral condyle) implants for the treatment of cartilage defects in the knee joint as well as to investigate the surgical possibilities for replacement of a larger cartilage surface (the medial tibial plateau). This was evaluated using different materials (cobalt-chromium and oxidized zirconium) in different animal models (rabbit and goat) by applying validated outcome tools. Both rabbit and goat studies investigating a metal implant as a treatment for a femoral condyle cartilage defect showed encouraging results and raise other research questions. First, the implants of either material were firmly osseointegrated and biocompatible. It was shown that a flush positioning is essential in a rabbit knee, but this has not been investigated in a goat knee. Perhaps a larger sized implant in a goat (or human) knee should be placed different. This is still to be investigated. Furthermore, it remains unclear which bearing material is the best performer against the opposing cartilage when used as a small implant, although previous in vitro studies were favorable to OxZr. Perhaps, the femoral condyle implant model is not sensitive enough to differentiate. Other, less hard materials (with equivalent friction characteristics) should be investigated as well. All in all, caution is warranted when using small metal implants as a treatment for localized cartilage defects in a human knee joints. A major finding in these studies was the generalized cartilage degeneration irrespective of the treatment. This degeneration was not only found after treatment with a metal implant, but also after treatment with the microfracture technique, which was included as a control group. This microfracture technique is one of the frequently used treatment modalities for a localized cartilage defect. This aspect of the microfracture technique has not been given full attention in previous research. Furthermore, the current tibial plateau replacement model might be a viable tool in the evaluation of the applicability of defined hemiarthroplasty implants. Since only one bearing material (cobalt-chromium) was investigated in this study, it remains unclear whether the model is sensitive enough to discriminate between candidate materials. The implant was firmly fixed and allowed for unlimited weight bearing and movement of the knee, but considerable opposing cartilage degeneration was induced, which raises caution as to its application in the human setting.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The circulatory system consists of blood and lymphatic vessels. Both vessel types act in concert but differ significantly from each other in several structural and functional aspects. In addition, the mechanisms orchestrating their development are different. The blood vasculature transports oxygen, nutrients and cells to tissues whereas the lymphatic vessels collect extravasated fluid, macromolecules and cells of the immune system and return them back to the blood circulation. In comparison to what is known on the molecular mechanisms behind the developmental and functional regulation of blood vasculature, the lymphatic system yet remains behind. However, several markers specific for the lymphatic endothelium have been identified and key factors controlling the development and function of the lymphatic vessels have been discovered. Recently, the crucial importance of lymphatic vessels in certain pathological conditions such as lymphedema, inflammation and tumor metastasis has been recognized, thus increasing the interest in the biology of this vessel type. For quite a long time, it was believed that teleost fishes do not have a lymphatic system. However, in 2006 this long-standing controversy in developmental vascular biology was resolved. Importantly, mechanisms of the early development of the lymphatic vasculature in zebrafish show a high degree of conservation with higher vertebrates. Today, only a few genes (Prox-1, Flt-4, Vegf-C and Sox18) have been reported so far to be important for lymphangiogenesis. Zebrafish constitute a powerful genetic tool to discover new genes involved in lymphangiogenesis. For that purpose, forward genetic screens can be set up to identify mutants that either lack or have abnormal lymphatic vessels. In 2009, Hogan et al reported ccbe-1 gene to have a regulatory function in zebrafish lymphangiogenesis. Shortly after that, Alders et al reported that mutations in CCBE1 cause generalized lymph vessel dysplasia in humans, one of the hallmarks of lymphedema-lymphangiectasia-mental retardation or otherwise designated as the Hennekam syndrome. Taken together, these data demonstrate that this novel gene function, initially discovered to be essential for zebrafish lymphangiogenesis is also relevant for human lymphatic vessel formation and/or function. These findings have given new insight into the regulation of normal lymphatic development, as well as into the pathogenesis of diseases involving the lymphatic vasculature. Several interesting questions were posed that still need to be addressed. Ccbe-1 is an otherwise completely uncharacterized protein with an essential role in lymphangiogenesis. Therefore, investigating the role of CCBE-1 in more detail not only in zebrafish but also in the mouse model might provide crucial insights into the biological activity of the CCBE- 1 protein during development of the lymphatic system.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Prolonged Unexplained Fatigue in Paediatrics. Fatigue, as the result of mental or physical exertion, will disappear after rest, drinks and food. Fatigue as a symptom of illness will recover with the recovering of the illness. But when fatigue is ongoing for a long time, and not the result of exertion or a symptom of an illness, it will become a condition with a serious risk for the educational and social development of children and adolescents. This dissertation presents the results of research in children and adolescents (age 8-18 years), who were referred by their General Practitioner to the Paediatrician. Half of the patients recovered with usual care (i.e. reassurance and advices to visit school and to take part of social activities as much as possible), but the other half the same subjective fatigue severity with the same disabilities one year later and even two years later half of the young patients with CFS was still suffering in the same degree. That means that, notwithstanding all additional kinds of regular and alternative treatments, about one quarter of fatigued youngsters, who visited the paediatrician for the first time developed, a life with serious restrictions, without a medical explanation. These young patients stand for a great challenge to the paediatrician, when they visit him in the early stage of fatigue. The characteristics of the patients repudiate the opinion that ongoing fatigue in young people are related to today’s overloaded life style, late bed times and unhealthy habits. It seems the opposite, the patients participated less in social activities, in spite of good relationships and friendships. We found indications that family dynamics and/or genetic factors increased the vulnerability for fatigue, that life events might be provoking factors and that the social environment was little helpful in resistance. We discovered risk and protective factors for an unfavourable development in the beginning of fatigue. Risk factors were somatic complaints such as blurred vision, hot/ cold spells, constipation, memory deficits, pain in back and extremities, the degree of subjective fatigue measured by the CIS-20, and female gender. Protective was a physically active life style before the onset of fatigue. We found a significant different effect between sport activities in sport clubs and self regulated sports activities. Remarkable was the finding that three patients with the most self regulated sports activities had the worst outcome one year later. The risk and protective factors can be directive for customizing treatment for the individual patient, because the group of fatigued patients is heterogeneous. We explored, on top of the usual care, the usefulness of a video film intervention aiming at the education about the diagnosis CFS and the modelling of coping behaviour. The intervention with that particular film had an adverse effect. Compared with patients who received only usual care, patients who received the film in addition, were equally fatigued but had more school absence and were less motivated one year later. We interpreted the adverse effects as the result of the double message of the film. It is possible that patients particularly picked up the first massage (i.e. fatigue complaints may be the result of a well-known condition: CFS)as an explanation and legitimization of their complaints, but the second message(i.e. how to cope successfully with debilitating fatigue and unhelpful thoughts) did not get across. The conclusion is a serious warning against assigning the label of CFS too early to fatigued children and adolescents.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['The structural core of prion disease'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) or prion diseases are serious neurological ailments, in which the brain tissue deteriorates by progressive loss of brain cells which results in the loss of a wide variety of brain functions, including memory, speech and locomotion. Similar conditions can be observed in patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In TSEs, Alzheimer’s disease, and some more protein folding diseases a key factor in the pathogenesis is the deposition of aggregated aberrant proteins, often accompanied by amyloid fibril formation. In prion diseases the pathogenic particle is a malformed version of the prion protein (PrP) in which the endogenous prion protein (PrPC) is transformed into a malformed pathogenic version (PrPSc) with a higher beta-sheet content compared with PrPC. The conformational change of PrPC into PrPSc is caused by an other PrPSc molecule which functions as a template forcing the PrPC into the PrPSc form. The malformed PrPSc accumulates in amyloidogenic fibrils which form insoluble aggregates. These aggregates are associated with the loss of brain cells. Structural knowledge of the malformed protein is essential for the development of therapeutics. Therefore, two new in vitro assays are developed to study PrP and A-beta peptide fibril formation. Both assays depend on reproducible fibril formation. This is achieved either by drying the peptides prior to fibril specific staining, or the addition of polyanionic compounds which act as fibril promoting scaffolds. The assays allowed us to study the fibril interfering properties of tetracyclic compounds and beta-breaker peptides and the fibril promoting activity of C1q and SAP. Most likely these assays are more widely applicable for other fibrillogenic proteins and peptides. Furthermore, the assays helped to validate the theoretical two-rung left-handed beta-helix model of the PrPSc core. According to this model each PrPSc monomer contributes two beta-helical rungs to the fibril. Two cyclized human PrP peptides, corresponding to rung one and rung two of the left-handed beta-helical core of the human PrPSc fibril, show spontaneous cooperative fibril growth in vitro. The unique approach of stacking two different peptides was also used to develop peptide-based therapeutics. The strategy, coined as “stack-and-stop”, is based on a combination of a fibril stimulating peptide and a fibril stopper peptide. The study of fibril inhibiting peptides requires a controllable fibril growth. Therefore the stimulator peptide was designed as an optimal left-handed-beta-helical fold that can serve as a template for fibril growth initiation. The inhibiting peptide was designed to bind to the exposed rung, but frustrate the propagation of the fibril growth. The single inhibitory peptide hardly shows inhibition, but the combination of the inhibitory with the stimulatory peptide showed complete inhibition of the fibril growth. The unique strategy based on stimulatory and inhibitory peptides seems a powerful new approach to study amyloidogenic fibril structures in general and could prove useful for the development of therapeutics.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Role of meningococcal Toll-like receptor agonists in disease and immunity'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Neisseria meningitidis is a Gram-negative bacterium that may cause the life-threatening diseases meningitis and sepsis in humans. Much of the symptoms seen in these diseases are not caused by the bacterium directly, but are the result of overstimulation of the immune system. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a major component of the bacterial outer membrane, is thought to play a major role in the pathology of these diseases, because it activates the immune system very potently. The Netherlands Vaccine Institute is currently developing a vaccine against N. meningitidis that consists of outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). This vaccine still contains LPS, which is not ideal due to its toxicity. On the other hand, by activating the immune system LPS improves the immune response after vaccination. Therefore, LPS is a good adjuvant. LPS initiates activation of the immune system by binding to its receptor Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4, which is expressed by numerous cell types of the host. Currently, several other TLRs have been identified and each TLR recognizes different structures derived from microbes. Activation of all TLRs eventually leads to activation of the immune system. This means that all TLRs are potential adjuvant targets. In addition, TLRs differ in the pathways that become activated after recognition of its ligand. As a consequence the type of immune response that is induced depends on which TLR is activated. The aim of the study described in this thesis was to investigate which TLR ligands are suitable adjuvants for a meningococcal vaccine and to understand their mode of action. In addition, we explored the impact of modulation of meningococcal structures recognized by TLR ligands on the host response after infection with N. meningitidis. We found that several TLRs are interesting adjuvant targets for a vaccine against meningococci. Besides TLR4, OMVs also activate TLR2. We show that in mice TLR4 activation is essential for optimal immune responses after immunization with OMVs, but that TLR2 activation is not required. In addition, we found that around 10% of patients with meningococcal disease are infected with an LPS-mutant that is hardly recognized by TLR4. Interestingly, patients infected with this mutant showed much less severe symptoms. Finally, we demonstrate that modulation of the LPS structure has a big impact on the virulence of N. meningitidis in a mouse model of meningococcal disease. Together our results illustrate the dominant role played by LPS in meningococcal disease and immunity. In addition, our results suggest that wild-type LPS in a meningococcal vaccine can be replaced by mutant LPS or TLR ligands that activate the immune system less potently, but still well enough for a good immune response after vaccination.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['The clinical use of near infrared spectroscopy-monitored cerebral oxygen saturation and extraction in the preterm infant'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Survival of extremely preterm infants has greatly improved over the last decades. Despite this, perinatal brain damage with adverse neurodevelopmental outcome is still affecting a considerable number of these infants. Although the etiology of brain damage is multifactorial and even partly unknown, hypoxia, hyperoxia and hemodynamic instability during the first days of life seem to play an important role. The present thesis describes and discusses the clinical use of a promising non-invasive brain monitoring technique, the near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)-monitored regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rScO2) and cerebral fractional tissue oxygen extraction (cFTOE). The study investigates the patterns of rScO2 and cFTOE in preterm infants with a gestational age of less than 32 weeks during the first days of life, together with other monitoring parameters during different clinical conditions. The technique is based on the transparency of biological tissue to near infrared light and its subsequent absorption by chromophores (hemoglobin). Absorption changes in near infrared light can be converted into concentration changes of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin and from here to regional oxygen saturation (rScO2). Together with the arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2), cFTOE can be calculated ((SaO2-rScO2)/SaO2). Reference values of rScO2 range from 61 to 75% in the human neonate. An important finding was that during stable and physiological SaO2-values no differences between left- and right sided NIRS-monitored values were noted. This suggests that unilateral NIRS-monitoring can serve as trend monitoring in these infants to detect important changes in cerebral oxygenation. Although there was a larger variance in preterm infants suffering from severe respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), mean values of rScO2 and cFTOE did not differ from a control group without RDS. However, RDS infants had more periods of a significant correlation between rScO2 (and cFTOE) and mean arterial blood pressure, suggesting more periods of lack of cerebral-vascular autoregulation. No changes of rScO2 and cFTOE were measured during treatment of RDS with the InSurE-procedure: i.e. short term Intubation for exogenous Surfactant treatment followed by Extubation, a method to prevent mechanical ventilation induced lung damage. Therefore, this method seems not to affect the cerebral oxygen supply. The study demonstrated also that infants with a persistent ductus arteriosus (PDA), a common problem in preterm infants, had lower rScO2‘s and higher cFTOE’s compared with a control group up to 24 hours after initiating pharmacological treatment with indomethacin. Twelve out of twenty infants with PDA treated with surgery after pharmalogical treatment failed showed a further decrease of rScO2 during surgery. Therefore, the study shows also that surgical closure of a duct carries the risk for a further decrease of an already compromised cerebral oxygenation in infants with a PDA. Finally, the relation between rScO2 and neurodevelopmental outcome was investigated in 36 infants. Despite the small sample size, it was surprising that rScO2s on day 1 were higher (rScO2 >70%) in infants with a suboptimal neurodevelopmental outcome. At this stage NIRS-monitored oxygenation of the immature brain by rScO2 lacks precision to be used as robust quantitative variable to monitor cerebral oxygenation, but when used merely as a trend monitor in the individual patient, substantial changes of rScO2 and consequently of cFTOE, can yield important clinical information that may lead to intervention. One of the main problems is that the precision of the commercially available devices is not optimal and that the sensors are not optimized for the smallest infants. Devices that are more precise and sensors that are smaller will have to be developed for the use in the very small preterm infant. Furthermore, lower and upper limits of rScO2 will have to be defined in more detail.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['A low lifetime endogenous estrogen exposure is suggested to promote cardiovascular disease and related death after menopause in women. As a logical consequence, the view that the cardiovascular disease risk might be reversed by replacing the endogenous estrogens by exogenous estrogens in the form of hormone therapy became popular. Indeed, observational studies report risk reductions up to 30-50%, but the clinical trials unexpectedly showed that hormone therapy does not provide coronary protection. However, whereas vasomotor menopausal symptoms, such as hot flushes and night sweats are the main indication for prescribing hormone therapy in the population, women with severe symptoms were either excluded in the clinical trials or comprised only a minority of the total randomized population, due to ethical reasons. We suggested previously that women suffering from vasomotor symptoms may differ from those without with respect to responses to hormone therapy or susceptibility to estrogens. The main aim of this thesis was to study this specific hypothesis. We used data of a Dutch and Swedish population based sample of 10.787 peri- and postmenopausal women. We first investigated whether women with vasomotor symptoms had a different cardiovascular risk profile, and whether circulating estradiol levels could explain possible differences. Women with vasomotor symptoms had increased systolic and diastolic blood pressures, body mass index, waist hip ratio, cholesterol-, low density lipoprotein- and triglycerides levels compared to asymptomatic women. However, the less favourable cardiovascular risk profile among symptomatic women could not be explained by circulating estradiol levels. We subsequently studied the relationship between vasomotor symptoms and clinical manifest endpoints of coronary heart disease, and whether a possible association could be explained by the increased cardiovascular risk factors. Women with (night) sweats had a 41% increased risk of coronary heart disease, which could also not be explained by cardiovascular risk factors. These findings suggest that women with vasomotor symptoms may therefore experience cardiovascular benefits of hormone therapy. To study this, we examined whether the association between hormone therapy use and coronary heart disease risk differed for women with and without vasomotor symptoms. Among women with intense vasomotor symptoms, defined as (night) sweats in combination with the most frequent/severe flushes, use of hormone therapy was associated with a 61% lower risk (hazard ratio 0.39 [95% confidence interval 0.18-0.87]) on coronary heart disease, as compared to never use. On the contrary, among women without intense vasomotor symptoms, hormone therapy use was associated with a borderline significant 29% increased coronary heart disease risk (hazard ratio 1.29 [95% confidence interval 0.97-1.72]). The test for interaction between hormone use and intense vasomotor symptoms was statistically significant (P-value 0.03). From the studies described in the present thesis, we found that vasomotor symptoms are risk factors for coronary heart disease, and that hormone therapy could reduce the risk among women with symptoms. These findings should preferably be confirmed in randomized comparisons. Nevertheless, our findings suggest that the presence of vasomotor symptoms contributes to the discordant outcomes of the clinical trials and observational studies on hormone therapy and coronary heart disease risk.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Of all stroke patients 5% has a subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH); a bleed in the space between the brain and the skull that contains blood vessels that supply the brain. Every year 9 per 100.000 patients have an SAH and half the patients are younger than 55 years old. In most instances (80%) the cause of the bleeding is a ruptured aneurysm and in 10% a perimesencephalic nonaneurysmal haemorrhage (PMH). Patients with a PMH have a good short term outcome. The cause of a PMH is probably a venous source. Aneurysmal SAH has a poor outcome: 35% dies in the first 4 weeks after the haemorrhage and 20% remains dependent for activities of daily life. Life expectancy is reduced after aneurysmal SAH, probably from an excess of other heart and vessel diseases. Chapter 2 describes the supplemental value of scrutinising the history of relatives to detect SAH and heart and vessel diseases in 1290 first degree and 3588 second degree relatives of a consecutively collected cohort of 163 patients with SAH. Almost half of the families with a positive history for SAH in a first or second degree relative would have been gone undetected without the information provided by scrutinising all individual relatives. In Chapter 3 we studied the feasibility of follow-up through e-mail in patients discharged after SAH. E-mail follow-up was easy to perform, comfortable for the patient or relative and less time-consuming than follow-up by telephone. However, only 60% of all included patients had an e-mail address and 21% of those patients changed once or more the e-mail address. In Chapter 4 we describe a long-term follow-up study to assess life expectancy in 160 patients with a PMH with a total number of patients-years of 1213. At time of follow-up (range 1 – 23 years) 149 patients were still alive. Patients with PMH have no excess in mortality compared with the general population. In Chapter 5 we studied anosmia after PMH. The presumed causes of anosmia after a ruptured aneurysmal SAH are the sudden intracranial arterial pressure or the presence of blood in itself. It is unknown whether anosmia can develop after a PMH. Nine of 148 included patients had noticed a loss of smell already during the clinical course. Two patients reported a complete recovery after 8 to 12 weeks. We found no relation between anosmia and risk factors such as age, sex or hydrocephalus. Chapter 6 describes long-term outcome of 92 patients discharged to a nursing home after SAH. After 2 years 28 (30%) of these patients were discharged home or to another facility and forty-four patients (43%) lived longer than 5 years. Chapter 7 is a continuation of a former study of quality of life 4 and 18 months after SAH. In that cohort of patients there was improvement of functional outcome measured in modified Rankin scale and quality of life measured in SF-36 and a VAS score. Overall there was still an improvement in quality of life, while functional outcome worsened between 5 and 12.5 years.'],\n",

The observed gene expression differences between CRS patients and healthy controls were modest, but pointed at modulated inflammation and oxidative stress, two of the systems that have previously been proposed as important connectors between the heart and the kidney. Erythropoietin (EPO) treatment, well-known for its erythropoiesis stimulating effect, has also shown beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system in some, but not all studies. Mechanisms underlying EPO effects are not fully understood. Effects of short-term EPO treatment on monocyte transcriptomes were evaluated in CRS patients to identify underlying mechanisms of non-hematopoietic EPO actions. Limited effects of low EPO dose to treat renal anemia were observed. Of note, at this regular EPO dose no harmful effects could be detected. Furthermore, we characterized endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) levels and function, as key players of endothelial repair, in several conditions with increased cardiovascular disease. Decreased levels of circulating EPC were demonstrated during aging in healthy subjects, in children with end-stage chronic kidney disease, in adults with predialysis chronic kidney disease and a history of cardiovascular disease and in CRS patients. Our data suggest that renal dysfunction in particular in presence of other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g. inflammation) is associated with decreased EPC levels and may contribute to accelerated atherosclerosis. Our findings open a new field of possible interventions to reduce cardiovascular risk in these populations. The mechanisms underlying reduced EPC availability in these conditions remain to be clarified in order to design effective treatment strategies. Since beneficial effects of EPO on EPC mobilization have previously been shown in experimental studies, short- and long-term effects of EPO treatment on EPC were evaluated in CRS patients. In line with limited short-term EPO effects on monocyte gene expression profiles, no changes in EPC levels or function were observed. After 52 weeks however, EPO stabilized EPC levels, while levels decreased in patients without EPO therapy. These data suggest that reduction of circulating EPC levels in CRS patients, which may contribute to the increased CVD risk, can be decelerated by long-term EPO treatment.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Conventional chemotherapy has shown its effectivity in the treatment of many cancers types. Nevertheless, because of the non-specificity of the agents, this tumor destroying capacity goes hand in hand with damage to the healthy tissues, expressed as unwanted toxicity. The past decades this treatment emerging toxicity seemed to be well managed by standard care strategies. Still, it is desirable to only target the tumor cells, resulting in a more effective therapeutical potential of anti cancer agents and less unwanted side effects. From that point of view, in the treatment of cancer the focus has shifted from general cytotoxic agents to a more cell specific, targeted therapy. A multitude of ‘targeting’ agents has been explored and some of them have already proven their therapeutical activity and are nowadays implemented as standard care for certain cancer types. In this dissertation I focussed on endothelial cells and their role and implications in the treatment of cancer. These cells reconstitute a specific target for therapy as they are the building blocks for the vasculature, and in specific tumor vasculature. Endothelial cells can be inhibited by interference in the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signalling pathway, a growth factor involved in endothelial cell proliferation, migration and function. VEGF inhibiting agents reconstitute a powerful target for therapy, as single agent therapy, but also as part of combinatorial regimens. Within this spectrum, as having an important function in normal physiology, endothelial cells also play an important role in VEGF inhibition induced toxicity. Contrary to expectations, despite the specificity of this kind of treatment, these endothelial cells play also an important role in normal physiology and this is reflected in a specific toxicity profile. Endothelial cell/ angiogenesis inhibition by blocking VEGF-mediated signaling can result in serious side effects in a substantial proportion of patients. Most of these side effects seem to be manageable, but likely will become more problematic when survival increases. Therefore it is desirable to elucidate the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, to provide new insights into the pathogenesis of this toxicity in order to manage these side effects effectively. Finally this could result in the development of more specific angiogenesis inhibitors. Although being claimed as promising agents, major encumbrances still exist consisting of the considerable side effects especially when treatment is continued for a longer period, the apparently inevitable resistance to this kind of agents on the long run and the substantial costs of the treatment. For that reason, it is desirable to be able to select only those patients who will benefit from treatment and to recognize resistance. By means of a predictieve biomarker it might be possible to make this selection, and consequently to prevent overtreatment and unneeded toxicity and to early recognize resistance to the drug. The final implication of endothelial cells discussed in this thesis is that they would be candidates for the role as a surrogate biomarker in angiogenesis inhibition. Before this last application can be implemented, general agreement of the true identity and the most proper way to enumerate these cells should be achieved.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Molecular characteristics of pancreatic carcinogenesis'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas is a very aggressive disease with a high mortality rate. Pancreatic carcinoma is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death in Western countries, despite the fact this cancer accounts for only about 3% of all malignant tumors. Most pancreatic cancers (approximately 80%) are diagnosed at a late, incurable stage. The poor prognosis and late presentation of pancreatic cancer patients underscore the importance of early detection, which is the sine qua non for the fight against pancreatic cancer. The possibility for early detection of pancreatic cancer may be realized by increasing our knowledge of the histology and molecular genetics of precursor lesions of pancreatic cancer in conjunction with the development of sensitive and specific screening tests (both invasive and non-invasive) to detect early pancreatic cancer. In this thesis we examined the potential use of MicroRNAs (miRNAs) as a biomarker for the early detection of pancreatic cancer and investigated several signaling pathways to explore their role in pancreatic tumorigenesis and the development of its precursor lesions. We found out that aberrant miRNA expression is an early event in the multistage progression of pancreatic cancer, and specifically miR-155 warrants further evaluation as a biomarker for pancreatic cancer in clinical samples. Furthermore, we looked at the Notch and Axl pathway in the setting of pancreatic cancer. Both pathways play a significant role in pancreatic carcinogenesis. Inhibition of the Notch or Axl pathway, in a panel of pancreatic cancer cell lines, resulted in significant reduction in cell viability, anchorage independent growth, as well as attenuation of migratory and invasive properties. These reports support and emphasize an important function of Notch and Axl in pancreatic cancer and both signaling pathways might be a promising therapeutic strategy in this carcinoma. Finally, we have characterized DNA Damage Response markers (DDR) in PanIN lesions to determine whether or not these are involved in early pancreatic neoplasia. Activation of the ATM-Chk2 checkpoint pathways was commonly observed in PanIN lesions, which suggest that ATM and Chk2 activation at early stage of pancreatic tumorigenesis suppresses tumor progression. Loss of p53 function appears to be a critical determinant for bypassing this checkpoint and the subsequent progression to invasive adenocarcinoma. In summary, the above studies in this thesis describe potential clinically useful biomarkers for pancreatic carcinogenesis. Moreover, our increased knowledge of the Notch and Axl signaling pathway in pancreatic tumorigenesis may provide the basis for developing more sensitive screening strategies and the identification of new drug targets enabling directed drug design. All this will enable us to develop better tools for primary and secondary prevention of pancreatic cancer, as well as improve existing tools for early diagnosis.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Environmental health problems have become increasingly complex. Climate change, increased urbanization or exposure to electromagnetic fields are highly divergent examples of issues about which no scientific consensus exists, for which no straightforward solutions are available and which are embedded in a wide societal context. It is challenging to assess the health impacts of such so-called “systemic risks”. Integrated Environmental Health Impact Assessment (IEHIA) has been proposed as a set of methods to deal with systemic risks in environmental health. IEHIA includes, amongst others, methods to take account of complexities and uncertainties, potential indirect effects, effects in the far future, and stakeholder perspectives. This thesis presents some methods that can be applied in IEHIA, illustrated with example applications. As such, it makes insights from other disciplines relevant and practicable for environmental health researchers. The methods that are being described include (1) the use of conceptual frameworks, (2) the selection and presentation of indicators, (3) dealing with uncertainties and (4) methods for expert elicitation. (1) Conceptual frameworks are –often graphical- representations of the issues that are being assessed and the relationships between the various elements in IEHIA. These frameworks may for example show the links between the driving forces of environmental problems, the exposure in the population and the subsequent health or economical effects. We distinguish different types of conceptual frameworks and illustrate their potential uses in IEHIA. (2) Indicators are used to communicate the results of IEHIA. They present the relevant outcomes of an assessment in a clear and effective way. This thesis provides guidelines for the selection and presentation of indicators. (3) Uncertainty is an important and often partly ignored element in assessments. Uncertainties can be expressed quantitative of qualitative, derive from natural variation or lack of knowledge, involve the boundaries of the assessment or a specific model parameter, etc. A typology of uncertainty is presented which can be used to characterize different types of uncertainties. It points into directions for dealing with these uncertainties and is illustrated using examples from environmental burden of disease studies. (4) Expert elicitation can be a tool to deal with uncertainties, in case no further empirical evidence can easily be derived. We describe a structured stepwise approach towards organizing a formal expert elicitation. Customization of these steps for specific applications is necessary, based on the types of uncertainties considered, the intended use of the elicited information, and the available resources. The expert elicitation procedure is applied in the context of impact assessment of ultrafine particles (UFP), the smallest fraction of air pollution. Opinions of twelve leading European scientists have been elicited about (1) the health effects considered to be causally related to exposure to UFP; (2) the potential causal mechanisms that underlie UFP-related cardiovascular effects and (3) the concentration-response functions that quantitatively describe the effect of UFP on a variety of health endpoints. Finally, all the methods outlined above are discussed in the context of the need for further development of IEHIA methods and the limitations and potential benefits of the methodology.'],\n",

       "  'Description': [\"This historical study of Puritan spirituality focuses on the theme of spiritual warfare in English Puritan writings of the period 1587-1684. Within Puritan spirituality the metaphor of spiritual warfare stands out. On his path of life to the future kingdom of God the believer meets the enemies of Satan, sin and flesh, who all intend his doom. In order to make the different ramification of this spiritual confrontation clear, this study has chosen to analyse various representative writings on precisely this theme. The dissertation's historical part begins in chapter 1 with a description of the early modern English context of the Puritan movement prior to 1625. In this period the Puritan movement occupies an ambivalent position as far as the relation between church and society is concerned. One the one hand the Puritan movement comes up in a reformed church with a broas 'calvinistic or reformed consensus'. From the start, however, the movement also criticizes the lack of continuous reformation with the English Established Church. Chapters 2-7 discuss the way in which the selected publications portray the different opponents, followed by a sketch of the Christian soldier. Having examined the strength of his opponents, this part of the book also explores the various ways in which the believer can react effectively. The following authors are discussed: William Perkins, William Gouge, John Downame, Thomas Brooks, William Gurnall, John Owen, Isaac Ambrose, Richard Gilpin, and John Bunyan. The thematic part of the dissertation starts with chapter 8, which interprets the Puritan writings about the spiritual combat back in the pastoral setting of Puritan practical divinity. Great importance should be attached to the pastoral context of English congregations in the post-reformation Establshed Church. Chapter 9 deals with the use of biblical exegesis in Puritan writings about spiritual warfare. Chapter 10 applies a more thematic approach to the spiritual enemies Satan, world, and flesh, while chapter 11 deals with the theme of spiritual resistance. Chapter 12 discusses 'religious despair' as a theme that goes to the heart of Puritan spirituality, pervading most writings about spiritual combat. A comparative and concluding part rounds off this study. Chapter 13 illustrates the unique dynamics of Puritan spiritual conflict by bringing in the voices of different West-European authors, such as Jean Gerson, Desiderius Erasmus, Martin Luther, Ignatius of Loyola and Theodore Beza. Containing the book's conclusion, chapter 14 argues that the prominent place of spiritual warfare in Puritan spirituality is best explained based on a convergence of interconnected factors: pastoral, spiritual, ecclesiastical and social. The dissertation concludes by saying that the combination of Trinity, historia salutis, and affective piety can be seen as constitutive of the Puritan position in the history of West-European spirituality in general and of Puritan spiritual warfare literature in particular.\"],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Tooth resorption in cats Tooth resorption affecting several teeth is a painful disease with a prevalence of up to 75% in household cats and is often accompanied by periodontitis. Tooth resorption is caused by an increased number and activity of tooth-resorbing odontoclasts, cells that share functional characteristics with bone-resorbing osteoclasts. Both vitamin D and inflammatory cytokines stimulate the formation and activity of osteoclasts. Most mammals are able to synthesize vitamin D in their skin, but cats are not able to do so and thus depend on their dietary intake for their vitamin D requirements. Both a deficiency and an excess of dietary vitamin D have been hypothesized to be involved in tooth resorption. The overall focus of this thesis was to gain insight into the possible role of vitamin D and inflammation in tooth resorption in cats. Binding of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25(OH)2D) to the nuclear vitamin D receptor (nVDR) of fibroblasts and odontoclasts near active resorptive lesions was found to induce the transcription of target genes of the vitamin D pathway, i.e. 1?-hydroxylase, 24-hydroxylase, receptor-activator of NF?B ligand (RANKL), and VDR itself. Inflammatory cells were often found in the resorption lacunae, and the expression of inflammatory cytokine was increased in surrounding tissues. The stimulatory effect of 1,25(OH)2D on osteoclast formation was demonstrated in vitro by the formation of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase multinucleated cells from peripheral blood originating from cats with tooth resorption. Periodontal pathogenic bacteria may be part of the aetiopathogenesis of tooth resorption in cats through the lipopolysaccharide-induced increase in odontoclast activity. Two periodontal pathogens, Porphyromonas spp. and Tanerella forsythia, were found in dental plaque samples from cats. Two identical isolates of Tanerella forsythia of feline origin were found in a cat and its owner, which supported the idea that cats are a potential source of a periodontal zoonotic agent. Findings support the conclusion that odontoclast activity in cats with tooth resorption is stimulated by locally produced 1,25(OH)2D, facilitated through the nVDR expressing fibroblasts and odontoclasts and enhanced by inflammatory products. Local up-regulation of target genes of the vitamin D pathway further supports the observed increase in the activity of local vitamin D metabolites. We propose that not dietary vitamin D excess but inflammation-induced stimulation of the vitamin D pathway is involved in the pathogenesis of tooth resorption in cats.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['This thesis addresses several clinical aspects of pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) in patients with hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), also known as Rendu-Osler-Weber disease. HHT is characterized by arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in multiple organs and inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. PAVMs result in a right-to-left shunt which bypasses the pulmonary capillary filter, and are responsible for a high prevalence of brain abscess and ischemic stroke in HHT patients. Therefore, all HHT patients are routinely screened for PAVMs. Results In the first part we compared TTCE as a screening technique for PAVM with chest computed tomography (CT) as the gold standard, in a prospective study of almost 300 patients. The sensitivity of TTCE was 97% and negative predictive value 99%. However, no treatable PAVMs were missed. TTCE was also positive in 59% of patients without a PAVM on chest CT. Therefore, it appears that TTCE detects even small intrapulmonary shunts below the detection limit of CT. In a second study, the use of semi-quantitative grading (minimal, moderate, and large) of pulmonary shunt size was investigated. We showed that in patients with small shunts, no treatable PAVMs were found. This implies that a chest CT can be withheld in this group of patients. In the second part we show that a pulmonary shunt on TTCE is more prevalent and larger in HHT1 relatives (positive TTCE in 85%, of which 54% large shunts), as compared with HHT2 related mutation carriers (positive TTCE in 35%, of which 59% small shunts). Shunt grading is particularly helpful in HHT2 patients, as most patients in this group have small shunts. TTCE appeared to be also positive in 6.3% of persons without HHT. The clinical diagnosis of HHT is based on the presence of at least three of four criteria, of which one is the presence of visceral AVMs. We studied the use of TTCE to assess this criterium. The use of TTCE slightly improved clinical diagnosis in patients with genetically confirmed HHT, but also raised false positive clinical diagnosis from 0 to 6.5% in persons without HHT. In the third part we show that a PAVM on chest CT is independently associated with MA (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.00–9.20; p=0.05). Using echocardiographic shunt grading, a large shunt increased the risk for MA more than seven-fold after multivariate analysis (OR 7.61; 95% 3.11-18.61; p<0.001). Small and moderate shunts were not associated with MA. Conclusion TTCE can be used as a first-line screening test for PAVM, only followed by chest CT to detect treatable PAVMs when positive for a pulmonary shunt. A graded approach of intrapulmonary shunting should be employed to identify patients with small pulmonary shunts in whom unnecessary additional testing can be prevented. A pulmonary shunt on TTCE should not automatically be regarded as a clinical criterium for HHT because it raises false-positive diagnosis. This relates to the presence of a small intrapulmonary shunts in a part of the general population. A large intrapulmonary shunt, but not shunts of lesser degree, is a strong independent predictor for MA+.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Adenoviruses (HAdV) can cause serious life threatening infections, especially in pediatric patients after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). To improve the morbidity and mortality rate of HAdV infected patients after SCT three issues have been explored: which patients are at risk for HAdV infection, what is the best treatment for HAdV infected patients and when do we start treatment. We found that in pediatric patients HAdV-DNA positivity in nasopharyngeal aspirate before SCT is a very important risk factor for developing invasive HAdV infection after SCT. As determined with multiplex immuno-assay we also found that children with a localized HAdV infection have a different cytokine profile compared with patients with an invasive HAdV infection after SCT. Cytokine signatures can also be helpful to differentiate invasive HAdV infection from other SCT related complications as Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD) and Epstein-barr virus infection. Immune profiling could possibly help to identify patients at high risk in an earlier stage. Because no effective medication for HAdV infection exists and HAdV-specific T-cells are critically involved in virus elimination, an alternative treatment option is the adoptive transfer of HAdV-specific T-cells from the graft donor into the recipient. One of the potential risks of using HAdV-specific T-cells for adoptive therapy is the risk for GvHD. The use of a high purity of HAdV-specific CD4+ T-cells would strongly reduce this risk. By using a computer algorithm designed to predict pan HLA-DR binding T-cell epitopes we detected six 15-mer epitopes from HAdV. These epitopes induce a proliferative T-cell response in the majority of healthy controls. By culturing peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of healthy donors with identified HAdV epitopes it is possible to generate CD4+ HAdV-specific T-cells. With artificial antigen presenting cells, composed of liposomes harboring a HAdV-peptide and MHC-class II complex, these HAdV-specific T-cells could be isolated. Isolated HAdV CD4+ specific T-cells are fully functional, produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, express the cytotoxins perforin and granzyme B, kill HAdV-infected cells effectively and do not show alloreactivity. Because umbilical cord blood transplants (UCB) emerge as an alternative stem cell source for SCT, and immune reconstitution is delayed in patients receiving UCB, higher infection rates with HAdV are expected to emerge. In case of HAdV infection after UCB transplantation adoptive therapy with HAdV-specific T-cells derived from cord blood seems also a promising treatment option. However, the induction of HAdV-specific T-cells from UCB requires the priming and expansion of naive T-cells rather than expansion of pre-existing virus-specific memory T-cells. By stimulating cord blood mononuclear cells with 15-mer peptides we showed that HAdV-specific T-cells could be generated. The HAdV-specific T-cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, perforin and granzyme B, all necessary for viral elimination. The generation of HAdV-specific T-cells in response to HAdV peptides seems an essential step in developing tailor-made therapy for HAdV infection for recipients of SCT transplants. In the near future probably high-risk patients may be treated prophylactically with adoptive transfer of HAdV-specific T-cells, possibly in association with antiviral medication. These new approaches hopefully will lead to reduction in incidence and mortality rate associated with HAdV infection after SCT.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The current dissertation focused on adolescent identity formation and personality development. We focused on how these aspects of individuality develop through adolescence, and how individual differences in (the development of) personality and identity relate to problem behavior. For that purpose, we applied: a) variable-centered approaches focusing on how particular traits or dimensions change on average in a group of individuals, and whether individual differences in traits or dimensions are stable or fluctuate across time; and b) person-centered approaches focusing on how a configuration of traits is organized within an individual. Data were used from three longitudinal projects: CONAMORE, RADAR, and L-TIDES. In addition, data from a cross-sectional project involving juvenile delinquents and clinically referred youth was used. Participants in these projects filled out questionnaires on personality, identity formation, conflicts with parents, friendship quality, academic adjustment, and problem behavior. Variable-centered to personality revealed that adolescent’s personalities matured, as they became more agreeable, extraverted, and open to experience when they grew older. In addition, inter-individual differences became more set, and traits became more consistently organized within individuals. For all aspects of development, girls were ahead on boys. Development of personality traits was strongly interrelated with development of problem behavior symptoms, as specific personality characteristics seemed to put adolescents at risk for developing problem behavior symptoms, but problem behavior symptoms also seemed to affect adolescent personality traits. Person-centered approaches to personality revealed that three classic personality types (Resilients, Undercontrollers, and Overcontrollers) were replicable as trajectories of personality development. With another person-centered approach to personality, we showed that it is not the stability of a profile that is linked to psychological adjustment, but the degree to which an individual’s personality profile matches the profile of the average person within a sample. From a developmental perspective, an individual’s personality profile can diverge from the profile of the average person in two ways: one can either be ahead (i.e., hypermaturity) or lag behind (i.e., immaturity) in development. We showed that hypermaturity is related to internalizing problems in boys and girls. Immaturity is related to externalizing problems, but only in girls. With regard to identity formation, early adolescents became increasingly more certain about their current commitments as they exhibited decreases in reconsideration. Middle and late adolescents were involved in identity evaluation, as they exhibited increases in in-depth exploration. As with personality development, girls also seemed to be ahead on boys in identity formation. By tracking early adolescents with daily internet assessments, we demonstrated that identity formation is guided by a certainty-uncertainty (commitment-reconsideration) dynamic that operates on day-to-day level. Moreover, fluctuations in reconsideration predicted a weaker sense of identity in general. Finally, we demonstrated that identity formation is more strongly related to severe forms of delinquency than to other types of severe problem behavior, as juvenile delinquents displayed much more problems with identity formation than clinically referred youth did. In sum, we demonstrated important development changes in personality and identity. Individual differences in (changes in) personality and identity were found to be strongly related to problem behavior.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Osteoarthritis is the most common joint disease and an important cause of physical disability. Clinical symptoms are frequently associated with a significant functional impairment and signs and symptoms of inflammation, including pain, stiffness and loss of mobility. In osteoarthritis the balance between cartilage synthesis and degradation is disturbed as a result of an altered mainly autocrine exposure of the chondrocytes to various cytokines and growth factors. RA is a chronic, inflammatory, systemic autoimmune disease. The cartilage and bone destruction in RA are directly linked to the exacerbation of inflammatory processes in the synovial membrane. The prevalence rates of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis are expected to increase in the coming years due to the increasing proportion of the elderly in the population. Up to 50% of the patients suffering from osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis report the use of alternative remedies including natural products. These so-called nutraceuticals cover a broad range of products including nutrients, herbal preparations and dietary supplements. The way of action of a number of possible cartilage-protective and/or anti-inflammatory natural products is studied in vitro and in different in vivo mouse models A Grifola frondosa (Maitake) extract and a Centella asiatica fraction have been evaluated. Both, the Grifola frondosa extract and the Centella asiatica triterpenes fraction were able to stimulate glycosaminoglycan synthesis and inhibit proteoglycan degradation by bovine chondrocytes. In vivo studies demonstrated that the tested Centella asiatica fraction was able to inhibit the zymosan-induced cartilage degradation, although the zymosan-induced inflammatory cell infiltration and joint swelling were not affected. These results picture a cartilage protective effect. The herbal mixture SKI306X is on the market in Australia and Korea as a remedy for OA patients. The inhibitory effect of SKI306X and its individual herbal extracts on IL-1beta-induced proteoglycan degradation and nitric oxide and PGE2 production by bovine cartilage explants indicate a cartilage protective effect. Moreover, SKI306X also inhibits lipopolysaccharide-stimulated TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and PGE2 production by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, demonstrating an anti-inflammatory and possibly an analgesic capacity. Apocynin can be isolated from the Himalayan herb Picrorhiza kurrooa. It was found that orally ingested apocynin partially counteracts the zymosan-induced inhibition of proteoglycan synthesis in the mouse knee joint. Moreover, apocynin is able to induce a cyclooxygenase inhibitory effect in mice, similar ibuprofen. The simple amino acid glycine and the milk protein lactoferrin have been indicated to contain anti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory activities. Both glycine and bovine lactoferrin are able to decrease ear swelling in a zymosan-induced ear-skin inflammation model. A combination of bovine lactoferrin and glycine counteracted the zymosan-induced ear swelling synergistically. The combination of glycine and bovine lactoferrin was tested in the collagen-induced arthritis mice model. Intervention with glycine and bovine lactoferrin results in a decrease in TNF-alpha and IL-6 cytokine serum levels and more importantly inhibition of arthritis development. The studied nutraceuticals are interesting candidates for the development of cartilage protective or anti-inflammatory agents for treatment of chronic inflammatory joint diseases such as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Treating HIV in rural South Africa “Successes and Challenges\"'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['This thesis presents the first testimony of a unique collaboration between Ndlovu Medical Centre (NMC) in Elandsdoorn, South Africa, and the University Medical Centre in Utrecht (UMCU), The Netherlands. Sub-Saharan Africa continues to be the region most affected by HIV, and South Africa is the country with the highest number of HIV-infected individuals. Fortunately, global access to antiretroviral treatment (ART) has improved considerably. Over the last decade, many ART programmes took off, treating millions of HIV-infected patients. However, monitoring and research facilities in LICs still lag behind. NMC is one of the clinics providing HIV-care in South Africa. The clinic is unique due to the provision of extensive counselling and laboratory monitoring to all patients. The aim of this thesis was to evaluate the virological efficacy of NMC’s ART programme. Moreover, some general HIV-care related issues, such as co-infections, are addressed. The first part of this thesis reviews available virological data of Sub-Saharan African ART programmes. In the following chapters (part two) we analyse the outcome data of NMC’s HIV-treatment programme. On treatment results were excellent; patients gained weight, had a significant increase in their CD4+ T-cell counts and most reached virological suppression. Achieving such results is an impressive accomplishment, but early mortality was high, negatively influencing intention-to-treat results. Virological failure was observed during follow-up in 15% of adults and 40% of children. In case of a sub-optimal virological response, the virus can select drug-resistance mutations. Such mutations can limit future treatment options. We therefore sought to determine common drug-resistance profiles in patients experiencing treatment failure (part three). First-line ART in African treatment programmes generally consists of a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), combined with two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). As a result, resistance profiles typically showed the lamivudine-associated M184V mutation and multiple NNRTI-associated mutations at first detection of virological failure. These data suggest that many NRTIs (excluding lamivudine) may still be effective. However, we later show that an accumulation of NRTI-associated mutations can occur when first-line drugs are continued in spite of ongoing viral replication. This is worrisome; especially as such high-level resistance will frequently stay unnoticed due to the limited virological monitoring in most African clinics. In part four, we address some issues regarding important opportunistic infections. We reviewed the potential of a new diagnostic test for tuberculosis (interferon-gamma-release-assay, IGRA) in a setting where both HIV and TB are highly endemic. Unfortunately IGRAs seem to have limited value in such a setting due to their lack of discrimination between latent and active infections and for financial and logistic reasons. Subsequently, we determined hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) prevalence-rates. Both hepatitis viruses are highly prevalent in Africa, but there are large regional differences. An exceptionally low prevalence of active HBV was observed at the NMC. Occult HBV infections on the other hand were observed in a substantial proportion of HIV-infected individuals. To conclude (part five), we describe successes achieved in global HIV-care, and the challenges that remain for the future.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Intervening in intersexualization: the clinic and the colony'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['This dissertation intervenes into the process of intersexualization by focusing on specific moments in history in which anthropological, bio-medical and psychological accounts produce the issue of hermaphroditism/‘intersexuality’. Moreover, this dissertation examines underlying tropes, which merge in the power/knowledge complex that makes surgical intervention seem necessary in intersexualization. On the one hand, it shows how this process is immersed in binary categories like female/male, hetero- and homosexuality, normality/abnormality, civilized/savage, same/other. On the other hand, it depicts how these categories are reinstalled in the development and application of the category of ‘intersexuality’ in non-Western cultures. The central focus of this dissertation is the interrogation of the work of researchers from the United States namely John Money, Robert Stoller, Gilbert Herdt, Julian Davidson and Julianne Imperato-McGinley. Their contribution to the process of intersexualization is put into the context of their backgrounds, disciplinary training, collaborations, disagreements and referencing systems. I argue that it is not ‘intersexuality’ that is the phenomenon; rather the knowledge production and the treatment paradigm which resulted from the creation of ‘intersexuality’ as a medical category is the phenomenon. In the first section on The Clinic the focus is on John Money’s and Robert Stoller’s references to Freudian psychoanalysis in their attempts to define and determine categories such as gender, gender role, gender identity and sex and the treatment paradigm which followed from this. I argue that the gender-concept invented in the process of intersexualization essentializes what has been defined as sex and gender. Furthermore, I show how the corpus of work I am researching is firmly located in a patriarchal and heteronormative framework that sheds light on the wider societal and cultural organization of sex and gender. By mapping out the creation of subcategories such as gender role and gender identity I suggest that Money’s and Stoller’s research serves to essentialize a heterorelational sex-gender-sexuality-system on a biological as well as a psychological level. I argue that the notion of a ‘naturally’ bisex( ualiz)ed/gendered organization of human beings can only be uphold by the intersexualization of bodies and identities through surgical intervention. Furthermore, I will explore the work of feminist critical sex studies scholars, in particular Anne Fausto- Sterling’s proposal of the Five Sexes in regards to intersexualization. Critical feminist intervention into the essentialization of the body and sexual difference are also reviewed. In the second section on the Colony, I examine the cross-cultural process of intersexualization in anthropology. The researchers who are of central interest are Gilbert Herdt, Robert Stoller, Julian Davidson, and Julianne Imperato-McGinley. Their respective disciplines will be explored and put into their geo-political context. I analyze how the claim of a cross-cultural and universal ‘truth’ of ‘intersexuality’ derived from a cross-culturally expanded and exported desire to medicalize fostered the normalization of a binary organization of the sexes/genders through the construction of the ‘other’. I argue, that in the very subject of intersexualization tropes of civilization and the primitive, developed and naïve are in a neo-colonial manner combined with the categories of the Western sex-gender-sexuality system. Western systems of knowledge weave themselves into the interpretation of the ‘field’ and the referent of the West re-installs itself as the center and the Other as ‘lack’ always in relation to the West and its knowledge producers. Of special interest is the position of the researcher from the West who goes to other cultures and ‘looks’ and interprets, diagnoses and categorizes what s/he ‘sees’. The underlying features of this gaze are to be found in the pathologizing of not just the Other but also the sexuality of the other – the fifth other. This category has already widely been discussed in the analogies between sexualization and racialization/ethnicization but not yet adapted to the processes of intersexualization, which I undertake in this dissertation. Attention is also paid to the trope of the Third and its application in various contexts. This example is used to draw attention to the neo-colonizing features of anthropological categorization of sex-gender-sexuality-systems, yet it is also used to reflect on possibilities of resistance. I also give insight into the historical organization of knowledge production in the West by looking at the origins of discourses such as sexology and psychoanalysis, which still show reminiscences in anthropological research contributing to cross-cultural intersexualization. I conclude that the process of cross-cultural intersexualization is reflected in the distinction between sex and gender and the medicalizing Western gaze upon the other, which creates and normalizes the other according to the Western heterorelational system. I also ponder on a possible reconfiguration of history, knowledge production and the future in intersexualization.'],\n",

       "  'Description': [\"The book ''The Accountability of European Agencies: Legal Provisions and Ongoing Practices '' addresses one of the most relevant yet under- researched topic in current European governance: the accountability of European agencies. European agencies have been created at a rapid pace in recent years, in a multitude of highly pertinent and sensitive fields ranging from pharmaceuticals and food safety to chemicals or aviation safety. These bodies, meant to operate at arm’s length from political control, have real power and their opinions and decisions can have a direct impact on individuals, regulators and member states. Are these bodies held to account or are we faced with the threat of powerful and unaccountable institutional actors? This book investigates how the accountability system of European agencies operates at both the formal level as well as in practice. In doing so, it zooms in on five European agencies: EMEA (the European Medicines Agency), EASA (the European Aviation Safety Agency), OHIM (the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market), Europol and Eurojust. The analysis spans four different accountability regimes: managerial, political, financial and (quasi-)legal, thus examining agency accountability vis-୶is multiple forums such as: management boards, the European Parliament, the Council, the European Court of Auditors, the European Court of Justice etc. It follows a multi-disciplinary approach and is at the cutting edge of public administration and law. Through a systematic analysis of both the law and the practice of agency accountability, the book unravels these complex accountability regimes and pinpoints exactly where failures occur. Whereas agencies are subject to extensive accountability arrangements, underuse is prevalent. Accountability forums often fail to exercise in practice, the formal powers at their disposal vis-୶is agencies. Furthermore, accountability arrangements are frequently poorly designed, thus negatively impacting their effectiveness. More generally, the book also offers insights into aspects of agency governance and design as well as important theoretical insights into the conceptualization and the study of accountability.\"],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a form of motor neuron disease, is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterised by the selective loss of motor neurons in the cortex, brainstem and spinal cord. Patients suffer from progressive wasting and weakness of limb, bulbar and respiratory muscles, and die on average within 3 years of symptom onset, usually because of respiratory failure. Although ALS can occur anytime during adulthood, the median age of onset is in the mid-fifties. The only therapeutic strategy to slow progression of ALS is currently riluzole, which delays disease development by 3 to 6 months. Global incidence of ALS is about 1 – 2 per 100,000 and lifetime risk of developing ALS is estimated to be 1/600 – 1/2000, which makes it the most common motor neuron disease. About 10% of patients have a family history of ALS (FALS). Over ten different subtypes of FALS are distinguished and mutation in SOD1, ANG, FUS, VAPB and TARDBP have identified. The remaining 90% of ALS cases are sporadic, and are thought to be multifactorial, with both environmental and genetic components contributing to disease susceptibility. On the basis of concordance rates in twin studies, estimates of the heritability of ALS range from 0.38 to 0.85. The aim of this thesis is to confirm and identify novel genetic risk factors for familial and sporadic ALS by performing candidate gene studies and genome-wide association studies. Mutation analysis in Dutch familial ALS patients demonstrated that SOD1 mutations (found in approximately 20% of familial ALS patients) are very rare in The Netherlands, demonstrating genetic heterogeneity of the disease. We further demonstrate segregation of the ANG K17I mutation with disease in a pedigree with FALS. One affected family member was initially diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease, but went on to develop ALS and frontotemporal dementia. This thesis further describes multiple genome-wide association studies in sporadic ALS, in which genetic variation in ITPR2, DPP6, UNC13A and a locus on chromosome 9p are identified as susceptibility factors. We also show that common genetic variation in KIFAP3 is associated with prolonged survival in ALS. Patients who are homozygous for the associated allele have 14.0 month survival advantage. Using a candidate gene approach we show that rare mutation in ANG confer a large risk for both ALS and Parkinson’s disease (odds ratio > 25.0). We also show elevated serum levels in of angiogenin in ALS, but not PD patients.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Mps1 kinase signaling in mitosis'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Chromosomal instability (CIN), a feature widely shared by cells from solid tumors, is caused by occasional chromosome missegregations during cell division. Maintenance of chromosomal stability relies on coordination between various processes that are critical for proper chromosome segregation in mitosis. Equal segregation of chromosomes during cell division depends on a coordinated effort to attach and align all chromosomes on the metaphase plate (biorientation) before onset of anaphase. The mitotic checkpoint halts cell-cycle progression until all paired sister chromatids are bioriented and aligned on the metaphase plate. The mitotic checkpoint responds to lack of attachment of kinetochores to spindle microtubules or lack of tension between kinetochores of sister chromatids, and depends on several kinases including Bub1, BubR1, and Mps1. Loss of checkpoint function results in gross chromosome missegregations and eventually cell death. However, increased rates of CIN in cells derived from human tumors have been reported. It has been suggested through several in vivo model systems that weakening of the mitotic checkpoint contributes to carcinogenesis, or may even induce spontaneous tumor formation. Since tumor cells cycle very rapidly, the mitotic checkpoint is an interesting target for cancer treatment. Additionally, the CIN phenotype may sensitize cells to cell death by induction of extra chromosome missegregations through mitotic checkpoint inhibition. This could potentially result in selective killing of CIN tumors, while sparing healthy tissue. A possible downside to this approach is that partial inhibition could sensitize healthy tissue to tumorigenesis, or even induce tumor formation. It is therefore important to study the mechanism of checkpoint functioning extensively. The research described in this thesis focuses on Mps1 biology since Mps1 is an evolutionary conserved protein with a conserved essential function in the mitotic checkpoint. The fact that Mps1 is a protein kinase makes it a candidate contributor to amplification of the checkpoint signal and its activity could enable a faster switch from an active checkpoint to silencing of the checkpoint compared to for example protein degradation or translation events. With regards to cancer, Mps1 could be a good therapeutic target, especially because it is a kinase that can potentially be inhibited in the patient through administration of an inhibitory chemical compound. At the onset of the studies described in this thesis, not much was known about the upstream regulation and downstream signaling of Mps1. The work presented in this thesis provides new mechanistic insights on Mps1 signaling in the mitotic checkpoint and reveals a function of Mps1 in coordinating chromosome biorientation and the mitotic checkpoint. Many aspects of mitotic checkpoint signaling and the precise role of Mps1 herein however remain to be uncovered. Our findings contribute to the basis for future fundamental research in the field of mitosis and mitotic checkpoint signaling, and to further possibilities to explore the mitotic checkpoint as a possible target for cancer treatment.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Pharmacotherapy and aggressive behaviour in psychiat r ic pat ients'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Aggressive behaviour is an important problem in mental health care. Aggressive behaviour does not only affect staff and other patients, but also has a negative impact on the patient himself. Studies have shown that aggressive patients are admitted on psychiatric wards longer compared to non-aggressive patients. In psychiatric wards, several interventions are used to manage aggressive behaviour. In the Netherlands, seclusion has for decades been a highly common intervention to manage (imminent) aggression. During recent years, however, the use of seclusion has been heavily criticized. Pharmacotherapy is another commonly used intervention, which is viewed by many as a potential alternative for the management of aggressive behaviour. In this thesis, we focused on the evidence available from clinical trials for the pharmacological management of aggressive behaviour, and juxtaposed that against clinical practice. We systematically searched the literature for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the pharmacological management of aggression. For the acute situation, both benzodiazepines and antipsychotics appeared to be effective. Weak evidence for anti-aggressive effects of antipsychotics, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and ?-adrenergic–blocking drugs in maintenance treatment was found. However, RCTs have important methodological limitations, including small study samples, short study durations and strict in-and exclusion criteria. We observed that patients enrolled in RCTs differ greatly from psychiatric patients that are seen in clinical practice for whom aggression is a severe problem. Only 30% to 46% of aggressive psychiatric patients as seen in clinical practice would be eligible to participate in a typical randomized controlled trial based on the most frequently applied exclusion criteria. The comparability of RCTs to clinical practice, and probably also the generalizability, therefore is judged to be low. We investigated medication patterns in relation to aggressive behaviour on psychiatric wards. Despite limited evidence for effectiveness of pharmacological treatment of aggressive behaviour, the conducted observational studies showed that aggressive patients in daily clinical practice use more medication compared to non-aggressive patients: new psychotropics were started more frequently and dosages were more likely to be increased. Furthermore, aggressive patients have an increased use of both psychotropic and somatic as-needed medication. For severely aggressive patients, compared to non-aggressive patients, as-needed medication was more frequently administered on the basis of the nurse’s initiative, instead of the patient’s own initiative. Interestingly, the perceived time of onset of effect of medication was significantly shorter in the perception of the patients compared to the nurses. We hypothesized that apart from pharmacological effects there also appears to be a placebo-effect. Overall, we concluded that difficult behaviour such as aggression, triggers reactive prescribing behaviour. With regard to treatment outcome, defined as a transfer to a more open (positive outcome) or a (more) closed ward (negative outcome), we found that aggressive patients using psychotropic polypharmacy were at highest risk for a negative treatment outcome. Considering this, together with the lack of evidence for the (pharmacological) management of aggressive behaviour we recommend to record aggressive behaviour during admission. Such registrations will facilitate the evaluation of the effects of (pharmacological) interventions aimed at reducing aggression. Furthermore analyses of patterns of aggression of individual patients may provide clues to improve treatment and management of aggressive behaviour.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The development of analytical methods for the quantification of peptides in biological matrices has become increasingly important with the continuously growing attention for these large bio-molecules in all kinds of biomedical research. For example, endogenous peptides often serve as templates for the development of novel (peptidic) therapeutic compounds, while their roles in physiological processes are extensively explored for applications in disease (pre) diagnosis. In recent years, liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) has developed into one of the most valuable analytical techniques that could overcome most problems generally associated with the bioanalysis of peptides, as it allows highly sensitive and specific analyses. The suitability of LC-MS/MS for the quantification of peptides in biological matrices has been overviewed in the introduction of this thesis, which thereafter focuses on the development and validation of various LC-MS/MS methods for different types of peptides, including peptide drugs, endogenous bioactive peptides and peptide fragments from endogenous blood proteins. The developed methods have been used for the absolute quantification of the specific peptides in clinical serum samples to evaluate their potential as serum markers for different types of cancer. For example, the antimicrobial human neutrophil peptides-1, -2 and -3 (HNP-1, 2 and -3) were quantified in serum samples from colorectal cancer patients. The developed LC-MS/MS method allowed for the first time simultaneous quantification of individual concentrations of these three structurally almost similar peptides and revealed significantly up-regulated serum concentrations of HNP-1 and -2 in colorectal cancer patients compared to serum from colonoscopy-assessed controls. Furthermore, two different LC-MS/MS methods were developed for the absolute quantification of proteolytic peptide fragments from common blood proteins, which have previously been postulated as exhibiting diagnostic information for the detection of different types of cancer. The suitability and importance of the developed LC-MS/MS methods was shown by the measurement of clinical serum samples from breast cancer patients and matched controls. These analyses showed significantly up-regulated serum concentrations in breast cancer for des-Arg9-bradykinin, a metabolite from bradykinin, and for several peptides derived from the blood protein inter alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain 4 (ITIH4). Moreover, serum concentrations of the up-regulated peptides were significantly decreased after surgical removal of the breast cancer tumor, indicating the potential of these peptides in the follow-up of breast cancer. The developed LC-MS/MS methods were further exploited to more specifically investigate the influence of pre-analytical factors on the serum concentrations of the different peptide fragments, required for future studies to finally elucidate the role of these peptides in different types of cancer and their potential as cancer biomarkers.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Cushing`s syndrome or hypercortisolism is one of the most common endocrinopathies in dogs. Besides the ACTH or pituitary-dependent and adrenal or ACTH-independent hypercortisolism, ectopic ACTH secretion and food-dependent hypercortisolism are described in the dog for the very first time. Ectopic ACTH secretion has been diagnosed in a dog in which initially pituitary microadenoma was diagnosed and since the hypophysectomy was not curative, further diagnostic has been performed. CRH stimulation test revealed no respons of plasma ACTH and cortisol concentrations, which was strongly indicative of ectopic ACTH secretion syndrome. Total body CT scan revealed a mass in the pancreas and during the celiotomy, also some nodular changes in the liver were noted. Pathohistological examination confirmed pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, which is a common origin of the ectopic ACTH secretion syndrome in men. Food-dependent hypercortisolism has been diagnosed in a dog with mild clinical signs of hypercortisolism, suppressed plasma ACTH concentrations and bilateral enlarged adrenal glands. UCCR increased after ingestion of the meal. Treatment with ocreotide, which suppresses release of gastric-inhibitory polypeptide (GIP), blocked cortisol secretion, while plasma ACTH concentration remained suppressed. Treatment with trilostane was successful only when trilostane was administered before ingestion of the meal, which provided an additional information for food-dependent hypercortisolism in this dog. The differentiation between ACTH-dependent and ACTH-independent hypercortisolism can be done by the measurements of the urinary corticoid:creatinine ratio (UCCR) combined with the high dose dexamethasone suppression test. The generally-accepted criterion of 50% suppression of plasma cortisol concentration in the differentiation between pituitary or adrenal hypercortisolism is also applicable to the UCCR. Although the UCCR is very reliable in the diagnostics of hypercortisolism, it cannot be used to detect the optimal dose of trilostane. However, the measurement of the UCCR could be useful to detect dogs at risk of developing hypocortisolism. Similar holds true for the basal ACTH concentration, which significantly increased in dogs which received trilostane overdose when compared to dogs receiving the optimal dose. There was no overlap in plasma ACTH concentration in dogs on the optimal dose when compared to dogs which received an overdose. Obviously, trilostane affected the pituitary-adrenal axis. In addition, also an effect at renin-aldosterone system has been detected, since the aldosterone:renin ratio significantly decreased during treatment with trilostane. The pathogenesis of the adrenocortical tumors in dogs is poorly understood. In humans, cortisol-secreting adenomas could be initiated by the aberrant expression of hormonal receptors. In the dog, the overexpression of the genes coding for luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR), gastric-inhibitory polypeptide receptor (GIPR) and three vasopressine receptors (V1aR, V1bR and V2R) was not responsible for the hypersecretion of cortisol by the adrenocortical tumor. However, ectopic expression of GIPR and V2R protein, and eutopic expression of LHR protein in tumorous ZF tissue, may play a role in the pathogenesis of canine cortisol-secreting ATs. Hypercortisolemia in dogs with cortisol-secreting ATs cannot be ascribed to upregulation of the genes encoding for steroidogenic enzymes. In adrenocortical carcinomas, there was a significant downregulation of ACTH-R, which may contribute to the malignant character of cortisol-secreting carcinomas'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The pharmacological management of motor and non-motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the central theme of this thesis. In a literature study, we revealed that relatively few efforts have been made to investigate the role of pharmacogenetics in the response to anti-PD drugs and that only few replication studies have been performed. Some interesting associations between genetic variants and anti-PD drug response have been found, but these were conflicting. We concluded that pharmacogenetic polymorphisms should not be assessed routinely or exceptionally during the clinical management of PD. We compared patient characteristics and the incidence of discontinuation of two non-ergoline DA, ropinirole and pramipexole, between a retrospective clinical practice cohort with PD and data from randomized clinical trials (RCTs). We concluded that the overall incidence of discontinuation of ropinirole and pramipexole between the patients in our clinical-practice cohort and patients in the RCTs was comparable for the short term. In a retrospective cohort study we identified non-genetic and genetic determinants for the discontinuation of non-ergoline DA treatment in patients with PD. Apomorphine use and levodopa dosages between 500 and 1000 mg were positively associated with discontinuation. The absence of a 15x CA repeat allele in the dopamine receptor 2 gene was significantly associated with a decreased discontinuation of non-ergoline treatment. We concluded that more research is needed to replicate these findings. In a case-control study we investigated the association between the use of DA and hospitalization due to ischemic events in patients with PD. We concluded that DA use one year prior to the index date was not associated with a higher risk of ischemic events requiring hospitalization. In a case-control study we studied the effect of dopaminergic medication and concomitant use of psychotropics on the risk of hip/femur fractures. Current use of dopaminergic drugs was associated with a nearly two-fold increased risk of hip/femur fractures compared to never use, but this excess risk rapidly dropped to baseline levels when treatment had been discontinued >1 year ago. Concomitant use of antidepressants among current dopaminergic drug users further increased the risk of hip/femur fractures. We concluded that fracture risk assessment may be warranted in elderly users of dopaminergic drugs. In a retrospective cohort study we assessed whether there is an association between initial use of serotonergic antidepressants and changes in anti-PD drug treatment. We concluded that there is no evidence to be more cautious using SSRIs or serotonergic antidepressants compared to other antidepressants in patients with PD. We determined the efficacy and safety of glycopyrrolate in the treatment of sialorrhea in patients with PD during a 4-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial. Nine patients (39.1%) with glycopyrrolate had a clinically relevant improvement of at least 30% versus 1 patient (4.3%) with placebo (p=0.021). There were no significant differences in adverse events between glycopyrrolate and placebo treatment. We concluded that oral glycopyrrolate 1 mg three times daily is an effective and safe therapy for sialorrhea PD'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Neuroprotective strategies for the neonatal brain after hypoxia-ischemia : pharmacological interventions and hypothermia'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['In Chapter 1 the possible mechanisms and the current promising neuroprotective strategies after neonatal hypoxia-ischemic (HI) brain injury have been summarized. Based on the mechanisms, therapies should be concentrated on inhibition of the production of reactive oxygen species or free radicals, anti-inflammation and anti-apoptosis in the early stage (first 6h after birth) while on stimulation of neurotrophic properties in a later stage. Combination of moderate hypothermia and pharmacological interventions is probably the next step of consideration. One important factor playing a role in brain injury is the hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha). During neonatal HI, HIF-1alpha protein expression is stabilized so that it can regulate the expression of several target genes, such as erythropoietin (EPO), which plays a role in neuronal cell survival and death. In Chapter 2, the role and regulation of HIF-1alpha in neonatal HI is summarized, and several possible pathways are described that are involved in promoting the neuroprotective effect of HIF-1alpha via inducing expression of the neurotrophic target genes while inhibiting its neurotoxic effects which increase the level of the pro-apoptotic protein p53. The neuroprotective properties of EPO have been reported, but contradicting evidence with respect to its efficacy exists. In Chapter 3, the effect of EPO treatment on short-and long-term outcome after HI was investigated in a p9 mice model. EPO showed to improve sensorimotor function and white matter damage, but did not reduce grey matter lesion volume. Furthermore, EPO also enhanced proliferation of progenitor cells in the brain. However, these modest neuroprotective effects were shown to be both dose-dependent and gender-dependent. In the present study, only female mice benefited from EPO after HI when treated with 5kU/kg (EPO). Moderate hypothermia is the only method available today for asphyxiated term newborns with moderate encephalopathy that has shown to have a modest neuroprotective effect provided the therapy is started within 6h after birth. Only 1 out of 9 children benefits from this intervention. In Chapter 4 and 5, the potential neuroprotective effects of 3h hypothermia was tested in a p7 rat HI model. With hypothermia alone (Chapter 4), the improvement of sensorimotor function and reduction in brain lesion were found only in females. We checked whether the combination of hypothermia and EPO improved the efficacy of the treatment instead of applying EPO alone in Chapter 5. However, no synergic or additive effect of the hypothermia-EPO combination was found in females. In males there was only a short-lasting improvement of sensorimotor function after the combined therapy of hypothermia and EPO in males, which disappeared after 3 weeks. Apoptosis is thought to play an important role in neonatal HI brain damage. Neuronal p53 acts as a transcription factor for various pro-apoptotic molecules. Moreover, it has a direct effect on mitochondria. In Chapter 6, pifithrin-mu, a p53 inhibitor, was administrated to the p7 rat after HI. Pifithrin-mu completely prevented the HI-induced transport of p53 to the mitochondria resulting in improved sensorimotor and cognitive function and in a profound reduction in brain lesion'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['The long term prognosis of patients with peripheral arterial disease after infrainguinal bypass surgery : the follow-up of the Dutch Bypass and Oral anticoagulants or Aspirin Study'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a major public health burden with a prevalence of approximately 27 million people in Europe and North America. PAD is characterised by a progressive narrowing or occlusion of the major arteries in the lower limbs as a result of atherosclerosis. Because atherosclerosis is a systemic disease, patients with PAD are at high risk of lower limb complications and of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular ischaemic events. Despite the growing awareness that PAD is an important marker of generalized atherosclerosis, its systemic consequences are still underestimated and undertreated in comparison with coronary artery disease or cerebrovascular disease. To raise awareness and improve secondary prevention, this thesis focussed on the long-term prognosis of patients with PAD who were treated with infrainguinal bypass surgery. Our primary aim was to quantify the risk of ischaemic complications throughout the whole arterial tree up to 10 years after bypass surgery and elucidate its determinants. Data on fatal and non-fatal vascular events that occurred between 1995 and 2009 were recorded in nearly 500 patients who had participated in the Dutch Bypass and Oral anticoagulants or Aspirin (BOA) Study (The Lancet 2000;355:346-351). The follow-up data were complete in 94% of patients and enabled us to give a fairly accurate insight in the long-term course of PAD and to produce an easy to use tool to determine a patient’s vascular risk profile. This so called BOA Risk Chart helps to predict a patient’s long-term prognosis quickly and effortlessly without the need for any additional testing. Furthermore, we studied the former and currently applied drug treatments (i.e. antithrombotic, antihypertensive, and lipid lowering drugs) and cardiovascular risk management in PAD patients after they underwent peripheral bypass surgery. Both the results of our international survey among vascular surgeons throughout Europe and of our drug registration over the past decade in a sample of patients from the Dutch BOA study showed an improvement in the application of secondary prevention therapy, but also for it to remain far from optimal. Although these results should be interpreted with caution because of possible selection and survival bias, they do underline the frequently reported undertreatment of patients with PAD. Lately, bleeding –the main adverse effect of antithrombotic therapy– is reported to lead to a four- to five-fold or even a nine-fold increase in the risk of death, myocardial infarction, or ischaemic stroke in patient with coronary artery disease or cerebrovascular disease. As this association has not been reported in PAD patients before, we studied the consequences of bleeding in patients with PAD from the Dutch BOA Study and again in a pooled dataset of the Dutch BOA Study and the Warfarin Antiplatelet Vascular Evaluation (WAVE) Trial (N Engl J Med 2007;357:217-227). Our results confirmed the previous findings of non-fatal major bleeding being independently associated with a three-fold increased risk of new ischaemic events. Further research is required to elucidate the causal underlying mechanism of this new association. Until then, the prevention of bleeding is equally important as the prevention of ischaemic events. Finally, in daily life the prognosis after peripheral bypass surgery is determined by a patient’s perception of health, rather than by clinical risk estimates. Therefore we studied the changes in patients’ health related quality of life (HR-QoL) after peripheral bypass surgery over time. Their HR-QoL was substantially impaired in comparison with the HR-QoL of the general population at the same mean age, even if the patient had a patent graft or experienced no other vascular event during follow-up. Over time their HR-QoL worsened, mainly their physical health, and especially after the occurrence of a vascular event. Given that peripheral bypass cannot prevent the HR-QoL in patients with PAD to deteriorate over time, atherosclerotic risk management through lifestyle modifications and drug treatments might be just as important to stabilise the HR-QoL for as long as possible. In conclusion, PAD is a major public health burden, not only because PAD has a high prevalence and a progressive pathology, but especially because its the long term systemic consequences are largely disabling and currently largely underestimated.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Dementia is a growing problem in industrialized countries. With the prolonged life expectancy the size of the older population will grow considerably. With rising age, the prevalence and incidence of dementia will increase exponentially. It is estimated that the prevalence of dementia doubles every five years after the age of 60 and that the overall incidence rate of dementia in people over 90 years of age is as high as 18% per year. Dementia is characterized by progressive cognitive impairment as well as non-cognitive symptoms such as mood and personality changes. One of the first structures to be affected in dementia is the hippocampus. The hippocampus, consisting of the ammon’s horn, the dentate gyrus and subiculum, is part of the medial temporal lobe. It belongs to the limbic systems and is involved in episodic memory. Several studies have shown that the hippocampal volume loss is associated with cognitive decline in nondemented populations. The last past decades there have been considerable advances in the understanding of Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias, however, to date no fully effective treatments and preventive strategies have been found. Early identification and institution of preventive measures for risk factors predisposing to cognitive decline are of high priority. It is important to further unravel the etiology of Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias to gain insight into mechanisms that cause the disease enabling development of preventive and curative strategies. In this thesis we investigated the age-related changes in hippocampal volumes in non- demented elderly. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of ischemia, hypoxia and high levels of glucocorticoids as risk factors that have been suggested to be particular detrimental for the hippocampus.

Background: Many rehabilitation researchers have emphasized the need to examine the actual contents of rehabilitation programmes. One key component of these contents is the therapy provided. Mobility and self-care are the main domains of rehabilitation of people with an Spinal Cord Injury (SCI). Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and sports interventions contribute to the improvement of mobility and self-care among people with SCI. To date, the majority of SCI therapy interventions is still based on ‘expert opinion’. To identify effective treatments or to improve the quality of treatments, treatments need to be described in detail by means of uniform concepts and language. Main aims of the thesis: To develop a classification system representing all clinical interventions provided by physical therapists, occupational therapists and sports therapists and aiming at the improvement of mobility and self-care in people with an SCI, which can be used in a valid and reliable way for research and clinical practice, and which is site-neutral and cross-cultural. To describe and compare the contents of treatment in different rehabilitation centres and in different countries. Methods: We developed the Spinal Cord Injury-Interventions Classification System (SCI-ICS) from the ‘International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF)’, clinical practice, SCI literature, and stroke literature. To examine the completeness, feasibility, validity, and reliability we performed a consensus procedure, a feasibility, and reliability study involving Dutch therapists from specialized rehabilitation centres. Following these three studies we compared the therapy provided to 79 people with a recent SCI undergoing inpatient treatment in 3 rehabilitation centres in the Netherlands, 1 in Australia and 1 in Norway during the same 4 consecutive weeks. To obtain evidence for the English-language version of the SCI-ICS the Australian and Norwegian therapists repeated the reliability study. Results: The final version of the SCI-ICS comprises a hierarchical structure with 3 levels (body functions, basic activities and complex activities), 25 categories (e.g., muscle power, walking, and dressing) and 139 grouped interventions. We showed that the SCI-ICS is a valid, reliable and feasible instrument to record interventions intended to improve the mobility and self-care of people with SCI by the 3 disciplines in different countries. We reported on the distribution of SCI therapy over different domains of functioning for the first time, especially mobility and self-care, based on direct collection of clinical treatment data in 5 rehabilitation centres, and found mostly similarities between treatment programmes within the Netherlands, but differences in treatment between the Netherlands, Australia and Norway. Conclusions: Using the SCI-ICS allows data on actually provided therapy to be obtained, in clinical practice or for research purposes. These data might enable us to adjust and improve effective and efficient clinical decision making in therapy programmes for people with an SCI, and might facilitate comparisons of therapies between settings and countries'],\n",

       "  'Description': [\"Helper T cells play an important role in determining the outcome of an immune response. Helper T cells of distinct phenotypes induce different immune responses by producing distinct cytokines. The phenotype of a helper T cell and the production of the corresponding cytokine(s) is determined by so-called `master transcription factors', and is subsequently fixed and maintained by epigenetic modification of the cytokine locus. We formulated a mechanistic mathematical model describing master transcription factor dynamics, and show that self-activation of the master transcription factor, together with the formation of heterodimeric complexes, explains the polarization of helper T cells into multiple phenotypes. We extended our model to include cell division and the dynamics of cytokine expression and cytokine locus epigenetics. The extended model was used it to investigate the role of stochasticity in adopting and maintaining cytokine expression. We show that cell division opens up the cytokine locus by diluting CpG methylation. Surprisingly, stochasticity reduces the time needed by a cell to express cytokine. To investigate the changes that helper T cells undergo at the mRNA level, we applied microarray-assisted gene profiling to {\\\\it ex vivo} skewed mouse splenocytes. Principle component analysis of our own data showed that the most important sources of variance in helper T cell differentiation are 1) activation, 2) time since activation, and 3) polarization into Th phenotypes. To identify genes that are specific for a particular Th phenotype, we constructed a novel non-supervised scoring method called `Polar Score', which finds the rare genes that are differentially regulated due to Th skewing, in a sea of genes upregulated by T cell activation. We apply the Polar Score method to publically available data, and identify candidate master regulators for the recently described Th9 phenotype. Additionally, we use our own data to identify genes that we expect to be related the Th1 and Th2 phenotypes. The specific cytokines produced by helper T lymphocytes and other cells determine the type of immune response that is raised. This suggests that cytokines measured {\\\\it in situ} could be employed to reveal the type of immune response. By applying cluster analysis to immunoassay multiplex cytokine measurements of a cohort of controls and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), rheumatoid arthritis, osteo arthritis, and diabetes patients, we show that different autoimmune diseases can be recognised by their distinct cytokine patterns. Because several cytokines are co-expressed, suggesting that they are co-regulated, these results call for further analysis of the time courses of gene expression during helper T cell differentiation\"],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Protein modification by ubiquitin conjugation (ubiquitination) is responsible for degradation of most cellular proteins, and therefore is crucial to most aspects of eukaryotic cells. Numerous diseases, including hypoxia, inflammatory diseases, muscle wasting disorders and cancer, were discovered to be affected by aberrations in the ubiquitin system. Ubiquitination is a highly regulated system carried out by complex processes through the hierarchical E1-E2-E3 enzyme cascade, which involves thousands of enzymes and substrates in human cells. The detailed molecular mechanisms underlying these complex processes, the specificity of E1-E2, E2-E3, and E3-substrate recognition are poorly understood. In this thesis, we describes the protein production of E3 RING domain, and structural and functional studies on the interaction network of E2 conjugating enzymes: the complexes of the E3 ligase c-Cbl RING with the E2 enzyme UbcH5b and that with UbcH7, and the complexes of the E2 Rad6b with the RING E3 Rad18 and ubiquitin. The E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes UbcH7 and UbcH5B both show specific binding to the RING domain of the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase c-Cbl, but UbcH7 hardly supports ubiquitination of c-Cbl and substrate in a reconstituted system. We found that neither structural changes nor subtle differences in the E2-E3 interaction surface are possible explanations for the functional specificity of UbcH5B and UbcH7 in their interaction with c-Cbl. The quick transfer of ubiquitin from the UbcH5B~Ub thioester to c-Cbl or other ubiquitin acceptors suggests that UbcH5B might functionally be a relatively pliable E2 enzyme. In contrast, the UbcH7~Ub thioester is too stable to transfer ubiquitin under our assay conditions, indicating that UbcH7 might be a more specific E2 enzyme. Our results imply that the interaction specificity between c-Cbl and E2 is required, but not sufficient for transfer of ubiquitin to potential targets. In ubiquitin conjugation, different combinations of E2 and E3 enzymes catalyze either monoubiquitination or ubiquitin chain formation. Conjugation enzymes Rad6/Rad18 only monoubiquitinate PCNA to signal for ‘error prone’ DNA damage tolerance. Ubiquitin chain formation on PCNA is catalyzed by a different set of conjugation enzymes: Ubc13/MMS2/Rad5. Here we studied the structure of E3 Rad18 RING-RING symmetric dimer determined by X-ray, and the Rad18 RING dimers can bind two Rad6b E2 enzymes. In contrast, binding studies of full-length Rad18 homodimer with Rad6b show that Rad18 homodimer can bind only to a single Rad6b enzyme. Till now, the functional role of this asymmetry E3 dimers found in not only heterodimeric E3 ligases but also the homodimeric U-box E3 CHIP and RING E3 Rad18 is poor understood. Furthermore, we show that E2 enzyme Rad6 is intrinsically capable of ubiquitin chain formation. The specificity of the reaction is provided by E3 enzyme Rad18, which prevents the chain-formation activity to direct the reaction towards monoubiquitination. The R6BD of Rad18 provides the inhibition by competing with ubiquitin for a non-covalent ‘backside’ binding site on Rad6. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into how E3 enzymes can regulate the ubiquitin conjugation process.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The mechano growth factor (MGF) is expressed in mechanically overloaded skeletal muscle. MGF was discovered in 1996 as an alternative splice product of the IGF-1 gene. Since then, its significance has been investigated particularly in skeletal muscle, because the local expression of MGF could provide an explanation for the specific hypertrophy of overloaded muscle. In the present thesis, regulation of MGF in skeletal muscle and heart was investigated, and compared with that of IGF-1Ea. The first experimental Chapter shows that a single bout of 15 min of lengthening contractions initiates a number of various molecular responses in isolated mouse skeletal muscle, independent of any circulating systemic factor. Simultaneously with contraction-induced MGF mRNA expression, genes like MyoD and PCNA were induced suggesting the activation muscle stem cells. The subsequently observed mRNA expression of IGF-1Ea might stimulate differentiation of muscle stem cells into myotubes. At that time PCNA mRNA is no longer expressed is, indicating stem cells are no longer in the S-phase. Because MGF was induced in skeletal muscle by mechanical loading, its expression in heart was investigated in a series of in vivo and in vitro experiments. In mice treated with thyroid hormone (T3) for 12 days to induce cardiac hypertrophy, cardiac MGF expression strongly correlated with the increased beating frequency in hyperthyroid mice. In contrast to skeletal muscle, MGF was constitutively expressed in the heart, may be as a result of its continuous activity. The in vivo observations were compared to heart cells exposed to T3 in culture. Upon T3 treatment, cardiomyocytes showed an increase in beats per minute, as well as increases in MGF and IGF-1Ea mRNA expression. Interestingly, when the T3-exposed cardiomyocytes were contractile arrested by KCl, up-regulation of MGF was not observed, whereas IGF-1Ea was still induced. These findings suggest that MGF is induced in mechanically stressed cardiomyocytes and potentially mediates the adaptive hypertrophic response towards thyroid hormone treatment. The next Chapter shows that expression of MGF increases during early cardiac embryonic development, decreases during postnatal development, and re-emerges shortly after acute myocardial infarction in adult mice. Since myocardial infarction results in an insufficient supply of oxygen and nutrition into the infarcted area, we evaluated the influence of hypoxia and starvation on MGF expression. We exposed cardiomyocyte cell cultures to desferrioxamine (DFO), which stabilizes hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), and found induction of MGF. In contrast, starvation of cardiomyocytes decreased MGF. These findings demonstrate that MGF is induced during embryonic development and upon ischemic injury of the heart, where hypoxia/HIF-activated pathways are likely to be important for MGF regulation, rather than nutritional shortage. In conclusion, the results presented in this thesis contribute to the understanding of the regulation of the Mechano Growth Factor. The final Chapter focuses on the possible beneficial effects of MGF on health. It addresses the issue whether MGF could be useful for a therapeutic approach in patients with muscle or heart diseases, as well as the (mis)use of MGF in sports.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['In multilevel research, the data structure in the population is hierarchical, and the sample data are viewed as a multistage sample from this hierarchical population. For instance in educational research, the population consists of schools and pupils within these schools. In this scenario, pupils are said to be nested within schools. In this dissertation we look at some issues in the analysis of hierarchical (multilevel) data using hierarchical linear models. The main focus is on hierarchical linear models with constraints on the model parameters. In Chapter 2, methods that can be used to test homogeneity in a random intercept model are presented. The chapter begins with a review of asymptotic, posterior predictive and plug-in p-values and it is shown how each of them can be computed. Four test quantities for testing the homogeneity of residual variances are presented. Thereafter two test quantities for testing the homogeneity of regression slopes are presented. Subsequently each test quantity is evaluated using asymptotic, posterior predictive and plug in p-values. A simulation study is used to investigate the frequency properties of these p-values. It is shown that discrepancy measures evaluated using either posterior predictive or plug-in p-values have both good ‘classical’ and ‘Bayesian’ frequency properties. This suggests that whenever homogeneity of residual variances and /or homogeneity of regression slopes are to be evaluated in the random intercept model, it is advisable to use discrepancy measures evaluated with either posterior predictive or plug-in p-values. Homogeneity in more complex hierarchical models can be investigated by natural extensions of what has been presented for the random intercept model. Researchers in most fields of study usually have several competing theories/expectations about the outcome(s) of their research. These theories may emanate from subject-area experts or from previous studies. In Chapter 3, we use classical statistics to investigate the tenability of the theories presented by the subject experts. Data from two projects in clinical psychology are presented and analysed. The analyses illustrate how the linear mixed model can be adapted and used to analyse structured repeated measurements. In Chapters 4 and 5, the statistical modelling takes into account the theories a researcher has with respect to the outcome of the investigation at hand. In Chapter 4, several issues are presented. First, we show that by putting constraints on the model parameters, competing theories can be translated into a set of competing models. A fully Bayesian approach is used to select the ‘best’ model from the set of competing models via the computation of posterior probabilities using a novel method which we denote the ‘method of encompassing priors’. It is shown that for inequality constrained hierarchical models, posterior probabilities computed using the method are virtually independent of the specification of the prior distribution. The model with the largest posterior probability is chosen as the one that conforms best to the data. Further, we illustrate how the parameters in inequality constrained hierarchical models can be estimated. An advantage of the Bayesian approach is that estimates of the model parameters can be obtained easily using samples from the posterior distribution and the approach allows several models to be compared. This is in contrast to classical hypothesis testing where one can only have two hypotheses (null and alternative) with a necessity for the null to be nested in the alternative. The last chapter (Chapter 5) deals with posterior predictive model selection in the context of inequality constrained hierarchical models. Model selection is accomplished through choosing a model that minimizes the mean squared distance between the observed data and a future observation vector. Basically this approach to model selection chooses a model that would best predict the observed data. We argue that posterior predictive model selection has several (potential) advantages over classical hypothesis testing'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Next to thromboembolism from the atherosclerotic plaque, impaired cerebral perfusion is the main mechanism of cerebral ischemia in patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis. There is supporting evidence of a synergistic effect of both embolic and hemodynamic factors. An understanding of both mechanisms in the occurrence of cerebral ischemia is important. This thesis explored the role of cerebral perfusion in patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis. Three etiologic questions related to cerebral perfusion were addressed in this thesis. First, is cerebral perfusion related to the presence of a carotid artery stenosis? Second, does cerebral perfusion improve due to the treatment of carotid stenosis by carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or carotid artery stenting (CAS)? Third, is cerebral perfusion related to the occurrence of cerebral ischemia? In chapter 2 describes an inverse relation found between the degree of carotid artery stenosis and the cerebral perfusion in the ipsilateral MCA territory was found. The improvement of cerebral perfusion after CEA and CAS on cerebral perfusion is described in patients with an unilateral carotid artery stenosis in chapter 3. An important new finding in this study is that significantly more improvement in cerebral perfusion was found in the patients treated with CAS than in patients treated with CEA. Pre-operative cerebral perfusion asymmetries were assessed in patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis before CEA in chapter 4. The occurrence of the cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome after CEA is related to higher cerebral perfusion asymmetries before treatment. Cerebral perfusion measurements were related to the occurrence of silent ischemia, as in the presence of ischemic lesions on diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), after CAS in chapter 5. The occurrence of new ipsilateral lesions was related to impaired cerebral perfusion before the procedure. This supports the synergistic effect of both embolic and hemodynamic factors. In chapter 6 the difference in the occurrence of silent cerebral ischemia after CEA or CAS were examined by DWI before and after treatment. Approximately three times more patients in the CAS group than in the CEA group had new ischemic lesions on DWI on post-treatment scans. In chapter 7 we used multidetector-row CT angiography to examine the prevalence of in-stent lesions during follow-up after carotid artery stenting. In-stent lesions are present in 20% of the patients treated with CAS. The presence of in-stent lesions was not related to ischemic complications or in-stent restenosis at one year follow-up. In chapter 8 the findings of this thesis are discussed and the three etiologic question posed in the introduction are answered. First, the presence of a carotid artery stenosis in patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis results in impaired cerebral perfusion. Second, cerebral perfusion improves after CAS and CEA and may explain the decreased risk of recurrent ischemic events in long-term follow-up. Third, impaired cerebral perfusion in patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis is related to the occurrence of their ischemic symptoms. These findings support the presence and role of cerebral perfusion in the occurrence of ischemia in patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis'],\n",

This study was designed as a proof-of-principle that immunoadsorption of substances by VHH is a feasible, effective technique.

The second part of this thesis, ’Removing excess volume’, describes a novel method to measure absolute plasma refill rates during hemodialysis, using a feedback-regulated ultrafiltration system coupled to a dialysis machine. We designed this system because we wanted to be able to non-invasively measure absolute plasma refill rates continuously during dialysis. This system is the first to do so, and, using the method, we investigated the influence of blood-pressure stabilizing interventions on refill.

       "  'Description': ['Current radiotherapy treatment machines use the treatment beam or the integrated cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) functionality for patient positioning based on bony structures or implanted tumour markers. The University Medical Center Utrecht, in cooperation with Elekta and Philips, is developing a radiotherapy accelerator with fully integrated diagnostic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) functionality. MRI provides superior soft-tissue contrast, which will enable patient positioning based on the tumour itself. The clinical rationale for the MRI-accelerator system is considered in this thesis. The rationale is evaluated for various tumour sites on different time scales. The benefit of this unique hybrid design can be divided into two aspects: online image guidance and dose response assessment. This thesis is limited to the aspect of online image guidance. The fact that most soft tissue structures not only change in position but also in shape makes it inevitable to use online volumetric image guidance for improved daily verification of the patient set-up. If the image guidance is fast enough, real-time monitoring or tracking of highly mobile tumours will become feasible, making radiotherapy a treatment option for more tumour sites. Cervical cancer patients will benefit in terms of healthy tissue sparing in the primary tumour region as the target volumes change their position and shape continuously during the course of the treatment. Online MRI images, acquired at the beginning of each treatment fraction, visualise the actual position and shape of the uterus and can be used for a simple rigid correction or a treatment plan adaptation. This approach allows planning target volume (PTV) margin reduction as interfraction motion is corrected directly on the treatment table. Guidelines to limit intrafraction bladder filling may further reduce the needed PTV margins, which results in additional healthy tissue sparing. Our current clinical practice of marker based position verification for prostate cancer patients is fairly accurate. Therefore, the benefit of MRI-guided radiotherapy for prostate cancer patients will be the daily visualisation of the healthy surroundings. This allows a better complication risk assessment and a safer dose escalation to the intraprostatic lesions located close to the rectal wall. Surgery is the only established curative treatment option for renal cell carcinoma. Urological complications as intraoperative hemorrhage and postoperative urine leakage still occur; therefore a non-invasive approach remains the ultimate treatment. The technical feasibility of real-time MRI-guided radiotherapy in terms of breath-holding, treatment planning, and radiation delivery time is presented. The clinical rationale for the MRI-accelerator system is not limited to the tumour sites described in this thesis. The MRI-accelerator has great potential for all tumour sites that exhibit large variation in position, size, or shape during the course of the radiotherapy treatment, for example the bladder, the rectum, the pancreas, and the liver. The clinical introduction of the MRI-accelerator will be facilitated by the construction of a dedicated center for image guided oncological interventions, which will house three MRI-accelerators. Improvement of current radiotherapy treatments as well as the development of radiotherapy strategies for new tumour sites will be investigated.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Post-translational modifications are modifications of peptides or proteins after they have been synthesized in the ribosomes. These post-translational modifications (PTM’s) are intended to augment functional diversity of the 20 natural L-amino acids of which proteins are constructed. PTM’s have important functions and most are crucial for the tasks of the modified proteins. Sulfation was recognized as a post-translational modification of proteins in 1954 and it was slowly realized that tyrosine sulfation is a widespread modification of excreted and membrane bound peptides and proteins. Sulfation is catalyzed by two membrane bound tyrosylprotein sulfotransferases (TPST) located in the trans Golgi, which use PAPS as universal sulfate donor. Although sulfation is believed to be a widespread and biologically very important PTM, it has not been studied in great detail. This is mainly because of the instability of the sulfate group, especially under acidic conditions. In this thesis a new sequence independent synthesis method for the site selective introduction of multiple sulfated tyrosine residues into bioactive peptides is described. This method is applied on the synthesis of sulfated Leu-enkephalin and a collection of site selective sulfated N-terminal fragments of the Complement factor 5b Receptor (C5aR). This N-terminal part of the C5aR forms the binding site of the Chemotaxis Inhibitory Proteins of Staphylococcus aureus (CHIPS), an immunomodulatory protein excreted by S. aureus to prevent the C5aR from being activated by its natural ligand C5a. By preventing the activation of the C5aR, CHIPS can prevent the recruitment of specific white blood cells to the site of infection. The (over)activation of the C5a-receptor has been linked to several serious inflammatory diseases and therefore CHIPS and mimics of CHIPS could form a very interesting new class of anti-inflammatory compounds. The synthesized sulfated fragments of the C5aR are used to study the binding of CHIPS to the C5a-Receptor by ITC and NMR spectroscopy. The structure of CHIPS in complex with the N-terminus of the C5aR is elucidated, which reveals crucial structural elements within CHIPS for tight binding to the C5aR. These structural elements are selected and combined to design and synthesize new classes of C5aR inhibitors. One class based on the versatile TAC-scaffold were successfully synthesized but appeared to show no detectable affinity towards the sulfated C5aR fragments. A promising class of CHIPS mimics, based on a shortened CHIPS fragment including the fragments which interact with the C5aR, showed a low micromolar affinity towards the sulfated N-terminal part of the C5aR. The designed mimic CHOPS is a promising lead structure for development of new anti-inflammatory drug candidates.'],\n",

Respiratory tract infections are the most important cause of mortality in individuals with DS at all ages. In this thesis we have described DS to be a risk factor for severe RSV infections. Subsequently, we have shown that children with DS suffer from a high incidence of recurrent wheeze. The relevance of this study is that RSV prevention might be possible using immunoprophylaxis. In recent decades several studies have been performed to elucidate abnormalities of the immune system in DS. In order to clarify the clinical problems frequently seen in this specific population we studied the innate immune system and T-cell dynamics. We showed that insufficient thymic output causes low number of naïve T-cells in children with DS, while peripheral mechanisms regulating the size of the naïve T-cell pool appear intact. In addition, we have shown distinct abnormalities of cells of the innate immune system in children with DS. We have concluded that these immunologic abnormalities might result in decreased viral clearance and thus in the high incidence of respiratory morbidity seen in this specific population.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Medication is one of the most commonly applied medical interventions in healthcare and has been shown to improve health and quality of life. Unfortunately it can also do harm and can cause severe adverse events like hospitalisations. The focus in this thesis is on medication related hospital admissions: the magnitude of the problem, the associated provoking factors and the prevention of these admissions. The first study we conducted was the multicenter HARM (Hospital Admissions Related to Medication) study in 21 hospitals in the Netherlands. A case-control design was used to determine risk factors for potentially preventable admissions. This study shows that 5.6% of all unplanned admissions were medication related of which almost half (46.5%) were potentially preventable. The main determinants of preventable medication-related hospital admissions were impaired cognition (odds ratio, 11.9; 95% confidence interval (CI), 3.9-36.3), 4 or more comorbidities (8.1; 3.1-21.7), dependent living situation (3.0; 1.4-6.5), impaired renal function (2.6; 1.6-4.2), non-adherence to the medication regimen (2.3; 1.4-3.8) and polypharmacy (2.7; 1.6-4.4). Impaired renal function was not only a risk factor but 70 admissions (10%) were related to renal impairment and a medication error. HARMs are not only a burden to patients and their relatives but also to society, involving high costs. Combining the medical costs and those of production losses resulted in average costs of €6009 for one, potentially preventable, medication-related hospital admission for all ages. The identified risk factors provided a starting point for preventing medication-related hospital admissions in our second study the PHARM (Preventing Hospital Admissions by Reviewing Medication) study. This study was a controlled, multi-centre study in an integrated primary care setting. We included only patients with a high risk of a HARM. The intervention, the pharmaceutical care process, consisted of a pharmaceutical anamnesis, a pharmacotherapy review, a pharmaceutical care plan and the monitoring and follow up evaluation of the care plan. We aimed to include 14200 patients, 7100 in each arm, from at least 142 pharmacies but experienced many difficulties in including patients. Eventually 364 intervention and 310 control patients were included in 42 primary health care settings of at least one pharmacist and at least two GPs. More medication related hospital admissions were found in the control group than in the intervention group; respectively 10 and 6 admissions. The effect was dependent on the number of diseases. The HR (Hazard Ratio) of the intervention for 3 diseases was 0.77 (95% CI: 0.17-2.59); for 4 diseases 0.43 (95%CI: 0.093-1.20); for 5 diseases 0.28 (95% CI: 0.056-0.73); for 6 diseases 0.19 (95% CI: 0.033-0.53); for 7 diseases 0.14 (95% CI: 0.020-0.43) and for 8 diseases 0.11 (95% CI: 0.013-0.34). Between the intervention and control group no statistically significant differences were found in the secondary outcomes survival, adverse drug events and quality of life. With these results we demonstrated that the patient’s own pharmacist together with its own GP and the patient may prevent hospital admissions with a medication related cause but the pharmaceutical care process is difficult to implement in an ordinary primary care setting.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The introduction of highly effective combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) in 1996 resulted in effective, long-term suppression of HIV with consequent recovery of the patient’s immune system. Although the enthusiasm about the effectiveness of current cART remains strong, the ongoing work in the area of HIV disease and treatment complications appears to reflect concerns that these clinical problems will continue to be important and possibly increase over time in the current therapeutic area. There is growing interest in the pathogenesis, treatment and prevention of long-term complications of HIV disease and its therapies. This thesis describes some of the long-term complications of HIV-infection since the introduction of cART. Cardiac and vascular complications are one of the most frequently occurring complications in long-term surviving HIV-infected patients in different ethnical populations. In the first part markers of coagulation, anticoagulation and fibrinolysis are studied to define a possible pathogenic mechanism for the increased risk of cardiovascular disease as a long-term complication in HIV-infected patients. An improvement in markers of inflammation and coagulation after initiation of cART was found. Nevertheless, markers of inflammation and coagulation did not normalize even with undetectable HIV viral load. In the second part of this dissertation the prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in the anogenital area and HPV-associated precursor lesions of anogenital malignancies in HIV-infected men and women in the cART era are studied. Non-AIDS defining malignancies have an increasing incidence in the HIV-infected population and are responsible for considerable mortality. These malignancies could be related to co-infection with viruses like the human papillomavirus (HPV) or Epstein-Barr virus. In the second part we observed a generally high HPV prevalence and a high prevalence of cervical and anal dysplasia in both HIV-infected men and women. Screening HIV-infected sexually active women for cervical dysplasia is recommended while screening for anal dysplasia is no common practice. Screening of the HIV-infected population or of certain risk groups, like HIV-infected MSM, for anal dysplasia should become a routine preventive measure. In the third part HIV-related fatigue is studied as another highly prevalent long-term complication of HIV-infection resulting in significant morbidity. In the third part predictors of HIV-related fatigue are studied to guide future treatment strategies for one of the most common debilitating symptoms in chronic HIV-infected patients. In this dissertation, we investigated several aspects of pathophysiology and screening of some of the long-term complications of HIV-infection. It will become more and more important to define which host, viral and environmental risk factors for developing long-term complications are present and relevant in this specific patient population. Risk factors should be integrated into up-to-date guidelines for screening and treatment strategies. Dealing with the reverse side of the medal of prolonged survival due to effective antiretroviral therapy constitutes a present and future challenge for all HIV caregivers.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Pharmacometrics, the science of quantitative clinical pharmacology, has been recognized as one of the main research fields able to improve efficiency in drug development, and to reduce attrition rates on the route from drug discovery to approval. This field of drug research, which builds heavily on the sciences of mathematics, statistics, pharmacology and biology, provides a tool for studying relationships between drug exposure and drug effects. This thesis concerns the application of pharmacometrics in the early clinical development of drugs, and has a strong focus on oncology. The thesis shows that the use of population modelling & simulation greatly facilitates the appropriate handling of all available data, including data which may be difficult to handle using standard approaches (e.g. missing, censored or baseline data). It is shown here that, especially when faced with such limitations or challenges, the use of modeling techniques instead of reliance on the more conventional statistical techniques, allows the most appropriate and data-efficient analysis of data. Of course, this is especially relevant when data is sparse or associated with high variability, which is often the case in (early) clinical studies. The thesis shows that the use of pharmacodynamic biomarkers in a PK-PD analysis can greatly support the early clinical development of new drugs. Several pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) analyses in early drug development are presented in the thesis, incorporating a PD biomarker for efficacy or toxicity. One of the chapters presents the construction of a model for the occurrence of hypertension and proteinuria toxicity during treatment with a novel anticancer drug, based on early clinical data. Subsequent simulations using this model provided support for the hypertension intervention scheme proposed for Phase II clinical development, and showed that intra-patient dose escalations using hypertension as a biomarker may be feasible without inducing considerable toxicity. In another analysis, preclinical and early clinical biomarker and tumour growth data were combined to allow an early assessment of anticancer activity of another novel drug. In two other chapters, investigations into the predictive ability and schedule-dependency of a PK-PD model for haematological toxicity during treatment with anticancer drugs are described. When modelling early clinical or preclinical data, the modeller is often confronted with technical difficulties concerning incomplete data. In the final section of the thesis, investigations are presented into two such problems: data below the limit of quantification (BLOQ) and incomplete covariate datasets. For the former problem, it was shown that the use of extrapolated BLOQ concentration data provides superior performance over established methods. For the latter problem, an approach in which an extra parameter for covariate effect was estimated for the group in which data on the covariate was missing, provided the easiest and most robust performance to analyses such datasets. The thesis also describes the construction of a graphical user interface, Piraña, which facilitates the use of the modelling software NONMEM and improves workflow for pharmacometric scientists.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is one of the most important causes of hospital admissions and together with influenza the third leading cause of death worldwide. Moreover, treatment of CAP largely contributes to the global burden of antibiotic resistance. In present thesis, we explored options for individualized treatment of CAP, in a spectrum from initial inflammatory response to long-term prognosis. In the past years, the genetic risk for infection has been regarded as an increasingly important determinant of CAP. We provide an overview of the enormous amount of genetics variations (polymorphisms) in diverse inflammatory genes, leaving no doubt that there is a genetic basis for susceptibility to or outcome from CAP. Unfortunately, none of them has lead to any clinical applications yet. As a first step in translation of statistical association into clinical practice, we report a functional polymorphism in the TFPI gene associated with a benificial response to adjuvant treatment with rTFPI for severe (pneumo)sepsis. Theoretically this polymorphism can be used to select individuals for adjuvant treatment. Procalcitonin (PCT) testing is also mentioned as a promising strategy to better select individuals necessitating antibiotics and hereby reduce antibiotic prescriptions, especially in primary care setting. For another biomarker, C-reactive protein (CRP), we show that normalization patterns may help to determine appropriateness of antibiotic treatment. Therefore, consecutive CRP measurements seem useful in the first week of follow-up to select patients unresponsive to initiated therapy. Concering antibiotic treatment, equality of the advised empiric antibiotic strategies for in-hospital treatment of CAP in terms of selection for Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is unclear. The data suggest that not a particular group of antibiotics but more individual determined risk factors, such as duration of antibiotic treatment or previous hospitalizations, are associated with nosocomial C. difficile acquisition. Another important topic in antibiotic treatment for CAP is the time to first antibiotic dose (TFAD), which has been implemented as performance indicator for all CAP patients. Our data show that for individuals admitted to general wards -in contrast to those necessitating treatment in the ICU directly- one can take time to establish a reliable diagnosis before administration of antibiotics. We also studied the resolution of radiographic abnormalities in patients with mild to severe CAP. Radiological clearance rates were 56-70% after one month and lag behind resolution of symptoms. Therefore, monitoring a favorable disease process by routine follow-up chest radiographs leads has no additional value above following a patient’s clinical course. Finally, we show that long-term mortality rates after an episode of CAP are high; up to 53% after 7 years and considerably higher than in a matched population cohort. In the long-term, ex-pneumonia patients seem more likely to die because of co-morbidities than recurrent pneumonia. These insights in causes of death on the long-term may offer new targets for individual risk profiling and prevention.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Osteoarthritis is a slowly degenerating joint disease with a high and still increasing incidence. The disease is characterized by pain, stiffness, and functional disabilities. Cartilage damage and subchondral bone changes, accompanied by synovial inflammation are causative. Current treatment aims at controlling pain and improving function, and will inevitably lead to surgical interventions, with finally replacement of the joint by an endoprosthesis. There are many factors involved in development and progression of OA,(over)loading playing a mayor role. Overloading can be caused e.g. by obesity, malalignment with a shift of the loading axis, joint instability in case of ligament and/or muscle dysfunction, and focal overloading due to impaired mechanical properties of surrounding cartilage or bone tissue. The first part of this thesis studies the role of loading in the development of OA with a focus on bone and cartilage interaction. Studying development and treatment of OA requires the use of animal models. The recently developed canine Groove model was compared to human OA. Despite species-specific differences, OA induced changes were similar, making the model suitable for evaluation of the disease. Using this and several other canine models of OA to study early changes in OA, in collaboration with the dept. of orthopedics Erasmus MC, revealed that early in the process of OA thinning of the subchondral plate coincides with cartilage degeneration whereas impairment of subchondral trabecular bone structure is related to unloading of the joint. Thinning of the subchondral plate is suggested to be dependent on soluble mediators originating from the cartilage which is damaged due to overloading. The second part of this thesis studies unloading as a treatment of OA. After an overview of possibilities to unload a joint, there is a focus on unloading joint in end stage OA by use of joint distraction. By placement of a external fixator bridging the joint, the joint is distracted for a few millimeters, avoiding the cartilage surfaces to contact. Biomechanical conditions were created that allow cartilage and bone to repair. By use of the aforementioned canine Groove model a beneficial effect on cartilage quality could be demonstrated. In collaboration with the veterinary department of the UU these structural changes appeared to be accompanied by improved loading (less pain) of the affect joint. A study in patients with severe ankle OA in collaboration with the University of Iowa showed clinical benefits which might be explained by bone repair activity. A final study in patients with severe knee OA in collaboration with the department of orthopedics showed clinical improvement but also cartilage repair, even in severely damaged areas, by use of X-ray, MRI and biomarker analyses. Joint distraction is the first treatment of OA that is able to induce cartilage and bone regeneration in severe end stage OA, accompanied by clear prolonged clinical benefit.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The use of animal models has been crucial for studying the function of genetic elements in the human genome. Embryonic stem (ES) cell-based homologous recombination (HR) has proven a very efficient technique for gene manipulation. However, this technique is not (yet) available for all model organisms due to the inability of maintaining a pluripotent state of ES cells in culture. The laboratory rat Rattus norvegicus is one of the most used model organisms in biomedical research, especially for studying physiology, pharmacology, toxicology and neurobiology. Due to the long lack of pluripotent rat ES cells, alternative methods to manipulate its genome have been developed. The first genetic rat knockout models were developed using chemically-induced mutagenesis, which is based on treating male rats with the mutagen N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) that very efficiently introduces point mutations in the spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs). Subsequently, the ENU-treated rats are crossed with untreated rats to generate an F1 population in which each animal contains unique heterozygous mutation throughout its genome. Finally, mutations that affect gene function are identified and crossed to homozygocity in order to study its effect. The technique can be used for both forward (phenotype-driven) and reverse (gene-driven) genetics approaches. In this thesis the optimization and application of the reverse genetics procedure, termed target-selected mutagenesis, in the rat has been described. In this approach the DNA of F1 animals is screened for mutations in pre-selected genes using molecular biological techniques. The efficiency of the approach depends on 1) the mutation frequency and 2) mutation discovery. By taking advantage of DNA mismatch repair (MMR)-deficiency, a system involved in repairing ENU-induced DNA damage, in the MSH6 knockout rat, we demonstrate that the mutation frequency can be significantly increased. After obtaining a F1 library, different techniques have been applied to identify interesting mutations. Here, we combine massive parallel sequence technology with microarray-based enrichment of genomic regions of interest to further improve the mutation discovery efficiency. The increased efficiency of the approach was demonstrated by screening a large set of genes in the rat encoding one-to-one orthologs of human G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This large family of seven transmembrane receptors play essential roles in physiology and disease; however, genetically altered GPCR animal models are scarce, especially in non-murine species. Using this approach multiple mutant rat lines were isolated, including knockout as well as missense animals. Extensive bioinformatic analyses were applied in order to prioritize the missense mutants. We show loss of function for a knockout allele of the melanocortin 4 receptor (Mc4r) and a missense allele of the lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1 (Lpar1) confirming our analyses. ENU mutagenesis is a non-redundant gene manipulation technique with several unique advantages. It is highly efficient and random in introducing germ line point mutations, which resemble the most common form of human genetic variation. Furthermore, it allows for allelic series production, which can be important for studying specific gene function. In conclusion, using chemically-induced mutagenesis we have significantly contributed to the generation and characterization of genetically manipulated rats that model human disease.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['This thesis aimed to quantify the impact of subclinical mastitis in dairy cattle in the Netherlands and to explore the epidemiologic and economic effects of antimicrobial treatment of recently acquired subclinical mastitis during lactation. First, the occurrence of (sub)clinical mastitis was estimated in a one-year observational study. It was concluded that herds in the Netherlands varied substantially in their mastitis occurrence, indicating room for improvement of udder health. The relation between subclinical mastitis (indicated by a somatic cell count (SCC) ?200,000 cells/ml) and clinical mastitis was investigated next. Primiparae with a high composite SCC had a fourfold higher risk to develop clinical mastitis than primiparae with a low SCC. This was twofold higher for multiparae. Approximately 25% of clinical mastitis cases can be prevented when high SCC cows are prevented or removed from the dairy population. The therapeutic effects of antimicrobial treatment of recently acquired subclinical mastitis during lactation were studied in a randomized field trial in 40 Dutch dairy herds. Cows with recently acquired streptococci or staphylococci subclinical mastitis were randomly assigned antimicrobial treatment. Treated quarters had a higher bacteriological cure and decrease in SCC than control quarters. Evaluating the effect of duration of infection revealed that early treatment of Staph. aureus subclinical mastitis tended to be more effective than later treatment. Staph. aureus isolates obtained from the field trial were genotyped to determine whether strains that are commonly found in multiple host species differed in bacteriological cure from strains primarily associated with bovine mastitis. Bacteriological cure of strains associated with multiple host species was around 2.5 times higher compared with strains primarily associated with bovine mastitis. Host adaptation of Staph. aureus was found to be associated with known predictors of cure. Staph. aureus strains associated with multiple host species were more often penicillin-resistant. Additionally, penicillin-resistant, mastitis associated Staph. aureus strains had a higher SCC than other strains. The direct and indirect epidemiologic and economic effects of lactational treatment of recently acquired subclinical mastitis caused by contagious pathogens were studied using a dynamic and stochastic bio-economic model. Lactational treatment of contagious pathogens resulted in less clinical flare-ups, less transmission within the herd and lower annual costs of intramammary infections. Lactational treatment of subclinical mastitis must be accompanied by other management measures to decrease transmission of contagious pathogens within the dairy herd to be economically beneficial. Antimicrobial treatment of subclinical mastitis caused by environmental pathogens did not seem to be economically beneficial. A decision tree was developed to select herds and cows to most likely benefit from lactational treatment of recently acquired subclinical mastitis with antimicrobials.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The aim of gene therapy is to treat, cure or prevent a disease by replacing defective genes, introducing new genes or changing the expression of a person’s genes. Success of gene therapy is dependent on successful delivery of DNA from the site of administration into cell nuclei. Naturally occurring and highly efficient gene delivery systems are viruses. However, issues of safety, limited targeting possibilities and limited loading capacity justify the search for safe and flexible synthetic (non-viral) alternatives. Despite numerous efforts, success of non-viral gene delivery is hampered due to four major problems: toxicity, short-lived expression, heterogeneity of expression and low efficiency. The aim of this thesis is to rationally design DNA-Transporting Nanoparticles (DTN), focusing on three levels: (1) design of DNA to increase safety, efficiency and duration of transgene expression, (2) design of formulations to increase efficiency of transfection and (3) development of methods to allow better analysis of DTN. First it is shown how rational design of plasmid DNA can increase safety, efficiency and duration of transgene expression. Next, two strategies to improve nuclear uptake of DTN are examined. The first strategy involves modification of plasmid with DNA nuclear Targeting Sequences (DTS) which would facilitate nuclear localization by inducing coating of plasmid DNA with nuclear localization signals (NLS)-containing proteins and subsequent binding to importins. Modification of plasmids with DTS was not shown to increase gene expression, regardless of the cell line, dose and carrier system chosen, indicating that a bottleneck exists downstream of nuclear delivery. The second strategy was based on the non-covalent coupling of NLS-peptides to DNA. Peptides were shown to enhance transfection efficiency, but in an NLS-independent way. Next, the number of plasmids per DTN is addressed. The amount of active DNA could be reduced substantially while maintaining transfection activity by replacing active DNA with non-coding junk DNA. The results indicate that not the total amount of DNA, but the number of active DNA-containing particles is the critical factor in determining transfection efficiency. Size of DTN is a critical parameter, but preparation of DTN generally yields heterogeneously sized populations. Additionally, the size of DTN is affected by exposure to salts and proteins. A new method based on flow cytometry was developed to measure particle size distributions directly in biological fluids. Simultaneous detection of fluorescence and side scattering intensity (SSC ; indicative of size) provided the possibility to distinguish fluorescently labeled nanoparticles of interest from other particulate matter frequently present in biological fluid. Additionally, a proof of principle to sort heterogeneous populations into different size fractions was obtained. Testing of new gene delivery reagents is usually performed by reading out transgene expression levels relative to a reference formulation after in vitro transfection. A large number of variables that affect transfection efficiency was investigated. Based on this dataset, a screening protocol is suggested with the aim of standardization within the field. The research described in this thesis contributes to the understanding of the possibilities and limitations for design and testing of DNA-Transporting Nanoparticles for non-viral gene delivery.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The Canonical Wnt signaling pathway (Wnt/beta-catenin pathway) is required during embryonic development and maintenance of adult-renewing tissue homeostasis. Deregulation of this pathway is found associated with cancer and other diseases. The main goal of this thesis is to discern the regulation mechanisms of canonical Wnt signaling and thereby identify potential drug targets. We found that, neither the dissembled of Axin1, APC or GSK3 from the destruction complex nor inactivation of GSK3 and CKI alpha leads to inactivation of dedicated complex. But dissociation of beta-catenin E3-ubiquitin ligase, beta-Trcp from the complex leads to the saturation of limited Axin1-scaffolded destruction complex by phophorylated beta-catenin. We had also identified several potential Axin binding partners and phosphorylation sites of Axin, APC and WTX, which will guide us to further understanding of the dissociation mechanisms. In additionally, we also found Axin1 bound GSK3 is protected from PKB phosphorylation thereby PI3K/PKB signaling is not able to modulate canonical Wnt signaling through GSK3 inactivation. We also identified MAP3K1 as a positive regulator on canonical Wnt signaling through its E3 ubiquitin ligase function. Lastly, we found a novel potential drug target, Tnik which specifically phosphorylates Tcf4 through recruitment of beta-catenin.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['This thesis is primarily focused on (i.) exploring chemical probes to increase sensitivity and specificity for the investigation of low abundant cardiac proteins applicable to both biology and biomarker discovery, and (ii.) exploiting different aspects of mass spectrometry-based proteomics for building a concentration-based cardiac proteome inventory. Chapter 1 is an overview of the applications of proteomics in cardiac diseases, including detailed descriptions of proteomics platforms used to analyze protein expression, function and quantity. It is also illustrated label-based and label-free mass-spectrometry quantitation methods to monitor changes in the proteome. The traditional biomarker discovery approach is described, including animal models and clinical studies. Chapter 2 reviews the specific contribution of mass spectrometry to the understanding of two particular cardiac signaling pathways that evolve around the second messenger cyclic nucleotides cAMP and cGMP. Two major downstream effectors of these cyclic nucleotides are Protein Kinase A and Protein Kinase G. Their relations to scaffold proteins that compartmentalize these kinases are discussed. An overview of mass spectrometry-based studies such as native mass spectrometry, H/D exchange and ion mobility mass spectrometry were described. In chapter 3, a chemical proteomics approach is combined with stable isotope labeling and mass spectrometry to study the specificity of different PKA isoforms for different AKAPs. Three different immobilized cAMP-analogues were used to enrich for PKA from several cell types and rat tissues. Stable isotope labeling was used to quantify the differential enrichment of the PKA-isoforms and thus their interacting AKAPs. Of the twelve AKAPs detected, seven preferentially bound to RII, whereas the remaining five displayed at least dual-specificity with a potential preference for RI. For the first time, the specificity of AKAP14, AKAP2 and AKAP12 could be established. In Chapter 4, cAMP-based chemical proteomics is employed to identify potential changes in concentration and association of PKA in the dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) affected human heart. Specific enrichment of PKA, PKG, several phosphodiesterases and many AKAPs from both healthy and DCM hearts were quantified in a label-free manner. We confirmed that PKA-R concentrations were lower in DCM affected tissue. Interestingly, the specific interactions of PKA with AKAPs were altered in the diseased heart under DCM conditions. These experiments, demonstrated the powerful combination of chemical proteomics with isotopic labeling as a potential application for cardiac biomarker discovery. Chapter 5 continues with the application of a multiplexed proteomics approach to generate a concentration-based human left ventricle proteome library. By using different separation methods/ proteases/ gas phase fragmentation methods, we identified 3,584 distinct proteins with high confidence which were quantitated using a sophisticated label-free spectral counting method to yield a comprehensive abundance level of human left ventricular proteins. Most currently used CVD-biomarkers, as well as many muscle machinery proteins are present as high abundant proteins in LV. The signaling proteins, protein kinases, phosphatases and small GTPase were studied in the context of their concentrations and the endogenous phosphorylation sites observed in heart. These data form an interesting starting point to prioritize future targets for drug and biomarker discovery efforts in the cardiac context. Finally, all results are placed into perspective in a concluding summary and outlook.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Towards improved bladder cancer diagnosis using fluorescence imaging and Raman spectroscopy'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Bladder cancer is the fourth most common type of cancer worldwide. Its high recurrence rate makes bladder cancer one of the most prevalent types of cancer in the western world and the most costly type of cancer over the patient’s lifetime. In the Netherlands, each year 5,400 new patients with bladder cancer are diagnosed. Approximately 75% of these suffer from non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. These patients have a good prognosis regarding life expectancy. However, 40-80% will develop at least one tumor recurrence within 12 months after primary treatment. Disease progression, though relatively rare (10-15%), to muscle invasive or disseminated disease will severely affect their prognosis. Evaluation of the bladder wall and biopsy of suspect lesions of the bladder are performed during transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT). Histopathology of the acquired biopsy samples is used to establish the final diagnosis of bladder cancer. Frequent reexamination of the bladder and repeated TURBT of suspicious lesions place a significant burden on the public healthcare system. Optimization of this procedure by enhancing early detection will directly affect patient outcome as well as the costs associated with bladder cancer. Fluorescence cystoscopy, as an extension to ordinary visual bladder inspection to improve the detection, has slowly been introduced in urology. It considerably enhances the sensitivity of bladder cancer detection, but suffers from a mediocre specificity. Raman spectroscopy is an optical technique that examines the interaction of light with molecular bonds, which has many applications in the identification of substances and processes because of its inherent specificity. The aim of this thesis is to optimize the clinical application of fluorescence imaging and to assess the place for optical diagnosis by means of Raman spectroscopy. The ultimate goal is to enhance bladder cancer diagnosis, which in the long run should result in the possibility to perform an optical biopsy without the need for confirmation by histopathology. Clinical observations in fluorescence imaging led to an evaluation of the differences between the initial and subsequent fluorescence cystoscopy procedures particularly with respect to its specificity. Raman spectroscopy proved not only able to distinguish between benign and malignant tissues of the bladder, but also allowed prediction of the grade and stage of the lesion in vitro. An evaluation of prerequisites for in vivo fluorescence guided Raman spectroscopy showed this a promising tool to enhance the specificity of bladder cancer detection.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Since 2003, highly pathogenic avian influenza virus subtype H5N1 outbreaks have been reported in Southeast Asia causing high mortality in poultry and have also been found to cross the species barrier infecting human and other mammalian species. Thailand is one of the countries severely affected by the HPAI H5N1 outbreaks. After the first fatal HPAI H5N1 infections were reported in tigers and leopards that had been fed carcasses of infected chickens in a zoo in Thailand, the viruses involved were characterized and studies about the pathogenesis of the disease in these large felids were performed. Since July 2005, HPAI H5N1 viruses have also been detected in Europe and Africa. Migratory birds were suspected to have carried and spread these viruses from Asia. By experimentally infecting wild ducks, tufted ducks, Eurasian pochards, and mallards excreted significantly more virus than common teals, Eurasian wigeons, and gadwalls; yet only tufted ducks and, to a lesser degree, pochards became ill or died. These findings suggest that some wild duck species, particularly mallards, can potentially be long-distance vectors of HPAI H5N1 and that others, particularly tufted ducks, are more likely to act as sentinels. Surveillance studies performed during HPAI H5N1 epidemics in Thailand from 2004 to 2007 provided important epidemiological data. A retrospective analysis was performed to study spatial distribution, temporal analysis and the relationship associated between H5N1 virus outbreaks in poultry flocks and wild birds using a non-homogeneous birth and death statistical model. Transmission efficiency among poultry flocks was 1.7 times higher, in regions with infected wild birds in the given or preceding month. Presence of wild birds may contribute consistently to the spread of HPAI H5N1 virus among poultry flocks. During the widespread outbreaks in Thailand, H5N1 viruses also caused clinical signs and mortality in many of wild birds species. To study the phylogenetic relationship between the HPAI H5N1 virus isolates from poultry and wild birds, a molecular characterization study of the HA and NA genes was carried out to reveal any differences between strains found in different host species. To control pandemic influenza A virus outbreaks, vaccination is a recommended and often effective strategy. A database and repository of the recombinant viruses that can be used for vaccine production, diagnostic and research purposes would be extremely valuable for this purpose. To this end, recombinant influenza A viruses, containing one of the 16 HA subtypes and one of the nine NA subtypes of the Eurasian lineages were produced in a A/PR/8/34 backbone using reverse genetic techniques. The outbreak of HPAI H5N1 causes disease and fatality among avian and mammalian species. As the establishing the diagnosis still constitutes a major challenge, there is a need for adequate information on the possibilities to diagnose the disease in diseased and dead animals. A comprehensive overview was made of HPAI H5N1 virus induced clinical signs and pathology from both natural and experimental studies in different animals and was to provide a practical guide for collecting the appropriate samples to establish the diagnosis HPAI H5N1 in these animals.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['This thesis describes the development and application of methods and models to support decision making on safety measures aimed at preventing the transmission of infections by blood donors. Safety measures refer to screening tests for blood donors, quarantine periods for blood plasma, or methods for detecting or eliminating contaminations during processing. Chapter 1 describes the outline of the PROTON study. In this study a random sample of 20 Dutch hospitals was taken, covering 28% of all blood transfused in the Netherlands between 1996 and 2006. This data allows the construction of descriptive statistics of the Dutch blood transfusion recipient in terms of gender, disease and survival per type of blood component. In Chapter 2 a detailed study is performed on the estimation of recipient survival after transfusion. It is shown that the standard Kaplan-Meier method can be applied to calculate survival after transfusion despite the fact that patients can receive multiple transfusions. Variance estimates, however, will generally be biased downward and have to be determined by bootstrapping transfusion recipients. In Chapter 3 the cost-effectiveness of bacterial culturing (BCU) is compared to that of pathogen inactivation (PRT) for detecting bacterial contamination in platelets. Despite the fact that the individual cost-effectiveness ratio estimates are highly uncertain, it can be concluded that BCU is without doubt more cost-effective than PRT. In chapter 4 the cost-effectiveness of additional hepatitis B screening is determined. Despite a higher effectiveness, testing individual donations is less cost-effective than testing pooled donations. Chapter 5 describes an enhancement of the value of information (VOI) concept. This provides a decision maker with information on clinical outcomes as well as a value in monetary terms. As this attributable VOI can be obtained by merely reorganizing data already available, its calculation is recommended for all VOI analyses. Chapter 6 delineates a generic probabilistic model for assessing risks of plasma derived medicinal products. This model renders improved estimates as well as new opportunities for analysis as compared to models used in the past. Chapter 7 describes the development and application of a regression model dedicated to virus validation robustness studies. The new model provides stronger p-values to the relevant covariates and its use is recommended for future studies. Chapter 8 describes statistical tools and methods for signalling changes or outliership of incidence rates in specific blood collection centres. The tools can be applied by any blood establishment or plasma fractionation institute. All of the models described in this thesis aim to enhance insights and are able to deliver, be it at a price: they force reality into a rigid mathematical structure. However, when forcing focus on the essential aspects of a system they still allow deriving valid conclusions. They offer the opportunity to develop novel insights, explore alternatives and view outcomes from new perspectives. Models therefore deliver an irreplaceable and unequivocal contribution to the quality of decision making within blood safety.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Amino acids are among the most important molecules for living beings, since they are used to build peptides and proteins. Depending on their spatial positioning, amino acids can occur as D- or L-amino acids. This determines the function of peptides and proteins in the human body. It was long thought that only L-amino acids occurred in nature. In this respect, identification of the D-amino acid D-serine in the human brain was revolutionary. Moreover, D-serine appeared to function as a neurotransmitter by binding to the NMDA-receptor, similar to glycine. We developed two different analysis techniques to determine concentrations of D-serine (and glycine and other D- and L-amino acids) in biological fluids and determined reference ranges in cerebrospinal fluid from apparently healthy subjects. We observed very high D-serine concentrations directly after birth, both absolutely and relative to glycine and L-serine, followed by a rapid decline over the first 3 years to low adult values. Patients with the rare metabolic disorder 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase deficiency fail to reach these high D-serine concentrations after birth and display severe neurological symptoms, including microcephaly, seizures and mental retardation. The one patient identified and treated pre- and postnatally did achieve high D-serine concentrations after birth and was born with a normal head circumference, no epilepsy and she develops well. The NMDA-receptor plays an important role in central nervous system development and we hypothesized that D-serine, as an NMDA-receptor agonist, might be essential in this respect. In fact, we demonstrate preliminary evidence for a role for D-serine in synaptogenesis in a P19 cell model for neuronal differentiation. The NMDA-receptor has also been implicated in numerous pathological conditions and we hypothesized that D-serine might play a role in these disorders, including perinatal asphyxia, one of the greatest causes of neonatal mortality and morbidity worldwide. We therefore investigated D-serine concentrations in rat glioma cells and in cerebrospinal fluid from piglets and human newborns after (simulated) hypoxia-ischemia. We observed significant increases in concentrations of both endogenous NMDAr co-agonists D-serine and glycine after hypoxia-ischemia, which in combination with the known elevated glutamate concentrations upon global ischemia are bound to lead to massive NMDAr activation, excitotoxicity and neuronal damage. Influencing these NMDAr co-agonist concentrations provides an interesting treatment target for this common, devastating and currently untreatable condition. Schizophrenia is another disease strongly associated with NMDAr dysfunction and potentially with altered D-serine concentrations. However, we found no differences in D-serine or glycine concentrations between cerebrospinal fluid from male patients with schizophrenia and controls before and after treatment with the antipsychotic drug olanzapine. This implies that cerebrospinal fluid D-serine and glycine concentrations do not represent an easy diagnostic or therapeutic marker for schizophrenia. Potentially, cerebrospinal fluid does not reflect subtle concentration differences in specific brain regions, which might be present in schizophrenia. In conclusion, the unexpected finding of D-serine in the human brain does not only challenge our conventional ideas on human physiology and pathology, but might also contribute to the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Cell division has long been used as a therapeutic target for cancer treatment. Many agents that are clinically beneficial in the treatment of cancer block chromosome segregation during cell division and thereby inhibit the ability of cancer cells to divide. Thus, a better understanding of cell division and knowledge of all the proteins involved in cell division will hopefully allow the identification of novel therapeutic targets in the treatment of cancer. During cell division, duplicated sister chromatids must attach to microtubules coming from opposite spindle poles in order to be segregated equally over the two daughter cells during anaphase. For successful biorientation of kinetochores to occur, the mitotic spindle must form a bipolar structure. In addition, individual kinetochores must attach to microtubules very tightly to maintain attached for many minutes under continuous movement of microtubules and chromosomes, but at the same time these attachments must be very dynamic to allow for correction of erroneous attachments and turnover of individual microtubules in a kinetochore-microtubule bundle. In this thesis, the molecular mechanisms underlying kinetochore-microtubule attachment and bipolar spindle assembly are addressed. Using a combination of candidate and unbiased RNAi screens, several novel proteins are identified that are involved in the formation of kinetochore-microtubule attachments. Mechanistically, these proteins appear to have distinct functions in the process of kinetochore-microtubule attachment. While CLIP-170 is likely involved in the initial capture of microtubules at kinetochores, RAMA1 (also known as Ska3) is likely involved in the stable interaction between microtubules and kinetochores. Finally, GAK promotes the formation of new microtubules in the vicinity of kinetochores, which facilitates the process of kinetochore-microtubule attachment. The kinesin-5 motor Eg5 has been viewed as the major motor that drives bipolar spindle assembly in many different experimental systems by sliding microtubules apart. However, it is possible that additional motors are involved in spindle bipolarity that cooperate with or antagonize Eg5. Here, this possibility is tested using a systematic assay in which the role of all kinesins and dynein in bipolar spindle assembly is analyzed. This analysis revealed that indeed multiple additional microtubule motors cooperate with Eg5 to promote bipolar spindle assembly and that one motor, dynein, antagonizes Eg5’s function. These results not only yield novel insights into the mechanism of bipolar spindle assembly, but also have clinical relevance. Currently, inhibitors of Eg5 are tested in clinical trials as novel anti-cancer agents, as Eg5 was generally thought to be indispensable for bipolar spindle formation and thus for cell division. Results described in this thesis show that other motors are involved as well, and that at least one of these motors, Kif15, can take over all the essential functions of Eg5. These results suggest that the effectiveness of Eg5-inhibitors in cancer therapy may depend on the functionality of additional motors.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Many orthopaedic procedures require fusion of a bony defect. Sometimes a bone graft is needed for this fusion. Autograft bone is considered the golden standard. The harvesting of this bone is time consuming and may have serious side effects, such as chronic donor site pain. Available alternatives are reviewed and discussed based on their benefits and drawbacks. As an alternative, bone Tissue Engineering (TE), i.e. osteoprogenitor cells seeded on porous ceramic scaffolds, for spinal fusion was the main focus of this thesis. The discovery of Bone Marrow Stromal Cells (BMSCs), present in low concentrations in fresh bone marrow, offered a chance to select and proliferate the cells that have the potential to form bone. Methods to study the technique of bone TE should follow an established route of increasing clinical relevance: first proof of the concept studies in small animal models, then feasibility studies in large animal models and finally pre-clinical testing in clinically relevant efficacy models are to be performed. Several animal models for both proof of the concept studies (e.g. ectopic nude mice implantations) and feasibility studies (e.g. posterolateral spine fusions in rabbits and goats) were discussed. Furthermore, a method to study the progression of bone formation in vivo with fluorochromes has regained attention with the introduction of bone TE research after its introduction in the 1950s, when it was used in e.g. osteoporosis studies in humans. A protocol for three of the most frequently used fluorochromes (based on the literature and personal experience) for both small and large animal studies was given in this thesis in an attempt to standardize its use in bone TE studies. Additionally, a new method to study cell proliferation on 3D porous ceramic scaffolds was studied in nude mice. Is was found that seeding more cells does not necessarily lead to more bone formation in vivo on two different porous ceramic scaffolds. A first proof of the concept study was performed in a posterior spine fusion model in rats. Cell seeded and control scaffolds were placed in an ectopic location and compared to a more orthotopic paraspinal implant location. Ectopic bone formation was seen in all the cell seeded implants and none in the controls. Paraspinal bone formation was seen within the implants and in contact with the spinous processes of some of the rats in a first step towards spinal fusion. However, no solid fusions were found. In a subsequent study, paraspinal bone formation in a posterolateral fusion model in goats was compared to an ectopic location intramuscularly. Ectopically, abundant bone formation was found in the TE group whereas hardly any bone was found in the paraspinal location. Several factors were discussed to play a crucial role, such as the poor packing density of the scaffolds and the mechanical instability in the spine location without instrumentation. Upscaling the use of bone TE to clinically relevant models introduces many hurdles that may all be related to delayed or poor vascularisation. Several potential ways to circumvent this issue were discussed'],\n",

Dietary feed additives based on essential oil components are marketed to enhance growth performance and health. It is claimed that under practical conditions dietary essential oil components improve digestion and stimulate feed intake, and consequently raise growth performance. However, the effect of essential oils on animal performance has not been proved in a controlled study. \\r\\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the role of essential oils as the possible alternatives to antibiotics in poultry nutrition. Female broiler chickens were used as an animal model to study the effect of essential oils on growth performance, activities of digestive enzymes, macronutrient digestion and lipid metabolism. Furthermore, experiments were carried out to test whether dietary essential oil components could either counteract anti-nutrient effect of carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) or rye. Finally, the possible synergistic effects of individual essential oil components were tested in relation to growth performance when chickens were fed on a diet containing CMC. \\r\\nThe literature review describes the general biological activities of essential oils. Dietary essential oils can have several useful biological properties, e.g., acting as antimicrobial substance and antioxidants, and being hypocholesterolemic, affecting flavor, and stimulating the digestion process. Their metabolic pathways have been well elucidated, and based on that observation, it was suggested that their side effects are unlikely. Due to a limited number of controlled studies on the effect of essential oil components on growth performance in broiler chickens, an experiment was conducted to describe the effect of thymol, cinnamaldehyde and a commercial preparation of essential oil components (CRINA\\uf0d2 Poultry) on growth performance, digestive enzyme activities and macronutrient digestibilities. Corn-soybean meal based diet was used to prepare the experimental diets and chicks were housed in wire-bottomed cages. It was shown that no effect of essential oil components on any of parameters monitored in female broiler chickens was observed, but it can not be excluded that positive effects would have been observed under less hygienic environmental conditions or when using a less digestible diet. However, in this study dietary cinnamaldehyde significantly lowered water intake without affecting growth performance. Consequently, dry matter contents of excreta were higher in birds fed diet containing cinnamaldehyde. The observed cinnamaldehyde-induced reduction of spontaneous water intake could be commercially interesting. \\r\\nIn subsequent studies, we further screened dietary carvacrol, and \\uf062-ionone as potential feed additives in female broiler chickens. Furthermore, we tested the alleged hypocholesterolemic effect of dietary essential oil components when the chickens were fed either cholesterol-free or cholesterol-rich diets. It was found that dietary carvacrol lowered feed intake and weight gain, but also lowered the feed:gain ratio. The carvacrol effect on feed:gain ratio could relate to increased efficiency of feed utilization and/or altered carcass composition. Unfortunately, carcass composition of the chickens was not analyzed. Carvacrol lowered plasma triglyceride concentrations, but did not affect plasma cholesterol. Dietary \\uf062-ionone failed to affect growth performance and the plasma lipid profile, irrespective of whether the diet was cholesterol free or rich in cholesterol. \\r\\nThe question then addressed was whether dietary essential oils (thymol, cinnamaldehyde, CRINA\\uf0d2 Poultry) could antagonize the negative effect of CMC on growth performance in broilers. Intestinal viscosity was increased by CMC inclusion, but was not lowered by dietary essential oils. However, addition of cinnamaldehyde and CRINA\\uf0d2 Poultry to the CMC diet tended to counteract the negative effect on growth performance. Fat digestibility was reduced by CMC, but cinnamaldehyde and CRINA\\uf0d2 Poultry partially relieved the CMC-induced inhibition of fat digestion. This study indicates that cinnamaldehyde and CRINA\\uf0d2 Poultry, but not thymol, may antagonize the negative effect of CMC on growth performance which may relate to improving fat digestibility. \\r\\nIn following study, we observed whether dietary essential oil components, i.e., thymol, cinnamaldehyde and CRINA\\uf0d2 Poultry could have effects on growth performance, fat digestibility, and intestinal viscosity in female broiler chickens fed on rye. Feeding rye to chicken lowered weight gain, elevated intestinal viscosity and reduced fat digestibility. Addition of dietary cinnamaldehyde to rye diet partially counteracted rye-suppressed weight gain in female broiler chickens. However, intestinal viscosity and fat digestion were not modified by dietary cinnamaldehyde. The partial counteraction of dietary cinnamaldehyde on rye-induced growth depression seemed to be mediated by concomitant increase in feed intake, however underlying mechanisms remain unknown. \\r\\nIt would expect that a mixture of essential oil components could act synergistically on growth performance. Carvacrol and cinnamaldehyde were selected based on earlier studies. In addition, CMC was included to enhance treatment contrasts. Individual components when supplemented to the CMC diet had no apparent effects on growth performance. On the other hand, a mixture of carvacrol and cinnamaldehyde added to CMC diet significantly impaired growth performance of the chickens. This latter study suggests that a certain combination of two or more essential oil components can impair growth performance of chickens when birds are fed a diet with the soluble fiber, CMC. \\r\\nIt is generally concluded that dietary essential oil components have potential to improve performance of broiler chickens. However, the consistently alleged hypocholesterolemic effects of dietary essential oil components were not observed. Based on the present work, future studies with dietary essential oil components should focus on identifying synergistic effects of different essential oil components and their application to animal production.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Although mechanical ventilation is a life-saving procedure at the intensive care unit, it may exacerbate or even induce damage to the lung itself (ventilator-induced lung injury, VILI). Mechanical ventilation destabilizes alveolar-capillary barriers thereby leading to protein-rich edema formation and impaired gas exchange. It has been thought that cell death and loss of cell integrity are important in the ventilator-induced disruption of alveolar-capillary barriers. We observed that necrosis, and not apoptosis, is the major executive mechanism of cell death in our model of VILI. Moreover, we showed that mechanical ventilation causes significant changes in the angiopoeitin-Tie2 system which is involved in the maintenance of endothelial cell integrity. These data imply that the angiopoietin-Tie2 system and necrotic cell death may be crucial in the development of VILI. An intriguing clinical observation is that most ventilated critically-ill patients do not succumb to acute lung failure but to multiple organ failure (MOF). In this respect, we showed that mechanical ventilation increased the pro-inflammatory state of the lung but also of organs distal to the lung, like liver and kidney. These data indicate that alveolar stretch due to mechanical ventilation may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of MOF. The main focus was to evaluate whether different therapeutic interventions protect against various aspects of VILI like inflammation, protein-rich edema formation and impaired gas exchange. It has been recognized that granulocytes and inflammatory mediators play an essential role in the pathogenesis of VILI. Consequently, anti-inflammatory agents like dexamethasone have been used to attenuate or prevent detrimental effects induced by mechanical ventilation. Although dexamethasone effectively inhibits ventilator-induced lung inflammation, systemic administration may cause severe side effects like increased blood glucose levels. Drug delivery systems aimed at preventing these unwanted systemic side effects could therefore be of therapeutic importance. We showed that liposome-encapsulated dexamethasone was capable of inhibiting important parameters of ventilator-induced lung inflammation. Since lung inflammation may precede injury, we investigated if the anti-inflammatory action of dexamethasone could diminish protein-rich edema formation and impaired gas exchange. These more ‘crude’ parameters of VILI however were not affected by dexamethasone treatment. Furthermore, we examined if treatment with angiopoietin (Ang)-1 (Tie2 receptor agonist) protects against the detrimental effects of mechanical ventilation. We observed that Ang-1 inhibited granulocyte infiltration and inflammatory mediator expression induced by mechanical ventilation. Nonetheless, Ang-1 did not prevent protein-rich edema formation and impaired gas exchange induced by mechanical ventilation. Taken together, we propose that prevention of lung inflammation does not preclude a loss of pulmonary function in our experimental model of VILI. In this respect, we would like to propose that anti-inflammatory agents should not be used to combat the mechanosensitive aspects of VILI. However, anti-inflammatory therapy may well be considered when inflammation is the primary inducer of lung injury, like in non-ventilated patients diagnosed with inflammatory lung diseases. Finally, the findings in this thesis suggest that future therapeutic interventions in the ventilated, critically-ill patient should aim at attacking the ventilator-induced impairment of alveolar-capillary barrier function for instance with inhibitors of necrosis'],\n",

The health benefits of such interventions are achieved in transfusion recipients and thus depend on their profiles: age, gender, life expectancy after transfusion, hospital diagnosis, and number and type of blood products received. Twenty hospitals in the Netherlands provided information on blood products transfused between 1996 and 2006, resulting in the first national dataset containing characteristics of blood product recipients in the Netherlands.

       "  'Description': ['The aim of this thesis was to evaluate the clinical impact of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA] infections on the total burden of disease. A guideline on empirical antimicrobial eradication of MRSA in carriers was developed based on a systematic review of literature. A distinction was made between uncomplicated and complicated carriage depending on presence or absence of skin lesions, foreign body material, mupirocin resistance or detection of MRSA exclusively outside the nose. First choice empirical treatment in uncomplicated carriage is a combination of mupirocin nasal ointment and disinfecting soap. First choice empirical treatment in complicated carriage is mupirocin nasal ointment and disinfecting soap together with a combination of two antibiotics. We evaluated the effectiveness of this guideline in a prospective cohort study in 18 Dutch centres. Eradication occurred more frequently among those treated according to the guideline. However, adding systemic antibiotic therapy to topical treatment in all patients with extranasal carriage, chronic pulmonary disease or ADL-dependence may further increase treatment success. We quantified changes in annual trends of nosocomial bacteraemias [NB] in a Dutch tertiary care centre. We concluded that the incidence density is sensitive to changes in hospital number of patient-days over time and most accurately reflects the risk per day in the hospital. We hypothesized that an increased incidence density of NB caused by MRSA was associated with a reduced incidence of NB caused by other pathogens, resulting in similar trends in total incidence rates of NB in hospitals with and without MRSA endemicity. We therefore calculated annual incidence densities of NB of MRSA and all other pathogens in 7 hospitals with, and 5 hospitals without emergence of MRSA from 1998 through 2007. Originating from a comparable total burden of NB in 1998, the incidence density of MRSA and non-MRSA antibiotic-resistant bacteria increased more in MRSA endemic hospitals, resulting in a 29% higher total burden of NB after 10 years, demonstrating that emergence of infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria occurs in addition to infections caused by antibiotic-susceptible bacteria. We quantified inadequate antibiotic therapy for S. aureus bacteraemia in Western Europe and aimed to identify determinants of inadequate treatment and variables associated with 30-day mortality by including all adult patients with S. aureus bacteraemia in 60 randomly selected hospitals over a period of two months. 21% of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus [MSSA] bacteraemias received inadequate empirical therapy, versus 28% of MRSA bacteraemias. Neither inadequate empirical treatment nor methicillin resistance was associated with 30-day mortality. We aimed to quantify the risk of mortality associated with MRSA versus MSSA bacteraemia, and to determine the effect of confounding factors hereon in a meta-analysis of observational studies. Comorbidity, severity of illness at onset of bacteraemia and appropriateness of treatment were considered the most important confounders. In 73 studies the unadjusted attributable mortality risk for mortality due to a bacteraemia caused by a MRSA versus MSSA was 13%. In 35 studies that adjusted for confounders the adjusted attributable mortality risk decreased to 9%. Finally, 7 studies that adjusted for the three key confounding variables yielded an attributable mortality risk of 4%.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The aim of the studies described in the thesis was to study the functioning of patients with CIDP, MMN, or CIAP, and the determinants of their functioning. Specific research questions were: 1. What are the functional health profiles of patients with different inflammatory polyneuropathies (CIDP and MMN), and do these profiles reveal relevant determinants that can be studied further? 2. How can these determinants be assessed, i.e., what type of clinimetric instruments could be of value in these populations? 3. What are the functional health profiles of patients with CIAP and MMN established with these instruments? 4. What other determinant(s) might influence the functioning of patients with CIAP? The functional health profiles of patients with CIDP and MMN were investigated in a cross-sectional study on the basis of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) framework of the World Health Organization. The problems patients experienced in daily life were used to identify specific determinants of functioning and appropriate performance-based instruments. It was clear that dexterity and walking ability could be determinants of the functioning of patients with polyneuropathy. Because there are no specific instruments to assess dexterity and walking ability in these patients, the Sequential Occupational Dexterity Assessment (SODA) and the modified Shuttle Walk Test (SWT) were chosen as potentially relevant tests. The SODA has earlier been shown to be a valid tool to assess dexterity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Because the SWT was originally developed to assess functional capacity in patients with chronic airway obstruction and heart failure, the test was validated for the assessment of walking ability in patients with CIAP and MMN. Subsequently, the functional health profiles of patients with CIAP and MMN were assessed with the SODA and validated SWT, with help of the ICF. Functional health profiles differed between the patient groups. In addition to the functional health profiles derived from our studies, clinical experience has shown that pain might also be a determinant of the functioning of patients with CIAP. However, little is known about specific aspects of pain and its association with health-related quality of life. The pain patients experience was investigated in detail, using the generic McGill Pain Questionnaire. In summary, functional health profiles were established for patients with CIDP, MMN, and CIAP, and relevant determinants and performance-based instruments were selected. Functional health profiles differed between the patient groups. These findings indicated that it is essential to use performance-based tests in order to be able to assess problematic activities in detail. Effective methods to assess the pain experienced by patients with CIAP, and to assess balance in patients with CIDP and CIAP, are needed. The validated SWT proved to be of value in all patient groups, providing broad insight into patients’ walking ability, and is a welcome new test for clinical use. However, the clinimetric properties of the SODA and SWT still have to be determined. Future studies have to be developed to tailor medical and rehabilitation therapy aimed at improving the functional health of patients with polyneuropathy.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Chronic HCV aff ects millions of people worldwide with major impact on the morbidity and mortality of the people aff ected. In HCV-infected patients coinfected with HIV, an 156 accelerated progression of liver fi brosis is seen, even with successful suppression of HIV due to combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Current therapeutic regimens with pegIFN-alfa and ribavirin are only moderately successful, especially in “diffi cult to treat” patients with genotype 1 or 4 and with a HIV coinfection. Despite the lack of reliable small animal models, progress has been made with regard to the interplay between pegIFN-alfa and ribavirin on the one hand and HCV and the immune system on the other hand. The studies described in this thesis have contributed in diff erent ways to these issues. The acute HCV cohort study (chapter 3) contradicted earlier theoretical reasoning (chapter 2) about the effi cacy of pegIFN-alfa monotherapy adding important data in favor of using pegIFN-alfa in combination with ribavirin for the treatment of acute HCV in HIV-infected patients (chapter 4). The study evaluating the viral load change in the fi rst 48 hours after the start of pegIFN-alfa/ ribavirin therapy (chapter 5) generated a new hypothesis with regard to the working mechanism of pegIFN-alfa. The immunological studies evaluating the role of HCV-specifi c T-cells in both HCV mono-infected and HIV/ HCV coinfected patients demonstrated that HCV-specifi c T-cells do not seem to be involved in therapy-induced viral clearance (chapter 6 and 7). Finally, higher rates of activated caspase-3, activated caspase-8 and CD95 were observed in chronic HCV-infected patients compared to healthy controls (chapter 8) which leads to new research areas in the fi eld of T-cell apoptosis. In the next couple of years, very exciting new developments are expected in the fi eld of viral hepatitis C. The development of an immunogenic mouse models will revolutionize the research into HCV pathogenesis leading to major improvement in the understanding of HCV cell entry, immune evasion and treatment-induced viral clearance. Furthermore, the introduction of HCV protease- and polymerase-inhibitors will have major therapeutic implications revolutionizing the future anti-HCV therapy in terms of regimen and duration. This will hopefully lead to easy eradication of HCV thereby minimizing its eff ects on the human population'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Patiënten met inflammatoire darmziekte (IBD) hebben een verhoogd risico op het ontstaan van colorectaal carcinoom (CRC; 20-jaars risico 8%). Wij vonden dat het risico op CRC bij patiënten die naast IBD ook bekend zijn met de galwegaandoening primaire scleroserende cholangitis (PSC) nog veel hoger is (20-jaars risico: 31%). Uit een vergelijking van CRCs van PSC-IBD patiënten met die van IBD patiëntenen viel op dat het aandeel van rechtszijdige tumoren in de PSC-IBD groep beduidend hoger was dan in de IBD groep (67% vs. 36%). Daarnaast hebben wij op verschillende manieren gekeken naar de moleculaire achtergrond van sporadische en IBD-(PSC)-gerelateerde CRCs. Microsatelliet instabiliteit werd niet aangetoond bij PSC-IBD-gerelateerde tumoren ondanks de hogere frequentie rechtszijdige tumoren. Ook was er geen verschil in voorkomen van Braf- en Kras-genmutaties en in expressie van verschillende carcinogenese-gerelateerde eiwitten, met uitzondering van Cycline D1, dat minder tot expressie kwam in IBD-CRC. Daarnaast was er meer verlies van SMAD4-expressie in darmtumoren bij IBD. Hypermetylatie kwam vaker voor in sporadische CRC dan bij IBD-CRC. Tenslotte bleek de Wnt-pathway geactiveerd te zijn in normaal colonslijmvlies van IBD-patiënten met elders in het colon CRC, wat duidt op een vroege rol van de Wnt-pathway. Dit past ook bij het zogenaamde ‘field effect’, waarbij normaal weefsel reeds genveranderingen laat zien die er op duiden dat het colon diffuus een verhoogde kans heeft op ontstaan van CRC. Dit proefschrift laat zien dat de verschillen in moleculaire achtergrond tussen sporadische en IBD-tumoren in een laat (invasief) stadium niet meer duidelijk aanwezig zijn. Deze verschillen zijn mogelijk wel aanwezig in een vroeger stadium en kunnen dan geﮤuceerd worden door exogene factoren zoals chronische darmontsteking (IBD) en toxische galzouten (PSC-IBD). Meer kennis over deze factoren kan bijdragen aan een meer individueel gerichte surveillance en wellicht zelfs preventie van CRC bij (PSC-) IBD'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Around half of all men have sexual problems. The main complaints and prevalence are orgasmic disorders (10%), premature ejaculation (PE) (27%), and erectile difficulties (10%). These statistics do not include the sexual side effects of medications such as antidepressants. Research experiments in humans can be very time consuming or unethical. The present thesis deals with the development of an animal (rat) model that has face, predictive, and construct validity towards human sexual behavior and its disorders, and can be used to study the effects but also the side effects of psychoactive drugs on sexual behavior. Sexually trained male rats have stable low, normal or fast ejaculating behaviors. Low ejaculating rats can be used to examine orgasmic problems, while fast ejaculating rats for premature ejaculations. Normal ejaculating rats can be used to investigate side effects of medication (either stimulatory or inhibitory). The animal model provides face and predictive validity to the human situation where the inhibitory effects of SSRIs appear after chronic administration, and not after acute administration. In line with clinical experience, marked blockade of serotonin transporters (SERT) interfered with male sexual behavior, in contrast to the dopamine (DA) and noradrenaline (NA) reuptake inhibitor, bupropion. Further, other drugs that primarily increase levels of DA and NA versus serotonin (5-HT) (the 5-HT1A agonist, buspirone; the triple reuptake inhibitor, DOV216,303 and the 5-HT2C antagonist, S32006) exerted no detrimental influence or a mild stimulatory effect on sexual performance, and they are predicted to have little or no sexual side-effects in men. It is suggested that blockade of DA transporters (DAT) or NA transporters, as well as 5-HT2C receptor blockade, would be a useful avenue for the treatment of antidepressant-induced sexual inhibition. SERT knockout (SERTKO) rats have a permanent disturbance in the serotonergic system and were used to examine the effects of permanently elevated levels of 5-HT in the brain on sexual behaviors. Experiments with SERTKO rats revealed the existence of separate pools of 5-HT1A receptors with varying degree of sensitivity or desensitivity, revealing a possible mechanism underlying sexual dysfunctions. The SERTKO rat would be an interesting animal model to study modulating effects of various drugs on a perturbed serotonergic central nervous system. In addition, a novel use of the antibiotic clavulanic acid was discovered. This drug showed sexual stimulatory activity. A possible underlying mechanism is unknown, but further research on this seems very interesting. The thesis has provided important insights into male sexual function. Our research may lead to help to find new antidepressants without sexual side effects and drugs for the treatment of male sexual dysfunctions'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Insulin therapy in type 2 diabetes patients : balancing between evidence and experience'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['In 2005 we investigated in a questionnaire survey in 1621 general practitioners (GPs) whether the practice organisation in primary care is equipped to provide optimal diabetes care. This was expressed in the Structure Index (SI), based on the presence of practice characteristics (score 0-4.5). The mean SI was 2.10.9 and was higher in training practices and in practices in which GPs started insulin treatment. About 75% of the GPs worked in practices that were average in organisation necessary to provide optimal diabetes care; the rest worked in practices poorly equipped or in practices well equipped to provide such care. In the questionnaire survey, we investigated the organisation of insulin therapy and assessed factors that were associated with providing insulin therapy in type 2 diabetes patients. 67% of the GPs start insulin therapy, especially male GPs and those older than 40, GPs working in a health centre and those working with a practice nurse. GPs working in urban regions less often start insulin. The most often mentioned barriers for starting insulin therapy were lack of knowledge, lack of time and insufficient financial incentives. We compared psychological well-being between type 2 diabetes patients using oral glucose lowering agents and patients on insulin therapy with or without oral agents. Insulin-users reported worse outcomes on Short Form-36 subdomains physical functioning and general health; and on Diabetes Health Profile (DHP) total score, barriers to activity and psychological distress. Insulin regimen and diabetes duration did not influence these outcomes. We reviewed 78 randomised clinical trials regarding insulin preparations in patients with type 2 diabetes. They showed that continuing oral glucose lowering agents after the start of basal insulin therapy resulted in better glycaemic control with less insulin requirements, less weight gain and less hypoglycaemic events than monotherapy. Long-acting insulin analogues were associated with similar glycaemic control, but less hypoglycaemia than NPH insulin. Premix insulin provided better glycaemic control than a basal insulin, but caused more hypoglycaemia. Analogue premix insulin provided similar glycaemic control, but lower postprandial glucose levels compared to human premix insulin. Drawing conclusions from the studies concerning basal-bolus regimen seemed not possible. In a randomised clinical trial 39 type 2 diabetes patients with inadequate glycaemic control on metformin and sulphonylurea, were randomised to continue or discontinue sulphonylurea, once they started insulin glargine therapy and continued metformin. After one year, the combination with sulphonylurea provided no significant differences in C-peptide-glucose ratio, an estimator for ?-cell function, compared to not using sulphonylurea. In the group continuing sulphonylurea the number of hypoglycaemic events was higher and also weight gain was, not statistically significant, higher in this group. We reviewed the effects of insulin monotherapy versus insulin-oral glucose lowering agents combination therapy in type 2 diabetes patients already treated with insulin in 38 randomised clinical trials. The addition of oral agents has positive effects on glycaemic control and insulin requirements. Combination with sulphonylurea or thiazolidinediones causes more hypoglycaemic events, thiazolidinediones more weight gain and metformin less weight gain. Side effects such as gastro-intestinal complaints and oedema also occurs.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Farmers milking dairy cows are obliged to exclude milk with abnormal homogeneity or color for human consumption (e.g., Regulation (EC) No 853/2004), where most abnormal milk is caused by clinical mastitis (CM). With automatic milking (AM), farmers are no longer physically present during the milking process. AM systems use sensors in order to replace the visual monitoring of udder health. Sensor measurements are used by CM detection models as input data to produce mastitis alert lists. These lists report cows suspected of having CM as they deviate, according to the sensor information, from ‘normal’ for one reason or another. It is the responsibility of the dairy farmer to check listed cows visually to confirm CM. Most CM detection models use sensor information of the electrical conductivity as input data. Currently used CM detection models, however, can be improved in order to detect more CM cases and to decrease the number of cows listed on the mastitis list erroneously. The objective was to improve CM detection using sensor data from AM systems by exploring three routes: (1) applying new algorithms, (2) adding new sensor information, and (3) adding non-sensor information. This improved CM detection model should (1) detect CM at high levels of sensitivity (>70%) and specificity (>99%), (2) alert for CM preferably at the quarter milking where clinical signs are visible for the first time, or within a limited time period around this event, (3) be able to deal with field data, and (4) provide information about the CM causal pathogen in order to improve the decision making process regarding antibiotic treatment. Nine Dutch dairy farmers participated in a field study to collect sensor data and visual observations of CM. Sensor measurements were transformed to predictive variables, which were used as input data for the development of a CM detection model with decision tree induction. Detection performance of the developed model (sensitivity 40% at a specificity 99%) was higher compared with models currently used by AM systems. It got close to the required performance levels by increasing the time window in which the model was allowed to alert for a CM event (sensitivity 69.5%, specificity 99%). Sensor data also had potential to differentiate between Gram-positive and Gram-negative CM causal pathogen. Adding information from a new sensor (measuring somatic cell count (SCC)) to a CM detection model that uses sensor measurements of the electrical conductivity improved the detection of CM as well. Despite expectations, adding non-AM cow information (e.g., parity, SCC history, CM history) did not improve detection performance when added to a detection model based on sensor data. The next step in improving CM detection models is gaining insight in the needs of dairy farmers, obtaining international agreements on gold standard definitions, applied time windows, and data inclusion criteria, and collecting a data set from more than one commercial dairy farm where all quarter milkings are checked visually for CM.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['In this thesis two challenges in the treatment of patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) are investigated, safety and efficacy of treatment. Topical corticosteroids have been one of the cornerstones of treatment of AD for more than 40 years. Possible systemic side effects due to absorption of topical corticosteroids are decrease of bone mineral density (BMD) and development of glaucoma and cataract. We found that one third of 125 patients with moderate to severe AD were found to have low BMD. Surprisingly it was predominately males that had a low BMD. In our cross-sectional study there was no difference in the cumulative use of topical corticosteroids in the 5 years prior to investigation, between patients with a low BMD and normal BMD. We did find a trend towards an increased risk of low BMD with higher use of topical and oral corticosteroids. Additionally, the effect of inflammation on BMD was difficult to study but cannot be eliminated as one of the causes of low BMD. In the follow-up study we did not find a significant difference in change of BMD between patients who had used ‘low’ or ‘high’ amounts of topical corticosteroids during two year follow-up. We found only a small decrease in BMD over time. In the study evaluating glaucoma and cataract we found that the use of topical corticosteroids on the eyelids with a mean frequency of 4 days per week for several months was safe and that the use of predominantly class III (European and US classifications) topical corticosteroids with use up to 2400 grams/year did not result in glaucoma or cataract development. In patients with severe AD potent topical corticosteroids may not be sufficient, demanding additional systemic immunosuppressive drugs. The results of a randomised controlled trial comparing Enteric-Coated Mycophenolate Sodium (EC-MPS) to Cyclosporine A (CsA) as maintenance therapy in adult patients with AD show that EC-MPS is clinically effective, has a mild side effect profile and is a good alternative to CsA. At the start of therapy with EC-MPS the clinical effect is delayed, however the clinical remission after stopping EC-MPS lasts longer compared to CsA. Other factors besides disease activity probably influence quality of life (QoL) in AD is a conclusion drawn from the findings that: disease activity correlated better with QoL when disease activity was less severe, that disease extent (‘rule of nines’ score) correlated better with QoL than disease severity, and that an individual’s improvement of 10 points in disease activity was accompanied by only a small improvement in QoL. We assessed soluble CD30 and thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC) as disease activity markers for AD during the use of EC-MPS and CsA. We found a positive correlation between sCD30 and disease activity (objective SCORAD) during maintenance therapy with CsA. However, during EC-MPS maintenance therapy there was no correlation between sCD30 and disease activity. We found that serum TARC levels and objective SCORAD correlated during both maintenance-therapy regimens.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The heart is able to adapt to new, often pathologic, conditions, so-called cardiac remodeling. Although initially adequate, these adaptations could can become maladaptive over time. One of the adaptations of the heart during pathology is ventricular hypertrophy, which may go hand in hand with an increased risk of fatal ventricular arrhythmias. Moreover, ventricular hypertrophy may deteriorate into heart failure. Both compensated ventricular hypertrophy and heart failure are accompanied by a significant risk for sudden cardiac death, attributable to ventricular arrhythmias. In this thesis, we sought to elucidate underlying molecular, cellular, and structural mechanisms leading to increased susceptibility to fatal ventricular arrhythmias during the process of cardiac remodeling, with a focus on the determinants of impulse propagation. A variety of models (see below) has been used 1) to cover various stages of remodeling and 2) to obtain a more solid basis for extrapolation to human cardiac disease. In the calcineurin mouse (MHC-CnA), a model of artificially induced hypertrophy, impairment of conduction was associated with severe diminution of Nav1.5, Cx43 and Cx40 protein expression. Downregulation of Nav1.5 and Cx40 protein expression, however, was accounted for by a transcriptional mechanism. Protein reductions were accompanied by a decreased mRNA of Nav1.5 and Cx40, but not Cx43. The latter was accounted for by a post-transcriptional mechanism. Increased collagen deposition in the heart occurs during aging. A senescent mouse model showed that prevention of fibrosis by chronic RAAS inhibition resulted in an anti?arrhythmogenic effect. In addition, in treated mice, lower arrhythmogeneity was directly correlated to a reduced amount of patchy fibrosis. Longitudinal characterization in a murine chronic pressure overload model of compensated and decompensated hypertrophy (TAC, transverse aortic constriction) showed a rapid evolution of structural and electrical remodeling. TAC mice showed an increased vulnerability to induced ventricular arrhythmias, which were related to heterogeneous expression of Cx43. In heart failure patients, a heterogeneous distribution of Cx43 was also associated with a history of serious ventricular arrhythmias. Heterogeneous Cx43 distribution may lead to functional block and unstable reentry, giving rise to polymorphic ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Detailed 3D mapping in the chronic atrioventricular block (CAVB) dog, model of compensated hypertrophy, revealed focal activity to be the dominant mechanism involved in perpetuation of ibutilide induced TdP. This was in line with the frequent observation of a focal origin of activation during TdP and scanty electrophysiological changes in favor of reentry. In TAC rats, a pressure overload model of compensated hypertrophy, transmural conduction was impaired, which was related to a decreased total amount of Cx43 combined with increased heterogeneity of Cx43 expression and partial substitution with non-phosphorylated Cx43. In this model, these alterations resulted in polymorphic VTs. Virtually all results point out that a heterogeneous distribution of Cx43 generates a major arrhythmogenic substrate, both in the animal models and in heart failure patients. Cx43 heterogeneity correlated well with dispersed impulse conduction and increased arrhythmia inducibility. Therefore, spatial distribution of Cx43 might be a novel diagnostic tool in the identification of increased arrhythmia vulnerability in patients. Additionally, spatial Cx43 distribution might provide a new therapeutic target in the diseased myocardium'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The thesis ‘ Skills for Life programs in school’ treats the theoretical foundations, design and evaluation of school-based Skills for Life programs, aimed at promoting social and emotional skills in children and adolescents. More specifically, the formation and development iterations of a Dutch Skills for Life program, named ‘Levensvaardigheden’ [Dutch for Skills for Life], are followed over 14-year period. ‘Levensvaardigheden’ was implemented in the city of Rotterdam and is aimed at children and youths aged 13 to 17. It is based on the social cognitive learning theory and the Rational Emotive Therapy. Since its inception in 1997, on request of the municipality of Rotterdam, the program underwent several improvements based on practical experience and evaluative research. The thesis describes four effect studies of the ‘Levensvaardigheden’ program and the improvements that resulted from these studies, over the years from 1997 to 2004. Based on the results of these studies, the lesson curriculum, teacher training and also the study design were amended. The third and fourth studies show that ‘Levensvaardigheden’ has positive short-term and long-term effects on general belief in self-efficacy, ability to express negative emotions, and intention to use social and emotional skills. The studies also indicate positive short-term effects on self-esteem and suicidality. The thesis also summarises the current state of knowledge of effectiveness of Skills for Life programs, and of the characteristics of effective programs. The reviewed meta-analyses and studies showed that Skills for Life programs promote social and emotional skills; reduce or prevent antisocial behaviour; stimulate a positive self-image; and reduce or prevent mental problems and depression. The reviews also indicate improved academic performance and a more positive attitude towards school in students who had completed a Skills for Life program. Additionally, from the reviewed meta-analyses and studies could be distilled certain characteristics of effective programs. These characteristics were used for the design of a new version of ‘Levensvaardigheden’. The following attributes emerged from the review: ‘interactive didactic methods’; ‘a theoretical foundation’; ‘teaching inter– and intrapersonal skills first in general, then in problem-specific situations’; ‘training the trainers/teachers’; ‘use of supportive environment strategies’; ‘duration and intensity of the program’; and ‘design and development of the program in co-operation with the target groups’. The new version of ‘Levensvaardigheden’ is currently under study by a joint venture of the Hague University, TNO-Quality of Life and the Netherlands Institute for Health Promotion, NIGZ. The final chapter of this thesis summarises the questions that could not (yet) be answered, or not be answered completely. The studies presented in this thesis show that Skills for Life programs do make a positive and effective contribution to the reduction and prevention of problem behaviour and the promotion of prosocial behaviour in children and youths. They also improve academic performance and result in children and youth better enjoying school. This results may perchance be a motivation for schools to combine academics and social and emotional skills education, and thus have the best of both worlds'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The overall aim of this thesis was to evaluate adverse effects of ultraviolet irradiation (UV) in atopic dermatitis (AD). We focused on the two important adverse effects of UV: photosensitivity and skin cancer risk associated with calcineurin inhibitor treatment. In chapter 2 and 3 we found that photosensitivity affects approximately 3% of our AD population, being mainly females. Phototesting distinguishes two photosensitivity reaction patterns. Based hereupon, patients were diagnosed with photosensitive AD (PhAD) or AD with co-existing polymorphic light eruption (AD + PLE). Children with AD and photosensitivity showed the same two clinical reaction patterns as demonstrated in adults in the same 50-50% ratio. In chapter 4, we analyzed the inflammatory cell infiltrate after a single UVB irradiation in these two patient groups compared to non-photosensitive AD patients. There was no difference between the 3 groups concerning the influx of neutrophils, eosinophils and T-cells, the degranulation of mast cells or the quantity of epidermal dendritic cells. In chapter 5 we described a digital quantification method for immunohistochemical assessment of UV induced thymine cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (TT-CPDs) in human skin. This method increased the linear measurement range compared to visual assessment and hence improved immunohistochemical quantification of DNA photo damage; it is more sensitive and efficient in measuring the extent of DNA-damage per nucleus. This method was eventually used to assess the difference in UV induced DNA damage repair in AD patients treated with either topical triamcinolone acetonide 0,1 % ointment (classic corticosteroid) or tacrolimus 0,1 % ointment (calcineurin inhibitor) described in chapter 6. Our study did not show differences in DNA damage repair rate of topical tacrolimus treated skin after a single UVB irradiation in human AD skin compared to non-treated or triamcinolone treated skin.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Adequate detection of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in patients who present with persistent cough in general practice is highly warranted, because targeted interventions for COPD (notably smoking cessation programmes) improve the quality of life. Nevertheless, much is unknown about the diagnostic value of tests that are usually included in the diagnostic workup in suspected COPD in primary care, including symptoms and signs. Whether and to what extent COPD can be excluded or diagnosed by history taking and physical examination is unknown, as is the added diagnostic value of spirometry by general practitioners (GPs). The independent value of other potentially useful diagnostic tests, such as level of C-reactive protein (CRP) and reversibility testing after an oral corticosteroid test, has also never been reported. Persistent cough is one of the most frequent complaints in general practice which underlines that diagnostic strategies for COPD in these patients should be efficient and evidence based. The study aims of this thesis were to quantify the diagnostic value of different (combinations of) diagnostic tests in middle aged and elderly patients suspected of COPD, i.e., those consulting their GP because of persistent cough. 400 patients were included in a diagnostic study in the Netherlands performed between 2006 and 2009. They underwent an extensive diagnostic work-up for COPD, including standardised history taking and physical examination, as well as secondary care lung function tests. An expert panel finally determined the presence or absence of COPD (reference test), and found that 118 patients (30 %) had COPD. History taking and physical examination items with independent diagnostic value were increasing age, male gender, current smoking, > 20 pack years of smoking, a history of cardiovascular disease, wheezing complaints, diminished breath sounds and wheezing on auscultation. A multivariable score combining these items was accurate for excluding COPD (the negative predictive value of a low score was 92 %). This score had additional diagnostic value beyond the physician’s own initial clinical estimation of the probability of COPD. Adding spirometry results obtained by the GP to the before mentioned history and physical examination substantially improved diagnostic risk classification for COPD. CRP levels on the other hand had no clinically relevant added value. The diagnostic value of a prednisolone test for excluding or diagnosing COPD was also studied in 233 study patients with persistent cough. All subjects used a 14 day prednisolone test of 30 milligram per day including before and after measurement of the post bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1). The prednisolone test result was defined positive if the FEV1 exceeded 200 ml or 12 % of the baseline value. A positive test result was associated with COPD, but had no value in addition to more easily obtainable diagnostic information. In the general discussion, implications for clinical practice and future research, in the view of our main finding were debated.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Chronic joint disorders are a major cause of impaired mobility and loss of quality of life in both humans and horses. Regardless of the primary insult, any joint disorder is characterized by an upset in normal joint homeostasis, the balance between tissue anabolism and catabolism that is normally maintained by resident articular cells. This upset is often fuelled by a local inflammatory response in the synovial membrane and the articular cartilage. Our current understanding of the pathogenesis of chronic joint disease is hampered by a lack of tools for the accurate assessment of joint homeostasis. This thesis explores the analysis of direct (cartilage components) and indirect biomarkers (paracrine effectors like cytokines, inflammatory mediators and catabolic enzymes) in synovial fluid from horses with naturally occurring and experimentally induced disease as a means to study real-time changes in the intra-articular environment. Clinical investigations in joints with osteochondrosis and early osteoarthritis identified differences in cartilage turnover and growth factor concentrations in young foals, but not older horses, with osteochondrosis compared to age-matched control animals, while cartilage markers did not differ between lame horses with and without clinically detectable joint pain. Importantly however, all clinically active joints were characterized by a significant level of ongoing inflammation, even in conditions like osteochondrosis that are not usually considered inflammatory in nature. Synovial inflammation was evidenced by elevated concentrations of specific local mediators like substance P in painful joints, prostaglandin E2 in lame horses and leukotriene B4 and prostaglandin E2 in horses with clinical osteochondrosis. Cross-sectional studies of natural disease are marred by numerous confounding factors that may obscure relations between marker concentrations and disease status. To investigate the impact of primary inflammation on in vivo cartilage turnover and to study the time course of early inflammatory and degradative events within the joint space, a longitudinal experimental approach was adopted. Fully reversible acute synovitis was induced in joints of healthy horses by injection of 0.5 nanogram lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and synovial fluid biomarkers were monitored over the course of the local inflammatory response. By adopting a cross-over design for these studies, longitudinal monitoring of synovial fluid marker markers could simultaneously be used for the in vivo evaluation of effects of commonly used therapeutics (oral administration of an NSAID and intra-articular injection of morphine) within the joint space, compared to placebo treatment. These studies showed that inflammatory mediator and cytokine release (bradykinin, substance P, prostaglandins, HETEs, HMGB-1) as well as Matrix Metalloproteinase activity rose rapidly after the onset of inflammation. Also, both anabolic and catabolic markers of proteoglycan and type II collagen, each with their own time course, peaked in response to primary joint inflammation. Oral administration of an NSAID proved to reduce a host of lipid and peptide synovial inflammatory mediators, but also to limit the inflammation-induced rises in MMP activity and cartilage turnover markers, while morphine showed local anti-inflammatory effects but did not reduce the accompanying peaks in cartilage turnover markers. Altogether, this work demonstrates the potential for synovial fluid biomarkers as relatively non-invasive research tools and surrogate outcome measures for in vivo monitoring of effects of novel or existing therapeutic interventions for the treatment of joint disease'],\n",

The presence of active disease is currently based on several parameters such as symptoms, clinical findings, the serum markers angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R), chest radiography, pulmonary function tests (PFT) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). However, a gold standard for the assessment of active disease is unavailable. Therefore, the use of ¹⁸F-fluorodeoxyglucose (¹⁸F-FDG) PET in the assessment of sarcoidosis activity was evaluated and compared with the aforementioned markers for active disease. The following conclusions may be drawn from the studies described in this thesis: Compared to 67Ga scintigraphy, ¹⁸F-FDG PET is more sensitive in assessing sarcoidosis activity and demonstrates a higher inter observer agreement ¹⁸F-FDG PET appears more sensitive than genotype corrected ACE and sIL-2R in determining the presence of active disease The degree of metabolic activity in the pulmonary tract imaged by ¹⁸F-FDG PET and expressed as maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), correlates with the CD4+/CD8+ ratio and neutrophils in BAL In untreated patients, the absence of parenchymal activity imaged by ¹⁸F-FDG PET correlates with stable pulmonary function tests after one year, while diffuse parenchymal activity predicts a decrease in diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) In patients with diffuse parenchymal activity imaged by ¹⁸F-FDG PET, pulmonary function tests improve by using immunosuppressive therapy, suggesting that ¹⁸F-FDG PET presents the possible improvement that can be achieved In chronic sarcoidosis patients treated with infliximab, changes in ¹⁸F-FDG PET correlate with the clinically observed response In chronic sarcoidosis patients, the change in SUVmax of the lung parenchyma correlates with the change in vital capacity (VC) attained by infliximab therapy An ¹⁸F-FDG PET based classification system of sarcoidosis incorporating four major phenotypic presentations is reproducible.'],\n",

Earlier studies in adolescents and young adults, have found correlations between an inactive lifestyle and lower levels of aerobic fitness. A second important issue being raised in this chapter is that of raised levels of energy cost of locomotion; with ambulation levels decreasing during the teenage years in many ambulatory children with SB, reducing energy cost of locomotion could be beneficial for this group of children. The two factors are combined in the hypothesis of “diminished physiologic reserve”; this study builds on this hypothesis in that with improving aerobic fitness, and/or decreasing energy cost of locomotion, walking will become easier for ambulatory children with SB. Many ambulatory children with (SB) experience functional decline in ambulation despite stable or even improving motor exams. Improving or maintaining low energy cost of locomotion during childhood and throughout the teenage years, could be an important goal for children with SB. The last study describes the effects of a home-based treadmill training program on both ambulatory measures and aerobic fitness. The training consisted of intervals of different speeds, increasing throughout the 12 week period based on fatigue and heart rate intensity during exercise. Results show the intervention to be effective for both short term and long term outcomes regarding walking, with short term effects for aerobic fitness in ambulatory children with SB.

       "  'Description': ['Descending thoracic aortic catastrophes include a variety of acute pathologies of the descending thoracic aorta, which are all associated with high morbidity and mortality rates, requiring immediate intervention. For this thesis, we explored the management and outcomes of several thoracic aortic catastrophes, including traumatic thoracic aortic injury, ruptured descending thoracic aortic aneurysm, acute type B aortic dissection, and aortobronchial and aortoesophageal fistulas. Open surgical repair has been the traditional treatment of these thoracic aortic catastrophes but thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) recently offers a less invasive alternative for the management of thoracic aortic disease. Our studies showed that TEVAR for ruptured descending thoracic aortic aneurysms and traumatic thoracic aortic injuries significantly reduced the short-term morbidity and mortality rates compared with traditional open surgery. Endovascular repair of ruptured descending thoracic aortic aneurysms was however associated with a considerable incidence of peri-procedural stroke as well. In a different study we found that elderly patients were at increased risk for stroke, while the incidence of stroke has decreased over the years. The optimal management of acute type B aortic dissection, another aortic catastrophe, mainly depends on the presentation of the patient. We found that definitive medical management of uncomplicated acute type B aortic dissection is associated with low in-hospital mortality, however, those patients with recurrent pain or refractory hypertension have a much higher mortality rate. An aortic intervention is generally indicated if acute type B aortic dissection is associated with complications, such as acute renal failure, visceral ischemia, limb ischemia, paraplegia, or aortic rupture. Advanced age appeared to be a strong risk factor for mortality among patients with complicated acute type B aortic dissection, irrespective of the management type. For patients with aortobronchial fistulas, TEVAR appeared as a definite treatment, associated with lower mortality compared with traditional results of open surgery. After TEVAR for aortoesophageal fistulas, however, additional esophageal surgery was often needed to treat the fistula. In a meta-analysis of the literature, we found that patients with aortoesophageal fistulas that did not undergo esophageal repair after TEVAR had a significantly increased mortality rate during follow-up, primarily due to infective complications from the persistent connection with the esophagus. TEVAR of thoracic aortic catastrophes is still associated with considerable rates of endograft-related complications during follow-up, such as endoleak in 5% to 30. Thoracic aortic catastrophes are often associated with considerable blood loss and hypovolemic shock. We studied the impact of hypovolemia on the aortic dimensions, and the potential implications for the endovascular management of acute thoracic aortic disease. In an experimental porcine model and in a study of hemodynamically unstable trauma patients, we found that the aortic dimensions could decrease during hypovolemic shock. This could result in undersizing of the endograft using the pre-operative CT scan and a subsequently increased risk of endoleaks. Therefore, increased oversizing of the endograft or additional aortic imaging after fluid resuscitation for more adequate aortic measurements may be required in hypovolemic patients with acute thoracic aortic disease requiring TEVAR.'],\n",

A limited ‘window of implantation’ ensures coordinated embryonic and endometrial development, thereby minimizing the risk of late implantation of compromised embryos. In this thesis we investigate the emerging evidence indicating that RPL is associated with impaired differentiation of endometrial stromal cells into specialized decidual cells. From a functional perspective, this differentiation process, termed decidualization, is not only critical for placental development but also signals the end of the implantation window and bestows on the endometrium the ability to recognize, respond to and eliminate implanting compromised embryos. Thus, we propose that spontaneous decidualization of the human endometrium, which inevitably causes menstrual shedding in the absence of a viable conceptus, serves as functional “window for natural embryo selection”. Conversely, impaired decidualization predisposes to late implantation, negates embryo quality control, and causes early placental failure, regardless of the embryonic karyotype. This pathological pathway also explains the common observation that many RPL patients seem exceptionally fertile, often conceiving within one or two cycles. Thus, as the clinical correlate of inappropriate uterine receptivity, ‘superfertility’ should be considered as a genuine reproductive disorder that requires targeted intervention.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The prevalence of obesity, defined as a body mass index (BMI) of ?30, and type 2 diabetes is rising rapidly worldwide. It is therefore important to study the underlying, etiologic mechanisms of obesity and type 2 diabetes to gain insight into their development, which could eventually lead to preventive strategies and we have studied genetic variation and dietary intake in relation to adiposity, obesity and type 2 diabetes. We also investigated the value of adding genetic variation to non-genetic risk factors for type 2 diabetes. We described the relation between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 1 (PTPN1) gene and macronutrient intake, measures of adiposity, including visceral fat, and cholesterol. We found no statistically significant associations for SNPs in the PTPN1 gene with any dietary phenotypes or measures of obesity. However, our results suggest that SNPs in the PTPN1 gene are associated with total plasma and LDL cholesterol levels. We confirmed some of the findings for 12 obesity loci associated with general adiposity in healthy Dutch women. Seven SNPs were associated (p<0.05) with weight, BMI, and waist circumference (unadjusted for BMI). They were in or near six loci: FTO, MC4R, KCTD15, MTCH2, NEGR1, and BDNF. Five of the SNPs were associated with dietary intake (p<0.05), which were in or near five loci: SH2B1 (particularly with increased fat), KCTD15 (particularly with carbohydrate intake), MTCH2, NEGR1, and BDNF. Our results suggested that these loci are not specifically associated with abdominal adiposity, but more generally with obesity and some of the SNPs were associated with macronutrient-specific food intake. We aimed to clarify the role of dietary patterns in the development of type 2 diabetes in overweight and obese individuals. Two main dietary patterns were defined: a Mediterranean-like pattern and a Snack pattern. Scoring on the Mediterranean-like pattern was not associated with type 2 diabetes risk, whereas a high score on the Snack pattern was associated with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes (HR Q4 versus Q1 (95%CI): 1.70 (1.31; 2.20), ptrend=<0.0001), particularly among less active individuals (less active: HR Q4 versus Q1 (95% CI): 2.14 (1.48; 3.09), ptrend=0.00004, more active: HR Q4 versus Q1 (95%CI): 1.35 (0.93; 1.97), ptrend=0.01; pinteraction=0.02). Our findings support the view that a dietary pattern quantitatively and qualitatively characterized by snacking increases the risk of type 2 diabetes in overweight and obese subjects, especially in physically less active subjects. At last, we investigated the added value of genetic risk factors in predicting type 2 diabetes according to the latest methodological standards of prediction research. Comparison of models 1a (only clinical variables) and 1b (clinical and genetic variables) resulted in a net reclassification improvement (NRI) of 4.6% (p=0.019). For models 2a (only clinical variables) and 2b (clinical and genetic variables), the NRI was 3.6% (p=0.031). In conclusion, adding genetic variants to phenotype-based risk models for type 2 diabetes improves the reclassification in type 2 diabetes case prediction. However, the discrimination was scarcely improved.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The aim of this dissertation is to describe the preparation and characterization of a holmium-loaded radioablation device: holmium acetylacetonate microspheres (HoAcAcMS). This device is to be injected directly into unresectable, chemorefractory, solid tumors, a technique referred to as (interstitial) brachytherapy. The element holmium is ideally suited for this type of therapy, because it can be visualized in vivo using both nuclear imaging, X-ray computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Since the injection volume is limited in solid tumors, the activity per sphere should be as high as possible. The holmium content of the HoAcAc microspheres is 45% by weight, which is considered sufficient for intratumoral radioablation. After incubation for 180 days in phosphate buffer, the release of holmium (3+) from the microspheres was 0.50.2%. Elemental analysis, infrared spectroscopy and time of flight scanning secondary ion mass spectrometry showed that the acetylacetonate in the microspheres was replaced by phosphate within four days, creating a very stable complex. Interestingly, scanning electron microscopy revealed that the particles had retained their size and shape, irrespective of the incubation time, which is an indication that these particles are stable systems. The in vivo stability was assessed after intratumoral administration of 166HoAcAcMS to VX2 carcinoma-bearing rabbits. The holmium content in urine, faeces and blood was below the detection limit, indicating that no holmium had leached from the microspheres. It is concluded that 166HoAcAcMS are highly stable in vivo and can therefore be safely used for radioablation of malignancies. A dose-escalation feasibility study was performed to determine the safety and efficacy of 166HoAcAcMS as a radioablation device in three feline liver cancer patients. Shortly after treatment by intratumoral injections with 166HoAcAcMS, the clinical condition of the cats improved markedly, as did most biochemical and hematological parameters resulting in a meaningful extension of life in all animals. The efficacy of 166HoAcAcMS as a minimally invasive ablation device for renal cell carcinoma was tested in a murine renal cell carcinoma model. The mice of the 166HoAcAcMS group showed an arrest of tumor growth, whereas the tumors in the control group showed an exponential increase in tumor volume. Additionally, the multimodality imaging characteristics were exploited by performing microCT, microSPECT and MR imaging on dedicated animal scanners. All imaging modalities showed a similar distribution of the dose of 166HoAcAcMS. Quantitative analysis of SPECT images, and the possibility to use these images for dosimetry is a fundamental advantage of the 166HoAcAcMS over other ablative techniques. It is concluded that tumor radioablation using 166HoAcAcMS, when injected percutaneously, is feasible and efficacious and not associated with adverse side effects'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['2D-3D image registration in diagnostic and interventional X-Ray imaging'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Clinical procedures that are conventionally guided by 2D x-ray imaging, may benefit from the additional spatial information provided by 3D image data. For instance, guidance of minimally invasive procedures with CT or MRI data provides 3D spatial information and visualization of structures that are not visible with x-ray. Since 3D imaging modalities may not be available during the procedure or require increased patient dose, it is desirable to use pre-interventional/preoperative 3D patient data for guidance that was obtained for diagnosis and treatment planning. To accomplish this, a relationship between patient and image data has to be realized. This relationship can be obtained by 2D-3D image registration. The aim of the research presented in this thesis is to evaluate the performance and limitations of 2D-3D image registration for diagnostic and interventional x-ray imaging, and to develop new methods to overcome these limitations. In Chapter 2 we have compared the registration performance of seven optimization methods in combination with three similarity measures: gradient difference, gradient correlation, and pattern intensity. Optimization methods included in this study were: regular step gradient descent, Nelder-Mead, Powell-Brent, Quasi-Newton, nonlinear conjugate gradient, simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation, and evolution strategy.\\r\\n \\r\\nRegistration experiments were performed on patient data sets that were obtained during cerebral interventions. Various component combinations were evaluated on registration accuracy, capture range, and registration time. The results showed that for the same similarity measure, different registration accuracies and capture ranges are obtained when different optimization methods are used. Overall, it could be concluded that the Powell-Brent is a reliable optimization method for intensity-based 2D-3D registration of x-ray images to CBCT, in terms of accuracy, capture range, and computation time. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn Chapter 3, a relatively computationally inexpensive and robust estimation method is proposed with the objective to enlarge the capture range of 2D-3D registration methods. The method uses the projection-slice theorem in combination with phase correlation in order to estimate the transform parameters, which provides an initialization of the subsequent registration procedure. The method was evaluated as an initialization method for an intensity-based 2D-3D registration method. The uninitialized and initialized registration experiments had success rates of 28.8% and 68.6%, respectively. With these results it was shown that the initialization method based on the projection-slice theorem and phase correlation yields adequate initializations for existing registration methods, thereby substantially enlarging the capture range of these methods. Although spatial information provided by CT during image-guided procedures is substantial, the soft tissue contrast this modality accommodates is rather limited. Availability of MRI data during x-ray-guided procedures may provide such soft tissue contrast. However, registering x-ray images to MRI data is not a trivial task because of their fundamental difference in tissue contrast. In Chapter 4 a technique is presented that generates pseudo-CT data from MRI data, which is sufficiently similar to real CT data as to enable registration of MRI to x-ray. The method was evaluated by comparing registration performance of x-ray to pseudo-CT data to the registration performance of x-ray to real CT data. The results showed that pseudo-CT data facilitates registration of x-ray images to MRI, and that the accuracy achieved was comparable to that of registering x-ray images to CT data. In Chapter 5 the effects of perspective imaging on radiographic measurements were investigated.\\r\\n\\r\\nRadiographic diagnosis and follow-up studies of developmental dysplasia of the hip are\\r\\ncommonly done by measuring the acetabular index on radiographs using Hilgenreiner’s method. The outcome of the measurement, however, depends on the orientation of the subject’s pelvis relative to the x-ray source. The influence of combinations of pelvic rotation and tilt on the systematic error in the acetabular index measurement was investigated in a reproducible way.\\r\\nAdditionally, two ratios Rrotation and Rtilt, evaluating pelvic rotation and tilt, respectively, were measured. The study was done by using digitally reconstructed radiographs of a highresolution 3D CT data set. The results show that the effects of rotation and tilt accumulate and either amplify or counteract the underestimation or overestimation of the acetabular index. For rotations and tilt up to 12 degrees  the average systematic errors in the acetabular index varied from 8.8 degrees◦ underestimation to 4.5 degrees  overestimation. In order to limit the systematic error caused bypelvic misalignment, we advise to consider radiographs acquired with ±4 degrees ◦ rotation and ±4 degrees tilt as acceptable. In our research, these pelvic orientations correspond to Rrotation values between 1.0 and 2.0 and Rtilt values between 1.1 and 1.8. In Chapter 6, the feasibility of obtaining ischemic lesion volumes from CBCT-based CBV measurements was investigated. The reliability of CBCT-assessed CBV was evaluated by characterization of image noise of a flat-panel c-arm CBCT system. CBV of seven canines with unilateral stroke was assessed. Ischemic lesion volumes were calculated by using various lesion thresholds. Volume measurements were evaluated by a regression analysis using gold standard data obtained with histology. From the results it could be concluded that in order for this technique to be applicable in clinical practice, correlation between lesion volumes measured with CBCT-based CBV and histology should be improved. The quality of CBV measurements are limited by imaging physics, and can be improved by reducing detector noise and photon scatter.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['With efficient methodologies available in biotechnology today, increasing numbers of recombinantly manufactured pharmaceutical peptides and proteins are being commercialized. The assessment of biopharmaceutical quality in terms of identity, content and purity is an important issue during manufacturing. The biotechnological production process may show variability, which can introduce product diversity, isoforms and closely-related degradation products. Clearly, there is an increasing demand for suitable analytical methods that allow not only protein and peptide identification, but also the separation and quantification of impurities and possible degradation products Capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS) provides the high separation efficiency and mass-selective detection that can be very useful for biopharmaceutical product characterization. Many protein modifications, like glycosylation and deamidation, may involve changes of net charge of a protein and, thus, also of its electrophoretic mobility. MS detection of high mass accuracy and resolution, such as provided by time-of-flight (TOF) instruments can yield accurate information on the molecular weight of analyzed proteins species. In this thesis, the potential of CE-TOF-MS for the analysis of biopharmaceuticals has been explored. Emphasis was on development of CE methods for basic proteins, paying particular attention to the prevention of protein adsorption, which deteriorates the separation efficiency. A positively charged Polybrene-dextran sulfate-Polybrene (PB-DS-PB) coating was applied for this purpose. These coatings were prepared by successive flushes with solutions of the charged polymers, leading to formation of electrostatically adsorbed layers. The performance and stability of the triple-layer coating was evaluated for basic proteins analyzed at medium and low pH. The suitability of the triple-layer coating for CE-TOF-MS was studied, paying attention to compatibility. CE-MS coupling was achieved via a sheath-liquid interface, and optimum interfacing conditions were investigated. A disadvantage of this type of interfacing is that the sheath liquid dilutes the CE effluent leading to reduced detection sensitivity. In order to avoid this drawback, the performance of a prototype sheathless interface for intact protein analysis by CE-MS was investigated and compared to sheath-liquid CE-MS. The potential of the developed CE-TOF-MS systems was evaluated by analyzing various pharmaceutical proteins, addressing issues such as purity, stability, heterogeneity, and product composition.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['In Chapter I, an outline of this thesis is given. In Chapter 2 we prospectively determined the natural course of pain in patients with conservatively treated acute osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (VCF). In addition, we assessed the type of conservative therapy that these patients received. The natural fracture healing, in terms of pain relief, of an acute, osteoporotic VCF mainly took place within the first 6 months. In view of the high percentage (31%) of patients with chronic pain due to an acute VCF with conservative therapy only, minimal invasive techniques should be considered. In the Netherlands, conservative treatment mainly consists of pain medication and physiotherapy and is prescribed by the general practitioner. In Chapter 3 rationale, objectives and design of the VERTOS II study are described. VERTOS II is an open-label randomized controlled trial comparing percutaneous vertebroplasty (PV) with optimal conservative pain management. In Chapter 4 the main outcomes of the VERTOS II study are analyzed en discussed. Our results show that in patients with acute osteoporotic VCFs who have persistent severe pain, PV done at a mean 5.6 weeks after onset of symptoms resulted in quicker and greater pain relief than conservative treatment did. Pain relief was sustained throughout a year of follow-up. After PV, patients used a lower class of drugs than did those receiving conservative treatment, or no drugs at all. With conservative treatment, pain relief was slower and less than with PV, and pain treatment required tended to increase during the first month. Some patients (24%) in the control group developed chronic back pain, possibly because of non-healing of the fracture. For both quality of life and function, improvement with time was significantly greater and quicker after PV than with conservative treatment. Incremental costs of PV roughly equaled procedural costs. The cost of one pain-free day gained was €20. The trial-based incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for PV, as compared with conservative treatment, was €22,685 per quality adjusted life year gained. The resulting incremental cost-effectiveness suggests that PV seemed warranted for the patients with VCFs treated at a mean 5.6 weeks after start of symptoms. In Chapter 5 we found that the incidence of new VCFs in patients with an acute osteoporotic VCF was not different after PV compared with conservative therapy in the first year of follow-up. The only risk factor for the occurrence of new VCFs was the number of VCFs at baseline indicating the severity of osteoporosis. PV contributed to preservation of stature by decreasing the incidence and severity of further height loss in treated vertebral bodies. In Chapter 6 we assessed the incidence of pulmonary cement embolism by performing native chest CT during follow-up in a large proportion of patients from the VERTOS II trial. Small and clinically silent pulmonary cement embolism occurred in a quarter of patients treated with PV. Cement leakage into the azygos vein was the only risk factor. With time, these small cement emboli remained inert on follow-up CT, without inflammatory pulmonary response. Standard post-procedural CT or chest radiographs are not necessary. In Chapter 7 we assessed the incidence, anatomical location, and clinical impact of perivertebral cement leakage on short- and long-term in a large patient cohort. Cement leakage after PV outside the vertebral body was frequently detected on CT. Most leakages are into adjacent disks or segmental veins and all patients were asymptomatic. Cement leakage occurred more frequently with higher injected volumes. Late cement migration during follow-up did not occur. Standard post-procedural CT of the treated vertebral body in PV is not necessary. In Chapter 8 pain management during PV is evaluated. In a substantial proportion of patients, local anaesthesia was not sufficient for pain reduction during PV. The severity of pain experienced by the patient is usually not appreciated correctly by the operator. In Chapter 9 the results of the VERTOS II study are interpreted and the clinical implications are discussed.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The research described in this thesis focuses on the potential value of early cardiac biomarkers in the diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in the primary care setting, with special attention for point-of-care tests. The design and results of a large diagnostic study on the value of a bedside test for heart-type fatty acid-binding protein (H-FABP) in the diagnosis of ACS in primary care are presented. In 298 consecutive patients suspected of ACS by the GP the H-FABP bedside test (Cardiodetect, cutoff 7 ng/ml) was performed within 24 hours after symptom onset. ACS was present in 66 patients (22%). The overall PPV of H-FABP was 65% (95%CI 50-78) and the NPV was 84% (95%CI 80-88), sensitivity was 43% (95%CI 31-57) and specificity 94% (95%CI 89-97). Adding H-FABP to a diagnostic model of signs and symptoms led to an increase in the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) from 0.66 (95%CI 0.58-0.73) to 0.75 (95%CI 0.68-0.82). Thus, the H-FABP bedside test did provide additional diagnostic certainty in combination with clinical findings. However, the test cannot be used to safely exclude ACS. We recommend use of the test to confirm ACS in patients who were otherwise not referred to hospital by the GP, since the test can be used as an extra precaution not to miss ACS. Median patient delay (defined as the time from onset of symptoms until call for help) was 132 minutes (interquartiel range (IQR) 44 to 360 minutes). Median doctor delay (defined as time from call for help until GP consultation) was 33 (IQR 20 to 55) minutes in men and 45 (IQR 26 to 72) minutes in women (p=0.01). Women reported radiation of chest pain more often than men (68% versus 57%). Thus, in patients suspected of ACS in primary care doctor delay was longer in women than in men, while presenting symptoms of ACS were similar, or even more typical, in women. GPs were asked to estimate the probability (0% to 100%) of the presence of ACS. Comparing the area under the receiver operating curve of the GP estimate and the clinical decision rule (CDR) revealed that the GP more adequately classified patients as ACS or no ACS than the CDR (AUC 0.75 (95%CI 0.68 ; 0.82) and 0.66 (95%CI 0.58 ; 0.73)) respectively. In a classification table for three predefined categories, that is, low, intermediate and high risk (20%), there was a 51% concordance between the risk estimation of the GP and the decision rule. We performed a meta-analysis of 16 diagnostic studies (3709 patients). In the included studies, the prevalence of ACS ranged from 13 to 74%, male gender ranged from 49 to 84%, median age ranged from 64 to 76 years. The summary estimate, calculated using the bivariate random effects approach, was 84% (95% confidence interval (CI) 76-90%) for sensitivity and 84% (95%CI 76-89%) for specificity. Concluding, H-FABP did not fulfil the requirements needed for a safe and early diagnosis of ACS when it was tested as a stand-alone test.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['On the origin of obesity and type 2 diabetes'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['The incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is rising rapidly worldwide and there are already more than 180 million diabetic subjects. T2D risk factors include ethnic background, age, hypertension, overweight, increased abdominal fat, and lack of physical exercise. Obesity is considered to be the most important risk factor for T2D and the main one driving the current epidemic as 90% of T2D patients are obese. Worldwide obesity has also reached epidemic proportions, with 300 million adults classified as clinically obese. T2D and obesity are multifactorial disorders in which both genetic and non-genetic (environmental and lifestyle) factors play a role. The past years has witnessed substantial advances in understanding the genetic basis of obesity and T2D. To date, 17 common obesity loci and 18 common T2D loci have been identified. However, only around 10% of the genetic risk for these traits can be explained. Therefore, many more risk loci for obesity and T2D still need to be discovered. The high prevalence of T2D in many human populations poses a further evolutionary question: Why is the disease so common, when it should disappear as those genetically susceptible to it are removed by natural selection? In the present thesis we focus on (I) evaluating alternative methods to find candidate genes for T2D and obesity, (II) studying genetic and environmental risk factors for T2D and obesity, and (III) studying the origin of the high prevalence of T2D and obesity in modern societies. Both obesity and T2D are complex genetic traits but they share some non-genetic risk factors. In the introduction, chapter 2, we describe the genes recently identified for T2D and obesity by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and evaluate their functions in an effort to determine whether there is any support for the hypothesis that T2D and obesity share some underlying mechanism(s). In the first, methodological, part of the thesis (part I), we use an alternative strategy to find candidate genes for obesity and T2D and explore alternative methods for the investigation of GWAS data to obtain valuable information on the biology and evolutionary origin of T2D. In chapter 3 we combine six tools for disease gene identification to analyse the overlapping T2D and obesity susceptibility loci to pinpoint shared candidate genes for T2D and obesity. In this study, we evaluated alternative methods to study GWAS data. Instead of focusing on the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with the highest statistical significance, we took advantage of prior biological information and tried to detect overrepresented pathways in the GWAS data in chapter 4. We evaluated whether pathway classification analysis can help prioritize the biological pathways most likely to be involved in the disease etiology. Part II of the thesis reports on studies investigating genetic and environmental risk factors for T2D and obesity. In chapter 5 we investigated the role of variants in NPY1R, NPY2R and NPY5R genes, involved in the hypothalamic pathway, in total and nutrient-specific energy intake. In chapter 6, we investigate whether we can replicate the recently reported associations of the susceptibility loci with different obesity related phenotypes and explored the effect of variation in the currently implicated obesity genes affects on dietary energy and macronutrient intake. In chapter 7, we assessed the association between both parity and age at first full-term pregnancy with the risk of T2D in women. The studies, described in part III, aim to investigate the evolutionary explanation of obesity and T2D. In chapter 8 we tested a theory on the evolutionary origin of obesity and T2D, the thrifty gene hypothesis, by investigating whether recently identified T2D and obesity risk alleles have been under recent positive selection. In chapter 9 we investigate whether sub- or infertility predicts later-in-life T2D risk. To investigate body weight from a historical perspective, we studied weight distribution in an 18th century criminal gang (chapter 10). Chapter 11 provides a general discussion on the origin of obesity and T2D.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Monitoring of fetal heart rate and uterine activity'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['In this thesis a renewed monitoring technique for fetal heart rate (FHR) and uterine activity has been investigated. Through non-invasive measurements of electrical signals as recorded from the maternal abdomen, both the fetal-electrocardiogram (fECG) and uterine electrohysterogram (EHG) can be filtered for calculation of FHR and uterine contractions, respectively. This monitoring technique has been known for over 100 years, however due to technical difficulties clinical implementation has not yet been feasible. Recently, thanks to technical improvements, both fECG - and EHG monitoring have experienced a renewed surge of interest. Moreover, the use of fECG - and EHG signals yield more information compared to FHR and uterine activity as acquired with conventional monitoring techniques. For example, the high resolution characteristics of current fECG-monitors offers true beat-to-beat FHR, enabling more specific assessment of the fetal condition in complicated pregnancies. EHG-monitoring holds the promise that it might discriminate between efficient and inefficient contractions, by using power density spectral analysis. Therefore the aims of part I of this thesis were to validate FHR monitoring using the fetal ECG signal and to study the fetal condition in pregnancies complicated by intra uterine growth restriction (IUGR) and (pre)gestational diabetes . The aims of part II of this thesis were to validate monitoring of uterine contractions using EHG during labour by comparing it to the method of reference, intrauterine pressure recording (IUP), and to study whether non-invasive monitoring of uterine activity using EHG may help to differentiate between normal and dysfunctional term labour in nulliparous women. Our studies using fECG have shown that: True beat-to-beat recordings can be obtained throughout pregnancy, also in obese women. Recordings of long duration are feasible during night time when women are asleep. And some promising observations have been made in IUGR fetuses. This indicates that there will be place for this innovative technique. This will hold especially for monitoring of the IUGR fetus and fetuses of women with diabetes, although this has to be substantiated in larger series. Moreover, fECG monitoring is truly non-invasive, again in contrast to conventional Doppler recording. For EHG we conclude that, while still having to standardize the technique, it is now considered accurate for recording of contractions during labour.

       "  'Description': ['The subject of this book is changing interpretations of madness and of the workings of the human mind in early modern times, roughly between 1560 and 1700. This is the very period when modern science arose — an event that has been characterized as ‘the mechanization of the world picture’ or as marking the decline of the magical universe. Labels like these reflect the core of the transition from a magical-religious toward a mechanicist, calculable universe that higher powers have withdrawn from, at least in so far as they had been experienced in earlier times as a living reality. Friedrich Schiller points at this development in a poem on ‘de-deified nature’ (‘Die Götter Griechenlands’); in conscious allusion, Max Weber later dubbed the process ‘the disenchantment of the world’ (‘die Entzauberung der Welt’). In this book we consider, not primarily the transformation of the picture of the world, but of the picture of man (a shorthand term here being used in the comprehensive sense of all human beings, women definitely included). To that end we examine in considerable detail two specific rounds of debate about insanity, possessedness, and witchcraft, such as took place in England at the beginning and at the end of our chosen period. Quite deliberately focusing on the content rather than on the social context of these debates, and taking equally deliberately a heuristic rather than a reductive stance toward our source material, we seek to analyze in depth contemporary developments in diagnostics and in changing concepts of melancholia and hysteria and more generally of how the human mind was thought to operate. Along the way we encounter numerous informative data in detailed, first-hand descriptions made at the time of patients suffering from these various afflictions. We also examine the development over time of theory formation in anatomical and more generally medical treatises, as also in a flourishing genre of (to use the modern term) self-help books. The central question to pose time and again to our late-sixteenth- and mid-seventeenth century debaters, physicians, thinkers and ‘seeers’ is whether visions and trances and ecstatic states are genuine expressions of a supernatural reality, or only of the inside of the human mind — this being quite outspokenly the very question that kept numerous thinking persons at the time profoundly occupied. [Chapter 1] We gain an entrance into pertinent Renaissance patterns of thought by means of an early-17th-century book on love’s sorrows, which points toward the source of human motives as conceptualized at the time; [Chapter 2] Quietly at the background of such traditional conceptions resides something that we call here ‘the architecture of thoughts’. [Chapter 3] All this comes to the fore at a practical level in the persecution of witches and in the expulsion of demons; [Chapter 4] The variety of diagnoses encountered so far on the theoretical level becomes manifest in everyday life in a number of actual cases. We follow contemporary accounts of girls possessed and bewitched, together with the debates carried on among physicians and other people concerned with what is really going on in these cases; [Chapter 5] Theories on how the human mind works underwent a significant development between roughly the Renaissance and William Harvey’s discovery of the circulation of the blood; [Chapter 6] By mid-17th-century the breakthrough toward a scientific approach of man appears to gain momentum; [Chapter 7] In England of the second half of the seventeenth century prominent scholars come to intellectual blows with one another in a second round of debates over witchcraft; [Chapter 8] A quickly decreasing credibility of witches and demons due to the intellectual debates just mentioned also worked out on a more personal level —in diagnostics, in casuistry, and more generally speaking in how individuals experienced phenomena hitherto denoted as supernatural without more ado. [Chapter 9] What did the shift imply for something that we might call our ‘spiritual anatomy’? How have people experienced a soul, or a sense of inspiration? Are our thoughts located in our head, or do they hover around us? [epilogue] The process of disenchantment, partially yet unmistakably brought about by the rise of science of a radically new kind, had effects far beyond the domains of world picture and psychology'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['One of the major side effects of radiotherapy in the head-and-neck area is a reduced saliva production due to the high radiation-sensitivity of the salivary glands. The reduced salivary flow induces difficulties in swallowing, eating, speaking, and often induces dental caries. This thesis addresses the aspects of the radiotherapy treatment of HN cancer patients and the radiation-induced complications of the largest salivary glands, the parotid and submandibular glands. The topics follow the same path as a patient during treatment: from imaging, through radiotherapy planning and the daily treatment, to unfortunately in some cases, radiation-induced xerostomia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) strategies to visualize both the tumour and the salivary glands were explored. The feasibility of perfusion MRI to assess the blood perfusion characteristics of the head-and-neck tumours was investigated. Compared to healthy tissue, the blood perfusion within the tumour was significantly increased. Perfusion MRI was shown to be a promising tool in tumour characterisation and to guide the radiotherapy treatment. As for the salivary glands, MR sialography was used to obtain high-resolution images, which show the outline of the gland as a medium-intense signal with high-intense ducts inside. The MRI images were superior to CT in defining the outline of the submandibular gland, resulting in a significant increase in defined volume and by that a more accurate sparing of the gland. Improvements in the radiotherapy treatment were obtained by adapting the dose distribution to reduce the dose to the salivary glands. An advanced intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) technique was used, resulting in a decrease in mean dose to the submandibular gland of 12 Gy. This amount of reduction will reduce the chance of complication of 85% to 50%. Another improvement in the treatment was accomplished by optimizing the immobilization of the patients during treatment. Patients are treated in daily fractions and differences in patient positioning results in uncertainties in tumour position within the patient. To reduce this uncertainty, patients were immobilized with a special head support and a thermoplastic mask. Improvements in this head support reduced the movement during treatment, resulting in better treatment accuracies. Finally, the chance of developing a complication given a certain dose distribution to the parotid gland was investigated to further improve clinical decision making. To accomplish accurate modelling on a large dataset, a combined dataset of the University Medical Center Utrecht and the University of Michigan Hospital was used. The mean dose was found to be the best prediction dose parameter and a mean dose of 40 Gy to the parotid gland resulted in a 50% chance of a complication. The improvements in the radiotherapy treatment of head-and-neck cancer patients described in this thesis will make an important difference in preventing radiation-induced xerostomia and improve the quality of life of these patients. This will reduce the occurrence of submandibular gland complications from the 80% we see nowadays to 50% or less'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The studies conducted in this thesis explored brain structures in first-degree relatives of patients with schizophrenia. The meta-analysis that Boos and colleagues performed showed that relatives of patients with schizophrenia had smaller hippocampal volumes, smaller gray matter volumes and larger third ventricle volumes compared to controls. These volumetric differences are similar to the areas that are affected in patients with schizophrenia and parallel findings of neuropsychological impairments. Boos suggested that this finding may reflect a vulnerability to develop schizophrenia but that it is still unclear how and to what extent genetic and/or environmental influences are involved. In a large cross-sectional MRI study Boos and colleagues examined brain structures in patients with schizophrenia, their non-psychotic siblings and controls, using global and focal brain measurements. Global brain volumes of non-psychotic siblings were not different from those of controls, nor did siblings differ in cortical thickness or gray matter density, using a voxel-based morphometry approach. Their findings were consistent with those from another large sibling sample, but contrast with those of smaller imaging studies. Boos suggested that the structural brain abnormalities observed in patients are (for the largest part) explained by disease-related factors. Boos further examined mean fractional anisotropy (FA) in multiple white matter tracts in patients with schizophrenia, their non-psychotic siblings and controls using tract-based analysis. This was the first tract-based study in siblings of patients with schizophrenia. Mean FA was higher in the left and right arcuate fasciculus for siblings compared to patients and controls, but no differences were found in mean FA for other WM tracts. They suggested that an increased familial risk for schizophrenia may be associated with higher FA for the arcuate fasciculus bilaterally. They found a decrease in FA with increasing age in patients compared to siblings and controls, suggesting a possible progressive loss of WM microstructure over time in schizophrenia. In their final study, Boos and colleagues examined brain structures in both the healthy parents of patients with schizophrenia compared to control couples, in relation to cognitive function. The association between brain measures and cognitive measures of psychomotor function, verbal memory and IQ were investigated. Parents of patients showed smaller total brain volumes as compared to control couples, but no differences were found for other global volumes or gray matter density. In the total sample, total brain volume was associated with faster performance on the motor task. The findings in the parents of patients mirror (to a lesser extent) the decrease of brain volume that has consistently been reported in patients with this illness. Together, the studies of Boos and colleagues show that indeed there are structural brain abnormalities in the first-degree relatives of patients with schizophrenia. However, using multiple brain imaging measurements, Boos and colleagues have not found brain differences in the non-psychotic siblings compared to healthy controls. There is evidence that genes play an important role in the development of schizophrenia and that siblings of patients with schizophrenia are at high risk to developing this illness. However, Boos and colleagues do not clearly suggest that structural brain abnormalities are present in this group at risk for schizophrenia. It remains to be elucidated to what extent genetic and/or environmental influences are involved in the cause of brain abnormalities in schizophrenia'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The research described in this thesis evaluated the effect of vitamin E supplementation under field conditions on the udder health of Dutch dairy cows. Additionally, it investigated the mechanism by which vitamin E influenced oxidative stress, especially during the dry period. Moreover, it investigated whether fat metabolism during the dry period influenced oxidative stress. The main finding presented in this thesis is the adverse effect of vitamin E supplementation on udder health in early lactation; both subclinical and clinical mastitis incidences were significantly higher in dairy cows that received a daily supplement of 3,000 IU/cow/day during the dry period compared to cows that received 135 IU. This appears to be the first time that an adverse effect of vitamin E was found in dairy cows. It was both a completely unexpected outcome, and one that highlights the importance of awareness of possible adverse effects of vitamin E. The adverse effect of vitamin E might be explained by the fact that high levels of vitamin E can, under some conditions, increase oxidative stress. High levels of oxidative stress are, in turn related to a higher risk of clinical mastitis. Thus, for some of the cows in this study, oxidative stress from high amounts of vitamin E during the dry period resulted in more mastitis. Therefore, vitamin E supplements are, for some dry dairy cows, not needed. Moreover based on all the results gathered on oxidative stress, it can be concluded that gaining insight into the mechanism by which vitamin E influences oxidative stress is quite difficult. Even in well-controlled experiments, no general effect of vitamin E supplementation was observed. In addition, while it seems that blood levels of vitamin E and the ratio of vitamin E to cholesterol are very reliable, it still remains difficult to define an oxidative status of the cow only based on blood levels of different oxidative stress related parameters. Because the clinical trial showed an adverse effect of vitamin E, it remains complicated to evaluate whether the assumed link between vitamin E supplementation and (udder) health improvement is through reduced oxidative stress is correct'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) or Rendu-Osler-Weber (ROW) syndrome is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by vascular malformations in multiple organ systems. HHT has an age-related penetrance and variable clinical expression. The clinical symptoms are caused by direct arteriovenous connections without an intervening capillary bed. This can result in a range of manifestations, from smaller mucocutaneous telangiectases to large visceral arteriovenous malformations (AVM). The clinical manifestations of HHT include recurrent epistaxis, multiple telangiectases, at characteristic sites (lips, oral cavity, nose, fingers, gastrointestinal telangiectases) and AVMs, mostly in the lung (PAVM), the liver (HAVM) or the brain (CAVM). The clinical diagnosis HHT is established using the Cura硯 criteria. At least three of the following four criteria are required for a certain clinical diagnosis: spontaneous and recurrent epistaxis, telangiectases at characteristic sites, visceral manifestations (gastrointestinal telangiectases, PAVM, CAVM, HAVM) and a first degree relative with HHT. In the presence of two criteria, the diagnosis is considered possible. Mutations in the endoglin (ENG) and activin A receptor type-like kinase 1 (ACVRL1) genes have been shown to be associated with HHT; mutations in ENG cause HHT1 and mutations in ACVRL1 cause HHT2. A combined syndrome of juvenile polyposis and HHT is caused by mutations in the SMAD4 gene. The molecular and genetic characterization of HHT families is performed. Once a mutation in the majority of the families is found, the identification of carriers and non-carriers is possible and the HHT subtype is clear. This combined with well described phenotypes, allows for an extensive analysis of the genotype-phenotype correlation, which is performed. Analyses are performed to establish the phenotypic differences between HHT1 and HHT2 for the AVMs, telangiectases, episaxis and gastrointestinal telangiectases. The results published in this thesis have improved the knowledge of HHT. In families suspected of HHT, a general risk profile for the different clinical manifestations can be given to probands and family members according to the type of HHT. However, the risk profile of the clinical manifestations remains population based. An explanation for the question, why the one family member is affected with all symptoms whereas the other has only epistaxis, remains open and will be focus of future research. Identifying modifier genes or environmental factors influencing the expression of the HHT genes will possibly generate a more personalized risk profile'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Paediatric lung function tests provide objective measures in diagnosis and follow-up of lung diseases, and give insight in the pathophysiology of lung growth and development. In the first part of the thesis, paediatric lung function tests were used to investigate determinants of lung growth and development. The implementation of smoke free legislation resulted in less pregnant women being exposed to environmental tobacco smoke, and a concomitant rise in birth weight and birth-weight-adjusted neonatal lung function. Prenatal tobacco smoke exposure resulted in reduced neonatal lung function in healthy newborns, but this did not persist into childhood when there was no postnatal smoke exposure. Parental smoking during childhood resulted in diminished airway function in healthy children, with the most marked decrease in peripheral airway function. Furthermore, in healthy newborns parental lung function was found to be a determinant of neonatal lung function. Additionally, children with accelerated weight gain during the first 3 months of life had more wheezing complaints in early childhood and decreased lung function at the age of five. The second part of the thesis focussed on the use of paediatric lung function testing and reference values in clinical practice. New reference values for paediatric lung function tests were generated. They provide a more valid estimation of a patient’s lung function and result in less over- and underdiagnosis of pulmonary diseases. Measurement of interrupter resistance was found not to be an alternative for forced expiratory volume measurements to diagnose bronchial hyperresponsiveness in individual patients. An exhalation time of six seconds during exhaled Nitric Oxide measurements showed good agreement with the standard exhalation time of 10 seconds and was favoured by young children'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The human body is continuously at battle with bacterial pathogens from its surrounding environment. This leads to a strong selective pressure on both the pathogen and the host. Accordingly, humans and bacteria have evolved elaborate measures to fight one another. In humans the complement system forms the first line of defense against invading bacteria. These trigger the activation of the complement system. This leads to various effector functions one of which entails the formation of large lytic pores on the bacterial membrane, thereby directly killing Gram-negative bacteria. These pores are called the membrane attack complex MAC) and their formation is mediated by a group of proteins collectively referred to as the MACPF family which act in concert to drill a hole through the membrane of target cells. We have determined crystal structures of two components of the MAC, the complex between C5b and C6 and the MACPF domain of C8a?. These structures yielded the unexpected result that the MACPF domain resembles cholesterol dependent cytolysins (CDCs), a group of well studied bacterial pore-forming toxins. These structure show for the first time how formation of the MAC is initiated and allow us to construct a model for how the proteins of the MAC go from a water soluble state in the blood to a membrane inserted pore on the surface of bacterial targets. Like CDCs, MACPF domains contain two amphipathic segments folded against the protein. Upon activation these segments can unfold to form extended ?-hairpins that ultimately form the lining of a large ?-barrel pore. The structures have greatly expanded our understanding of how the proteins of the MAC function together to form a bactericidal pore but also form a starting point of biochemical studies that will increase our understanding even further. A second key component humans use to fight of infections is phagocytosis. In this process, white blood cells like neutrophils, recognize antibodies bound to e.g. bacteria through so called Fc? receptors. Staphylococcus aureas, a Gram-positive bacteria that is well known for its numerous immune evasion strategies, has evolved a protein, FLIPr and its homologue, FLIPr-like, that are able to bind to the Fc? receptor most important for phagocytosis by neutrophils, Fc?RIIa This binding inhibits phagocytosis thereby conferring a strong advantage for invading bacteria. We have solved the crystal structure of the complex between FLIPr-like and Fc?RIIa and characterized the binding of the proteins with isothermal calorimetry. The structure give a clear picture of how FLIPr-like inhibits antibody binding to the receptor as their binding sites almost fully overlap. Furthermore, the structure also gives insight into the specificity FLIPr-like has for the different isoforms of Fc? receptors. Collectively the data could aid in the design of novel receptor isoform specific inhibitors to aid in the treatment of auto-immune diseases and inflammatory disorders.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Back pain is common in both dogs and humans, and is often associated with intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration. The IVDs are essential structures of the spine and degeneration can ultimately result in diseases such as IVD herniation or spinal instability. In order to design new treatments halting or even preventing IVD degeneration, more basic knowledge of the disease process is needed. The aim of this thesis was to increase the knowledge of IVD degeneration in dogs and to evaluate the similarities and differences between IVD degeneration in dogs and humans, in order to establish whether spontaneous IVD degeneration occurring in both chondrodystrophic (CD) and non-chondrodystrophic (NCD) dog breeds can be used as translational animal models for human spine research. The key findings of the thesis are: • The division of the processes underlying canine IVD degeneration into chondroid or fibroid degeneration appears to be inaccurate. The biochemical, histopathological, and morphological alterations examined during the process of IVD degeneration were found to be similar in CD and NCD dog breeds. • IVD degenerative diseases were most common in CD breeds, especially in Dachshunds, and were 1.5 times more common in male than female dogs. Case fatality rates were found to be higher than previously suggested, with rates of 34% in the overall population, around 20% in most CD breeds, and over 50% in the NCD breeds at highest risk such as the Doberman and the German Shepherd Dog. • IVD degeneration in dogs could accurately be diagnosed, early in the degenerative process, by using low-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The MRI based grading scheme used in humans could reliably be used in dogs, and was found to be highly correlated with pathological changes found post mortem. Early diagnosis facilitates the possibility of preemptive treatments. • A new nucleus pulposus prosthesis, made of an intrinsically radiopaque hydrogel, was tested ex-vivo in dogs. Surgical implantation of the prosthesis in canine lumbosacral IVDs via a dorsal laminectomy was clinically applicable. After absorbing fluid from the surrounding tissue the swollen implant could restore disc height, which could be monitored by radiography, computed tomography and MRI. • Many similarities were found between the processes of IVD degeneration in humans and CD and NCD dog breeds. Both dog-types may serve as translational animal models of spontaneous IVD degeneration for human research. Synergistic effects of studying IVD degeneration in veterinary patients could lead to new treatment modalities for both dogs and humans, a reduced need for animal testing, and lower cost of research. It is also likely that spontaneous IVD degeneration in dogs more resembles the true disease process, as it occurs in humans, than induced IVD degeneration in experimental animals.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Human and bovine RSVs cause severe disease in humans and in cattle respectively. They have been recognised as important respiratory pathogens in the last five decades, and this has resulted in significant research activities on the pathogenesis and intervention strategies around the world. Physicians and veterinarians have been puzzled by conflicting results from field and experimental observations: for example which mechanism are involved in the development of disease signs and symptoms,; how to diagnose and treat the disease; what is the effect of vaccination with different vaccine candidates, and how to develop other intervention strategies for RSV infections?. The most intriguing observations occurred in the 1960s, when the first hRSV vaccines were evaluated in children under field conditions. The vaccine-enhanced RSV disease has triggered many studies about the possible mechanisms involved, however without delivering a final answer to this question so far. Despite many years of considerable research efforts there are still no effective hRSV vaccines available. For bRSV vaccines that are available on the market, there is still a need for more knowledge regarding efficacy and safety. Essentially two types of animal models can be distinguished: heterologous (so called surrogate) models in which non-natural hosts are used, and homologous (so called natural-host models) infection models. Surrogate RSV models, most commonly using mice and cotton rats, have extensively been used for hRSV research. Unfortunately these animals are semi-permissive for viral replication and do not exhibit hRSV disease as observed in naturally infected children. On the other hand, these laboratory animal models offer the advantage of working in a well defined genetic background, are easy to handle, relatively cheap, can be used more easily with statistically relevant numbers, and can allow all appropriate controls [1]. An other advantage of using mouse models is that many immunological reagents are available, in contrast to cotton rats, for which much less immunological reagents are available. Our homologous challenge model for bRSV in cattle, in which severe disease is observed upon aerosol infection, and vaccination-enhanced disease can be reproduced 4-6 months after vaccination with inactivated and adjuvanted vaccine by challenge-infection, appears instrumental in better understanding the mechanisms underlying disease augmentation. In particular, it has become clear that serological data alone are inadequate or at least insufficient to evaluate safety or potency of vaccines and the data presented in this thesis suggest that a combination of serological, cellular and immunological parameters must be measured in a suitable animal model and preferably in field studies. In this way the potential and limitations of bRSV vaccine candidates may be better assessed in the field. Our studies therefore have added major tools to the field of safety and efficacy evaluation of bRSV vaccines. The higher predictive value of a homologous animal model in natural host species may also provide important insights and tools that can be used in hRSV vaccine development'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Colorectal cancer remains one of the most common malignancies worldwide. As liver metastases are found in approximately 50% of patients with colorectal cancer, colorectal liver metastases (CLM) concern a major health issue. Hepatic resection is the only treatment option providing long-term survival for patients with CLM, with 5-year survival rates up to 67% in highly selected patients. However, when using traditional criteria, hepatic resection can only be offered to 10-20% of patients presenting with CLM. To increase the number of patients amenable for surgery, several strategies have been developed, including the use of modern chemotherapy regimens which downsize CLM to allow surgery, portal vein embolization which stimulates growth of liver tissue, two-stage hepatectomy, vascular resection and reconstruction, and in situ hypothermic liver perfusion. Taken together, the modern treatment of CLM should be multidisciplinary, necessitating a close collaboration between surgeons and oncologists, with frequent re-evaluations and adequate timing to optimize therapeutic strategies on an individual basis. The central theme of this thesis is the multidisciplinary treatment of CLM, with special emphasis on factors which determine outcome following hepatic resection and the place of surgery in patients with both CLM and extrahepatic disease. The research described in this thesis shows that an aggressive multidisciplinary treatment approach, consisting of perioperative chemotherapy en (repeat) surgery, can result in significant long-term outcome in patients with CLM. Also, well-selected patients with both CLM and extrahepatic disease can undergo surgical resection with reasonable expectations of long-term survival. However, these patients should be treated in specialized hepatobiliary centers, offering them a multidisciplinary treatment approach, as this is the only chance of long-term survival and even cure'],\n",

The disease is distributed world-wide and may cause large economic losses in the poultry industry. The severity of the disease varies depending on the host species and specific properties of the virus. Highly virulent strains of NDV can be discriminated from low virulent strains by the presence of a multibasic amino acid motif at the proteolytic cleavage site of the fusion (F) protein. However, some NDV variants isolated from pigeons (pigeon paramyxovirus type 1; PPMV-1) are low virulent for chickens, despite their F protein cleavage site containing a multibasic amino acid sequence. Furthermore, these isolates may show an increase in virulence when passaged in chickens. To study the molecular basis of NDV virulence, a reverse genetics system for the non-virulent PPMV-1 strain AV324 was developed. Furthermore, the already available reverse genetics system for the highly virulent NDV strain Herts/33 was used. Subsequently, the NP, P, M, F and L genes were evaluated for their role in virulence by exchanging these genes between both strains. The results showed that the F protein of AV324 is functionally not different from that of Herts/33. However, a direct correlation between the activity of the viral replication proteins (NP, P and L) and virulence was demonstrated. To elucidate the adaptation mechanism by which PPMV-1 becomes more virulent for chickens, strain AV324 was passaged five times in day-old chickens. Complete genome sequencing of passaged virus showed that the increase in virulence was accompanied by mutations in the L and P replication proteins rather than the viral fusion protein. The effect of these mutations on virulence and enhanced replication was confirmed by means of reverse genetics. All together, these results demonstrate that the virulence level of NDV is directly related to the efficiency of viral replication. These data, together with the knowledge that some PPMV-1 infected pigeons shed virus without having clinical signs and the observation that the number of NDV outbreaks in pigeons caused by PPMV-1 in Europe is increasing, underlines the potential danger of pigeon-derived paramyxoviruses for the poultry industry.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Pluripotent stem cells have the ability to give rise to derivatives of all the germ layers and hold therefore great promise for future applications like cell replacement therapies and drug screenings, for example. Pluripotent stem cells can be expanded indefinitely which leads to an almost unlimited source of cells. These unique characteristics allow for the biochemical study of developmental processes in vitro that are not feasible in vivo due to restricted cell numbers within one embryo. The recent derivation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) from somatic cells unlocked a second source for pluripotent stem cells and fueled the hope for treatment of numerous diseases. But a comprehensive understanding of pluripotency per se is necessary to fully exploit the possibilities of these patient specific pluripotent stem cells while limiting the accompanying risks. This thesis focuses on different aspects of pluripotency in mouse and human pluripotent stem cells. The use of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) recombineering is a common practice to generate transgenic reporter cell lines that faithfully recapitulate the tissue specific expression profile of the gene of interest. We describe here the development of an efficient system for the generation of BAC-based targeting constructs. This system allows for the quick and straightforward generation of a BAC targeting vector and subsequent derivation of recombined BACs to that allows for the manipulation of the mammalian genome. This second part of this thesis concentrates on different aspects of the pluripotent stem cell state. Murine and human pluripotent stem cells show vast differences regarding their colony morphology, growth factor dependency and molecular characteristics and are therefore considered being in two different pluripotent stem cell states: naïve and primed pluripotency respectively. We set out to analyze the influence of the growth factor environment on the outcome of the reprogramming event. We first focused on permissive mouse strains and showed that murine iPS cells from the B6/129 hyrbid strain derived under bFGF and ActivinA signaling are more similar to regular naïve pluripotent stem cells then to primed pluripotent stem cells or EpiSCs. In a second set of experiments we analyzed the opposite scenario: the derivation of human pluripotent stem cells under naïve pluripotent conditions. We used induction of pluripotency and showed that cells can be derived with characteristics of naïve pluripotent stem cells regarding their morphology, growth characteristics and growth factor environment. These cells can facilitate homologous recombination and therefore allow the generation of transgenic human cell lines. The cell are not pluripotent but can be converted into primed pluripotent stem cells via an easy growth factor switch thereby allowing the derivation of transgenic hES like cells from patient derived somatic cells.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['195 patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) who had no history of smoking tobacco or drinking alcohol are described. The data is retrieved from the database at the University Medical Center Utrecht which contains information on patient characteristics, risk factors, and tumor classification, including data on development of recurrences, second primary tumors and follow up. During the period 1980-2003, 4404 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the lip, oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx and larynx were registered. The clinicopathological characteristics of 195 (4.4%) non-smoking and non-drinking patients were analyzed and compared with data for all Dutch patients with HNSCC obtained from the Netherlands Cancer Registry. Non-smoking and non-drinking patients with HNSCC had distinct characteristics. They were typically female, had advanced age at disease presentation and had tumors mainly of the oral cavity. The incidence of second primary tumors (SPTs) was high, mainly occurring in the oral cavity. The prognostic relevance of tobacco and alcohol for patients with HNSCC was addressed. To this end, univariate and multivariate survival analysis were performed for 2012 patients, including 183 non-smoking and non-drinking patients and 1829 patients who consumed both tobacco and alcohol. HNSCC-specific survival was not significantly different for patients who smoked and drank and those who did not. Overall survival was significantly affected by tobacco and alcohol. The expression of tumor suppressor gene p53 and proliferation marker Ki-67 in non-tumorous (tumor-adjacent) mucosal epithelial cells were analyzed to study whether biomarker expression is associated with a history of smoking and drinking and with single and multiple HNSCC. Non-smoking and non-drinking patients with multiple and single tumors, smoking and drinking patients with multiple and single tumors were selected. p53 expression was significantly higher in users of tobacco and alcohol than in non-users. Ki-67 expression was not affected by tobacco and alcohol use. Both Ki-67 and p53 were similarly expressed in the groups with single and multiple tumors and thus not significantly related to the number of tumors. Hence, the significance of these proteins as biomarkers indicating premalignant mucosal alterations in HNSCC was considered as doubtful. A case-case analysis was performed to compare presence of Human papilloma virus (HPV) in tumor cells of 16 non-smoking and non-drinking with 16 matched smoking and drinking patients with oropharyngeal localized tumors. Non-smoking and non-drinking patients had more HPV-positive tumors than smoking and drinking patients. Overall survival and disease-specific survival were better for HPV-positive compared to HPV-negative cases. DNA microarray detected 49 differentially expressed genes for non-smoking and non-drinking patients compared to smoking and drinking patients. Amongst others, 7 genes related to Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) \\uf020were downregulated. These genes play an important role in controlling the immune response upon pathogenic challenge. Moreover, 2 genes linked to NFKB pathway, which is a key regulator in TRD/TRAIL-mediated apoptosis were upregulated. Our findings suggest that the non-smoking and non-drinking patients with HNSCC have a different immune response to their tumor when compared to their smoking and drinking counterparts which may reflect a different underlying carcinogenetic mechanism.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['The Severe Cardiorenal Syndrome'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['In this thesis we investigated the interactions between heart and kidneys in disease in a longitudinal and integrative fashion. We developed two different rat models of the Severe Cardiorenal Syndrome and studied the effects of different interventions on progression of cardiorenal failure and on structural and functional outcome. In Part I we propose the Cardiorenal Connection (CRC) as a pathophysiological model in which the cardiorenal connectors interact and synergize to cause accelerated cardiovascular damage in the SCRS. The connectors are: (1) an imbalance between nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), (2) activation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) (3) activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), and (4) induction of inflammation. In Part II we describe the development of a model of combined chronic kidney disease (CKD) and heart failure (HF), and found evidence of bi-directional organ damage and the effect of interventions targeted at the CRC. We found that pre-existent CKD aggravated cardiac dilatation after MI that was associated with worsened cardiac diastolic and systolic function, and mortality. Conversely, the ensuing HF exacerbated glomerular damage in CKD rats, which was not associated with worsening of creatinine clearance or proteinuria. Blockade of all cardiorenal connectors with angiotensin receptor blockade and beta-blockade, systemic supplementation of NO, and anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory therapy had significant beneficial effects on cardiorenal outcome: cardiac systolic function was preserved, glomerular damage was ameliorated, and tubulointerstitial damage was almost completely reversed. Blockade of 3 or 1 cardiorenal connectors resulted in a similar upholding of systolic function but had less effect on renal injury. We further described increased cardiac hepcidin expression in rats with SNX or CL, as well as in the combination. In contrast, liver hepcidin expression was not affected by both single insults but down-regulated in combined SNX and CL. Part III describes investigations into the role of nitric oxide (NO) in cardiac dysfunction in CKD. Low dose NO synthase (NOS) inhibition during CKD induced worsened proteinuria, severe cardiac dysfunction and reduced systemic NO production as compared to rats with CKD alone and controls treated with a similar dose of NOS inhibition. Furthermore, the increased protein excretion, the cardiac dysfunction and the low NO production after cessation of NOS inhibition. The mild hemodynamic effects of low dose NOS inhibition observed in controls were fully reversible. The findings of the previous study strongly suggested a causal link between NO availability and cardiac function. We investigated the effect of systemic NO supplementation with the tolerance-free NO donor molsidomine (MOLS) as a rescue therapy. MOLS significantly improved diastolic and systolic heart function, with mild effects on cardiac loading conditions and LVH, and no effects on cardiac fibrosis. Creatinine clearance and tubulo-interstitial injury improved, but no effect was seen on proteinuria. Expression of nNOS was increased compared to controls in this model of the SCRS. We assessed the effect of selective nNOS blockade in baseline and under beta-adrenergic stimulation and found that nNOS derived NO supports diastolic relaxation in CRS rats, but does not modulate the impaired beta-adrenergic response'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Death receptors and colorectal liver metastases'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Death receptors are a unique class of cell-surface receptors which are best known for their ability to induce apoptosis upon binding their respective ligands. Among the best studied death receptors are CD95 and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptors. Apoptosis has long been thought to be the primary outcome of death receptor activation and this has lead to the development of death receptor-stimulating agents as anti-tumor therapeutics. However, more recent data suggest that CD95 and TRAIL receptors can also act in a pro-tumorigenic fashion by stimulating tumor cell proliferation, survival and invasion. Identification of the factors and molecular mechanisms that determine these various outcomes in death receptor signaling may lead to new therapeutic strategies targeting death receptors in (surgical) cancer therapy. Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) poses a serious threat to public health as it is one of the most common malignancies in the Western world with over one million new cases each year. The KRAS oncogene is one of the most frequently mutated oncogenes in human cancer with a prevalence of approximately 35-45% in colorectal cancer. It is known that a mutation in the KRAS oncogene contributes to the formation of colorectal tumors, however the role of KRAS in metastasis formation is less known. The presence of liver metastases is the major determinant of survival in patients with colorectal cancer. Approximately 25% of the patients with colorectal cancer already have liver metastases at diagnosis. Only a subgroup of patients with these synchronous colorectal liver metastases benefits from liver surgery. Currently, there are no reliable tools to identify such patients. This thesis describes the role of death receptors in the development and outgrowth of colorectal liver metastases. The key findings in this thesis are that (1) death receptors can be switched into metastasis-promoting receptors by the single common oncogene K-Ras and this is important for survival of metastatic tumor cells and their outgrowth in the liver. An immediate implication of the finding that oncogenic K-Ras alters CD95 signaling output is that therapeutic targeting of death receptors by CD95/TRAIL could have adverse effects on disease progression by promoting invasion and dissemination of micrometastases instead of clearing them. This is a major concern, at least when considering such compounds in the treatment of tumors harboring activating mutations in the K-Ras gene. In addition, (2) CD95 plays an important role in surgery-stimulated outgrowth of colorectal micrometastases in the liver. Therapy antagonizing death receptor signaling could therefore be of interest in the reduction of accelerated outgrowth. Furthermore, (3) preliminary results indicate that circulating CD95L might be usefull as a prognostic factor contributing to the selection of patients for liver surgery'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Fluoropyrimidines, including 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and its oral prodrugs capecitabine and tegafur, are among the most commonly prescribed anticancer drugs for the adjuvant and palliative treatment of various types of solid malignancies, including colorectal cancer, gastric cancer and breast cancer. The major lines of research described in this thesis focus on the treatment optimization of fluoropyrimidine therapy, in terms of both safety and efficacy. The studies include clinical pharmacogenetic, pharmacokinetic, and phase I-II trials with fluoropyrimidines. In 568 patients with advanced colorectal cancer treated with capecitabine-based chemotherapy the effect of genetic polymorphism within the primary fluoropyrimidine inactivating enzyme dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase was investigated. Five polymorphism were predictive for development of grade ? 3 diarrhea, of which the clinically most relevant polymorphism was DPYD*2A. All patients polymorphic for DPYD*2A experienced any type of severe toxicity of treatment, which was lethal in one patient. In a prospective study, patients intended to undergo treatment with capecitabine or 5-FU were prospectively screened for presence of the DPYD*2A polymorphism prior to start of therapy. Polymorphic patients were treated with an initially ? 50% reduced fluoropyrimidine dose during the first two cycles, which was further dose-titrated based on clinical tolerability. Toxicity by genotype-guided dosing was compared to toxicity in historical DPYD*2A controls having received full dose treatment (n=40 variant allele carriers obtained from 9 cohort studies including a total of 3391 patients). A total number of 1600 patients was prospectively genotyped prior to start of therapy, of which 17 were heterozygously polymorphic for DPYD*2A. With a median fluoropyrimidine dose intensity of 48% (range 24-91%) per cycle, the DPYD*2A patients could be safely treated. Thereby, the risk of grade ? 3 toxicity reduced from 70% in historical controls to 15% by genotype-guided dosing. Drug-induced death reduced from 10% to 0%. In addition, upfront genotyping proved to be cost-effective. In another study the effect of gastric surgery on the systemic exposure to capecitabine was investigated in patients with gastric cancer. A total and partial gastrectomy resulted in a faster absorption, a higher maximum concentration, and a higher total systemic exposure of capecitabine compared to patients with an intact stomach. Three phase I-II trials were conducted: one investigated the combination of docetaxel, oxaliplatin and capecitabine in 33 patients with advanced gastric cancer. The overall response rate was 46% including two complete responses. Median progression-free and overall survival were 6.9 and 11.6 months. Febrile neutropenia occurred in 14% of the patients. A second phase I-II trial was performed in 18 patients with anal cancer treated with simultaneous-integrated boost radiation therapy (33x1.8/1.5 Gy 3x1.8 Gy boost) with concomitant capecitabine and mitomycin-C on day 1. Predominant grade ? 3 toxicities included dermatitis within the radiation area (61%), fatigue (22%) and pain (6%). 72% of the patients achieved a complete response. A third phase I-II trial investigated the combination of everolimus with capecitabine in patients with advanced solid malignancies. 18 patients were recruited, the recommended dose was everolimus 10 mg/day continuously plus capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 bid for 14 days in three-weekly cycles. Toxicities remained mostly grade ? 2.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Most anticancer chemotherapeutic drugs are given intravenously. However, there is a growing interest in developing anticancer drugs for oral application. Different classes of anticancer drugs are already orally available and widely applied such as the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (imatinib, erlotinib, gefitinib, sorafenib and sunitinib), alkylating agents (temozolamide and cyclophosphamide) and the 5FU prodrug, capecitabine, a drug for which the intravenous-to-oral switch has already been successfully implemented in clinical practice. One of the aims of this thesis was to investigate the oral application of docetaxel. Docetaxel has a low bioavailability due to affinity for drug transporters, especially ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein, P-gp), extensive first pass metabolism by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and poor drug solubility. In previous studies it has been demonstrated that the low systemic exposure to docetaxel is primarily determined by CYP3A4 in gut and liver. Inhibition of CYP3A4 in mice using low-dose ritonavir was found to increase the systemic exposure in mice by 50-fold. In patients the apparent bioavailability of docetaxel increased to more than 100% after co-administration of ritonavir. The studies described in this thesis investigated the pharmacology of orally administered docetaxel more thoroughly in order to determine the optimal boosted oral docetaxel regimen. We demonstrated that the concept of boosting docetaxel is possible with any strong CYP3A4 inhibitor. We selected low-dose ritonavir for the further development of boosted orally administered docetaxel, since ritonavir resulted in high systemic exposure to docetaxel, had a good safety profile and since ritonavir is used as booster as standard practice in multiple anti-HIV regimens. Most studies described in this thesis were conducted with a novel solid docetaxel formulation, ModraDoc001 capsules. To improve the poor aqueous solubility, a solid dispersion formulation of docetaxel has been designed by the pharmacy of the Slotervaart Hospital. This formulation was investigated in 55 patients and resulted in high systemic exposure to docetaxel. The variability was modest and of the same order as after intravenous administration of docetaxel. This is an important finding since high variability may lead to unexpected severe toxicity or under-dosing. The safety of weekly oral docetaxel in combination with ritonavir was determined in a dose escalation study. The most observed adverse event was diarrhea with an overall incidence of 66%. Major treatment limiting adverse effects observed after intravenous therapy with docetaxel, e.g. fluid retention, hematological toxicity and infusion reactions were not observed. Consequently, high doses of dexamethason to prevent fluid retention and allergic reactions were not required. Furthermore, the anti-tumor activity observed at the two highest dose-levels strengthens the concept that oral administration of docetaxel is feasible and potentially active. Concluding, the oral application of the taxanes docetaxel and paclitaxel was found to be feasible. The presented pharmacokinetic data demonstrated that the systemic exposure to the taxanes was high and signs of antitumor activity were observed after treatment with ritonavir boosted ModraDoc001 capsules. Plans for phase II clinical testing of ritonavir boosted ModraDoc001 are made for maintenance or second line treatment of patients with non-small-cell-lung-cancer'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has changed significantly in the past decades with regard to the use of treatment strategies as well as to set the aim of treatment. Research evaluated strategies to reach the aim of remission or low disease activity instead of clinically relevant improvement. These strategies can be grouped as ‘tight control’, which is evaluated in this thesis. Tight control can be defined as a treatment strategy with dose and strategy adjustments tailored to the disease activity of each individual RA patient aimed at a predefined level (i.e. ‘treat to target’) of low disease activity or preferably remission within a reasonable period of time. In the thesis aspects of tight control are described, including effectiveness, adverse effects, and long-term outcome, while also research into possible predictors of RA to prevent under- and overtreatment of the individual RA patient is described. This thesis shows that tight control is effective, especially in case of adding low-dose prednisone to a methotrexate (MTX) based tight control strategy (i.e. CAMERA-II trial). Within the tight control strategies relatively mild adverse events were observed; weighing efficacy and toxicity of the strategy, efficacy clearly outweighs toxicity. Tight control can be obtained with several different treatment strategies. When a patient does not sufficiently response to (oral) MTX treatment as next treatment strategy step, switching from oral to subcutaneous MTX seems to be effective, in contrast to adding cyclosporine to MTX. Also, it is important to decide at which moment early in the treatment of RA, medication should be added to the strategy. This decision can be based upon the response to treatment after 6 months after start of treatment, and possibly even earlier. Tight control as treatment strategy probably needs to be continued also for a prolonged period of time, especially for RA patients with moderate to high disease activity. To treat to target, assessment of this target, e.g. remission should be validated. This thesis shows that the use of DAS28 (a disease activity score not including the feet) as a monitoring instrument for the individual patient is not always straightforward. Also the presence of tender points influences disease activity state as calculated by the DAS28 and therefore use of this index for tight control can lead to undertreatment of RA patients. Disease activity states as assessed with these indices should be interpreted with caution, especially low or remission disease activity states. For an optimal choice regarding tight control strategies good predictors are needed to predict the outcome of each individual RA patient. Prediction of the most optimal individual dose of MTX with clinical variables and prediction of disease activity and radiographic outcome with biomarkers was explored within the thesis, but these preliminary results needs to be further evaluated'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Breast cancer is one of the most common malignant diseases. Adjuvant systemic therapies such as chemotherapy, immunotherapy and endocrine therapy play an important role in the treatment of breast cancer. These therapies reduce the risk of relapse of breast cancer and increase cure rates. However, these therapies are associated with short- and long-term side-effects. Sometimes these side-effects are irreversible and disabling, which may affect the quality of life, treatment continuation and treatment adherence. The research described in this thesis is focused on treatment of anti-cancer therapy induced menopausal symptoms and on trastuzumab-related cardiac dysfunction in women with early and advanced breast cancer. The aim was to investigate new treatment options for the management of hot flashes, and new modalities for the detection and prevention of trastuzumab-related cardiotoxicity. Results of a prospective randomized double blind three-armed trial comparing clonidine, venlafaxine and placebo in the management of hot flashes in women with a history of breast cancer are described. Venlafaxine treatment resulted in a more immediate reduction of hot-flash scores when compared with clonidine, however hot-flash scores at week 12 were lower in the clonidine group than in the venlafaxine group. The main conclusion of this study was that both drugs reduced the hot-flash scores in women after a diagnosis of breast cancer. However, since venlafaxine showed a better reduction of hot flashes score over the whole treatment period of 12 weeks, venlafaxine might be the preferred treatment. Several studies into the cardiac safety of trastuzumab treatment are described in this thesis. Trastuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against the extracellular domain of HER2 and treatment with trastuzumab has resulted in clinical benefit in HER2 positive advanced breast cancer and improved disease-free and overall survival in combination with adjuvant chemotherapy in HER2 positive primary breast cancer. Overall trastuzumab treatment is well tolerated, however cardiac dysfunction is one of the clinically relevant side-effects of trastuzumab treatment manifested by left ventricular systolic dysfunction and in a small proportion of patients even in advanced congestive heart failure. Only prior or concomitant treatment with anthracyclines was identified as a significant predictive factor of cardiac dysfunction. However, no statistically significantly association was seen between potential risk factors for the development of cardiotoxicity, such as age, high body mass index and use of antihypertensive drug or co-morbidity and the incidence of cardiac events. Serum biomarkers such as NT-proBNP and the troponines were not statistically significantly related to trastuzumab-associated cardiotoxicity or recovery. Trastuzumab induced cardiac toxicity was partly reversible also in patients with a decreased left ventricular function prior to treatment with trastuzumab. The development of a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) model is described. This PK-PD model can be used to address clinical questions regarding optimal management of trastuzumab-associated cardiotoxicity and to develop monitoring strategies. The tentative blinded results of a prospective, placebo-controlled, pharmacological intervention study (CANDY) are described. In this study, patients were treated concurrently with adjuvant trastuzumab and an angiotensin II-receptor blocker (candesartan) for HER2 positive breast cancer. Currently, the effect of candesartan in the prevention of trastuzumab-associated cardiotoxicity can not be disclosed. In conclusion, longer follow-up studies in large patient populations are needed to evaluate long-term tolerability and cardiac safety of trastuzumab treatment. Unblinding and final results of the CANDY study are needed to evaluate the effect of candesartan in the prevention of trastuzumab-associated cardiotoxicity in early breast cancer patients.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Immunogenicity of recombinant interferon beta aggregates : mechanistic studies in transgenic immune tolerant mice'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Therapeutic proteins have become an important class of drugs. One of those proteins currently on the market is recombinant human interferon beta (rhIFN?), used to treat multiple sclerosis. After prolonged treatment, a substantial proportion of patients form antibodies against the protein. The immunological response generally starts with the appearance of binding antibodies possibly affecting the clearance of the drug, followed by neutralizing antibodies that block the biological activity of the protein. Such immune response is not expected, since human proteins are in principle tolerated by the human immune system. Several factors contribute to immunogenicity but protein aggregates are believed to play a major role. To study the relation between protein structure and immunogenicity, transgenic animal models immune tolerant for the protein were developed. This thesis aimed at providing mechanistic insight into the relation between rhIFN? aggregation and its immunogenicity. Transgenic C57Bl/6 mice immune tolerant for hIFN? have been applied as tools to study the breaking of immune tolerance by rhIFN?. RhIFN?-1a products formulated with HSA failed to induce antibodies in wildtype C57Bl/6 mice, which led to the conclusion that the transgenic C57Bl/6 mice cannot be used to study the immunogenicity of these products. For this reason, a second mouse model was developed by crossing the original transgenic C57Bl/6 mice with wildtype FVB/N mice. Both wildtype and transgenic C57Bl/6 x FVB/N hybrid offspring were used to evaluate the immunogenicity of three marketed products, Rebif (rhIFN?-1a), Avonex (rhIFN?-1a) and Betaferon (rhIFN?-1b). All products were immunogenic in wildtype hybrid mice, while the immunogenicity in transgenic hybrid mice was product dependent and in line with clinical observations. In conclusion, the hybrid mouse model offered unique possibilities to analyze the immunogenicity of a wide range of rhIFN? preparations, study factors that are of influence and look into the mechanism that is responsible for overcoming immune tolerance. The research described in this thesis led to greater insight in the mechanism by which rhIFN? aggregates overcome immune tolerance for the human protein. The transgenic immune tolerant mouse model that was developed acted as useful instrument for investigating the immunogenicity of a wide range of aggregated products. The transgenic mice enabled us to look into the features of the immune response induced by rhIFN? aggregates, the results of which indicate that CD4+ T cells as well as MZ B cells are involved but NABs and immunological memory are lacking within the time frame of the experiments. Not all rhIFN? aggregates were equally immunogenic, but removing aggregates eliminated the immune response against rhIFN? in transgenic mice. Aggregated rhIFN? preparations that were immunogenic in transgenic mice appeared to contain native-like protein. Moreover, it was shown that different pathways of oxidizing rhIFN? may lead to the formation of aggregates with greatly enhanced immunogenicity. Finally, it was demonstrated that rhIFN? adsorbs readily to common surface materials such as glass, metal and polystyrene. In particular complexes of rhIFN? with metal microparticles induced high levels of anti-rhIFN? IgG in transgenic mice, highlighting the importance of measuring and characterizing (sub)visible particulates in protein formulations'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Prognostic research is of growing importance. However, rarely are results from imaging techniques considered for medical prognostication, whilst prognostically promising unrequested imaging findings are increasingly being detected in daily routine care. Therefore this thesis aimed to contribute to the general knowledge of prognostic research and specifically to determine the prognostic relevance of unrequested imaging findings, detected on routine chest CT, in relation to cardiovascular disease (CVD). Regarding the first aim we began addressing the general methodology of prognostic research using data from the SMART study. First, the pro’s, con’s and recommendations concerning the reporting of composite-endpoints were discussed, followed by the presentation of an adaptation method, designed to accurately adjust absolute risks for a composite-endpoint to risks for the individual component outcomes. Secondly, we presented an ‘efficient’ method of composing a temporal validation cohort. This method replenishes a traditional temporal validation cohort with the left-truncated follow-up time of event-free patients censored at the end of a derivation-study. The major advantages were increased power and increased length of follow-up time, available for validation. Through both works we strove to improve upon current methodological practices aiming to improve the quality of future research. The bulk of this thesis addresses the second aim presenting results from the PROgnostic-Value-of-unrequested-Information-in-Diagnostic-Imaging study. We started with discussing the rationale that led to the initiation of this study. 10.410 subjects (>40 years without cardiovascular CT-indications) were followed for 4 years, in which 515 CVD events were ascertained. We found that vascular calcification (severe coronary calcification HR3.7, 95%CI 2.7-5.2; severe aortic calcification HR2.7, 95%CI 2.0-3.7) and valve calcification (severe Aortic valve-, Mitral valve- or Mitral annular calcification respectively HR’s 2.0, 95%CI 1.48-2.78; 2.1, 95%CI 1.04-4.19 and 1.5, 95%CI 1.13–2.08) were strong predictors of incident CVD events. The heart (HR1.04, 95%CI 1.03-1.06) and ascending thoracic diameter (HR1.002 , 95%CI 1.001-1.004) showed an exponential prognostic effect beyond respectively 11cm and 30mm; the descending aortic diameter (HR1.04 , 95%CI 1.01 – 1.13) and cardiothoracic diameter (HR1.06, 95%CI 1.04 -1.08) showed linear prognostic effects beyond respectively 25mm and a ratio of 0.45. Finally, we developed two different prediction models to identify patients who might benefit from preventative measures. A simple prediction model incorporating aortic calcifications, plus age, gender and CT-indication performed well in an external dataset (C-index 0.71, sensitivity 46%, specificity 76%). A more sophisticated CVD prediction rule (Triple-R score) was designed to establish the optimal combination of imaging findings for predicting CVD, and also to establish which findings may be omitted. The backward-specified Triple-R score incorporated age, gender, CT-indication, LAD calcification, Mitral valve calcification, descending aortic calcification and the heart- and ascending aortic diameter. At external validation the C-index was 0.72 and sensitivity and specificity was 46% was 79%. Compared to the simple risk score, the Triple-R score classified 7.8% of the patients into more accurate risk categories. In conclusion, we showed that unrequested imaging findings can be used for risk stratification purposes. Impact studies are needed to build upon and corroborate on our findings, before applying these results to daily practice.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The co-existence of high blood pressure and diabetes dramatically and synergistically increases the risk of microvascular and macrovascular complications. In order to reduce morbidity and mortality in these high risk patients, optimal blood pressure goals should be achieved. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARB) and diuretics(thiazide) are all effective antihypertensive agents in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) but none of them has shown superiority in either lowering blood pressure or reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in T2DM. The overall aim of this thesis was to gain greater insight into the interaction between antihypertensive drugs, genetic polymorphisms and new onset diabetes (NOD). Despite their superior efficacy in reducing blood pressure, physicians often withhold prescribing thiazide diuretics because of the increased risk of T2DM. In our study with treated hypertensive subjects, the risk of diabetes increased only with increasing thiazide dose. The combination of thiazide with ACEI’s or ARB’s was even less diabetogenic than thiazide monotherapy and the use of potassium supplementation or potassium sparing drugs in combination with thiazides did not show a protection against the development of diabetes. Low-dose thiazide therapy has shown to be the safest treatment in all treatment regimens with regard to the risk of diabetes and this association was also modified by polymorphisms in the salt sensitivity gene and RAAS genes. The response to ACEI’s and ARB’s, which have been proposed as possible protective agents against the development of diabetes in hypertensive subjects, was also modified by genetic variations in the RAAS. Our pharmacogenetic studies demonstrated that genetic variation can explain variation in response to RAAS inhibitors and thiazide diuretics and other antihypertensives with regard to the risk of diabetes mellitus. Based on these findings, we constructed a decision table which should facilitate the process of prescribing an appropriate treatment regimen for hypertensives with increased risk of diabetes, taking into account polymorphisms in relevant genes.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Staphylococcus aureus and healthcare-associated infections'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Many medical procedures breach or suppress patients’ natural defences, leaving them vulnerable to infections which would not occur in healthy humans: “healthcare-associated infections”. Healthcare-associated infections caused by the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) are probably the most feared, due to the invasive nature and the wide occurance of the pathogen. This thesis explored risk factors, diagnostic procedures, outcome and treatment options of a number of healthcare-associated infections caused by S. aureus, with a focus on bacteriuria, neurosurgical infections and intravascular catheter-associated infections. Eligible patients for the studies were identified through searches in microbiology laboratory management and information systems. The wide range of infections which S. aureus may cause, made the research questions and outcomes of the thesis quite diverse: 1. A relation between S. aureus bacteriuria (bacteria in the urine) and S. aureus bacteremia (bacteria in the bloodstream) has been described in the past. It was believed that bacteria reached the urine from the bloodstream. In our studies we found no evidence for this phenomenon. In fact, the opposite appears to be the case: S. aureus often invades the bloodstream from the urinary tract, and bacteriuria is risk factor for subsequent bacteremia. 2. The most frequently performed procedure in neurosurgery is the placement of cerebrospinal fluid drains, devices intended to lower intracranial pressure. Our studies found that when these drains are colonized with bacteria, the chance of developing meningitis is approximately fifty-two percent. This chance increases to over seventy percent when the colonizing micro-organism is S. aureus. Furthermore, cases of meningitis in neurosurgical patients experienced at the UMC Utrecht were evaluated to sharpen the diagnostic criteria for this complication. 3. Intravascular catheter-associated infections with S. aureus were investigated. Intravascular catheters, or “central lines”, are plastic tubes inserted in a major vein or artery, to administer medication, fluids and blood products, or to monitor blood pressure. Two studies within this thesis found that colonization of these catheters with S. aureus was such a strong risk factor for subsequent bacteremia, that prophylactic therapy was needed. To prevent one case of bacteremia, only eight patients required antibiotic treatment. Also, we studied patients with catheter-associated S. aureus bacteremia to quantify how the speed of medical interventions affects the survival of these patients. The two main actions a physician takes in these patients is to start antibiotic treatment and to remove the infected catheter. It was found that the relation between rapid therapeutic actions and outcome is so complex in this patient group, that all research performed thus far is inadequate to answer this question. 4. The heavy use of antibiotics in healthcare has rendered a large proportion of pathogenic micro-organisms resistant against many antimicrobial agents. New antibiotics are needed. To conclude this thesis, we describe how epilancin 15X, a novel antibiotic compound with activity against important healthcare-associated pathogens, was isolated from a strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis. Although epilancin 15X will not be directly usable to treat patients, the elucidation of its structure may lead to the development of actual antibiotics in the future.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Cognitive-Behavioral Self-Help Treatment for Nightmares and Insomnia'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Nightmares and insomnia are sleep disorders with serious consequences. Both sleep disorders can effectively be treated with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Because of its cost-effectiveness and promising effects, self-help CBT has been proposed as a first option within a stepped-care framework. CBT for insomnia and nightmares primarily consists of psycho-education about sleep and exercises to improve sleep-wake habits. Therefore, the use of CBT self-help manuals for sleep problems within a stepped care approach framework seems promising. This dissertation describes three large randomized controlled trials concerning self-help CBT for nightmares or insomnia. In the first nightmare RCT, 399 participants were randomized into Imagery Rehearsal Therapy - IRT (n = 103), exposure (n = 95), recording (n = 106) or waiting-list condition (n = 95). Results showed that nightmares can successfully be treated with self-help and that effectiveness is sustained in the long run. IRT alleviated nightmare frequency faster, but, unexpectedly, was equally effective to exposure. It seems thus that the desensitization to the feared image is the crucial element in nightmare treatment. In the second nightmare RCT, 278 participants were randomized into IRT (n = 70), IRT+ (with sleep hygiene; n = 76), Lucid Dreaming Therapy - LDT (n = 70), or waiting-list condition (n = 62). Results showed that in addition to IRT, sleep hygiene or lucid dreaming did not have a beneficial effect. For insomnia, a self-help CBT protocol was developed and its effectiveness was evaluated in a large RCT (N = 623) which compared Internet delivered self-help CBT to bibliotherapy and a waiting-list condition. We found that insomnia can effectively be treated with unsupported self-help CBT. Internet and bibliotherapy were equally effective at 4-week follow-up. However, the Internet condition had a higher dropout. Effects were sustained at 48-week follow-up, but surprisingly, symptoms of insomnia and secondary complaints decreased more in the Internet compared to the bibliotherapy condition. In conclusion, in this dissertation we found that unsupported self-help CBT can successfully ameliorate nightmares and insomnia. Sleep disorders can be specifically targeted and self-help treatments have an effect on primary sleep complaints. The nightmare studies demonstrated that self-help CBT decreased nightmare frequency. The insomnia study showed that CBT increased total sleep time, and decreased sleep onset latency as well as waking time after sleep onset. Moreover, indirect effects were found on affective complaints such as depression and anxiety. The effects were sustained in the long run, suggesting that not only face-to-face but also self-help CBT has better long-term effects than sleep medication. The unsupported self-help format is promising because it appears to be a cost-effective way to reach a large number of people with sleep disorders.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Brachytherapy is becoming an increasingly popular prostate cancer treatment, probably due to the specific advantages of the procedure, such as the minimal invasiveness and the lower chance of impotence and incontinence. Nonetheless, because of the long follow-up that is required to obtain prostate cancer related results, only recently a sufficient body of evidence has started to emerge to assess the cure rates of I125 prostate cancer brachytherapy. This thesis contributes to this body of evidence with long-term results, i.e. biochemical failure rates, prostate cancer specific survival and overall survival of a patient cohort treated with brachytherapy at the University Medical Center Utrecht in the last two decades. A strong association was found between several tumor characteristics, stratified into risk groups, and outcome as biochemical failure free survival and prostate cancer specific survival, the 10-year prostate cancer specific survival rates were, respectively, 96% for low risk, 87% for intermediate risk, and 69% for high risk prostate cancer. To aid clinicians and patients in choosing a curative prostate cancer treatment, nomograms have been developed that estimate the cancer free outcome probability after brachytherapy, prostatectomy or external beam radiotherapy. However, the predictive accuracy of nomograms, specifically when estimating the outcome after I-125 brachytherapy, is poor. This thesis concluded that, as long as the quality of the implant is optimal, primarily T stage, PSA at diagnosis and Gleason score seem to be associated with outcome, but not patients’ age or obesity. When combining these tumor characteristics in risk groups, results for low and intermediate risk are excellent with current standard of care. High risk prostate cancer, on the other hand, seem to be better off when treated in combination with external beam radiotherapy.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Identification of older hospitalized patients at risk for functional decline'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Between 30% and 60% of older patients experience functional decline after hospitalization, resulting in a decline in health-related quality of life and autonomy. This is associated with increased risk of readmission, nursing home placement and mortality, increased length of hospital stay and increased need for health care at home. A decreased functional status is a risk factor for the development of geriatric syndromes such as pressure ulcers, falls, delirium, incontinence and further functional decline. Functional decline is mostly defined as a decline in performing the activities of daily living (ADL) and/or instrumental activities of daily living (IADL). This functional decline is not necessarily related to the medical reason for the hospital admission but to the pre-admission health status and the iatrogenic effects of hospitalization. Effective and efficient hospital care for older patients starts with the identification of patients who are at risk for the development of functional decline. Therefore, the aim of this thesis was: To determine a prediction model to identify older patients at risk for functional decline after hospitalization that is easy to use in clinical practice as a first step in the prevention of a loss of function and independence. Functional decline was defined as a decline of at least one point on the Katz ADL index (six items: bathing, dressing, toileting, transferring, eating and the use of incontinence materials) at three months after admission compared to premorbid ADL status. One literature study and four prospective cohort studies (total n=1628) were conducted to develop and validate this prediction model. In the cohort studies the premorbid functional status was measured within 48 hours after admission by interview; patients were asked to describe the situation two weeks prior to admission to eliminate possible effects of the illness causing hospital admission. At follow up, three months after admission, functional status was measured again by telephone interview. This thesis describes the development of a prediction model to identify older patients at risk for functional decline after hospitalization in patients 65 years and older acutely admitted to the general internal wards of three hospitals. The AUC was 0.71, the Hosmer Lemeshow test showed P-value 0.95 indicating a good fitting model. The model was validated in an independent population of internal medicine patients and a population of cardiac surgery patients (both ? 65 years). A scorecard, Identification of Seniors At Risk–Hospitalized Patients (ISAR-HP), was developed based on this model. At threshold 2 (score ?2 indicating high risk for functional decline) the sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive value were 87%, 39%, 43% and 85%, respectively. Pre-admission need for assistance in IADL, use of a walking device, need for assistance in traveling, and no education after age 14 are the predictors of a model to identify older patients at risk for functional decline following hospital admission. This thesis also describes an the implementation of the results of this research into clinical practice, showing how the results of our studies can contribute to safe and targeted care for older hospitalized patients.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Self-management and early detection of exacerbations in patients with COPD'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Exacerbations of COPD are a major global importance. They have a profound negative effect on patients, resulting in poor health status; they accelerate the progression of the disease; and account for a large proportion the increasing healthcare spending on COPD. Yet, controversies remain over the definition of exacerbations, how they should be monitored and their underlying mechanisms. Early recognition of exacerbations and prompt treatment (decreased treatment delay) have shown to ameliorate recovery while improving health-related quality of life and reducing the risk of hospital admission. This thesis deals with different aspects of exacerbations, i.e. definitions, self-management behaviour during periods of symptom-aggravation and potential methods to enhance early detection and treatment of such events. To answer our main research questions we performed two systematic reviews, and three prospective cohort studies including a multicenter randomized trial (ACZiE study). In summary the main conclusions and recommendations were: 1) There is insufficient evidence to distinguish ‘harmless’ subtypes of exacerbations not necessitating anticipation by patients or healthcare providers. For now, current practice guidelines, indicating prompt recognition and treatment of each exacerbation, should be followed. 2) An individualized action plan is a low-burden intervention, which accelerates exacerbation recovery, severity and impact of exacerbations on health status. 3) Action plans are clearly not single-moment paper interventions, but concerns an individually tailored and dynamic process of systematic updates and reinforcement. Effective implementation requires a designated case-manager and clear arrangements between patients and healthcare providers. 4) Although evidence for effectiveness of telemedicine interventions is still relatively scarce, partly due to high heterogeneity of interventions, it has shown to be feasible in patients with COPD. Current technological developments provide an almost infinite variety of flexible solutions to closely monitor patients’ health status and to provide remote self-management support. 5) Strategies to enhance early detection and prompt treatment of exacerbations should be individually tailored. The pivotal objective remains to change patient behaviour for better disease control, and adequate anticipation in the event of an exacerbation. However, for certain sub-populations of patients this might not be sufficient and additional treatment modalities (surveillance / monitoring) might be indicated or should be augmented (self-management support / reinforcement). Future research implications were: 1) Before concluding EXACT-PRO to be the new ‘golden standard’, prospective studies are needed to evaluate its diagnostic properties in assessing exacerbation onset, covering the heterogeneity of COPD and its exacerbations. In absence of a ‘golden standard’, future prospective trials should assess exacerbations using the modified Anthonisen algorithm, completed by event–based counts. 2) To ensure optimal validity of diary-based exacerbation assessment, at least five vital requirements should be met (general discussion). 3) In addition to the importance of exacerbation frequency, future trials evaluating effectiveness of new treatments should also include severity, duration and health status impact. 4) Future trials are needed to compare simple and more sophisticated (tele-)monitoring modalities. Evaluation of effectiveness should also include exacerbation-related outcome: frequency, severity, duration and treatment-delay.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Imaging cerebral small vessel disease at 7 Tesla MRI'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Cerebral small vessel disease is a term often used to refer to lacunar infarcts, white matter lesions (WML) and microbleeds; lesions that are thought to be caused by changes in the small vessels of the brain. These lesions are commonly found in the general elderly population. However, it is hard to visualize these small vessels in vivo. As a result, lacunar infarcts, WML and microbleeds are adopted as marker of cerebral small vessel disease, and cerebral small vessel disease has become a synonym of brain parenchyma lesions. With the introduction of 7 Tesla MRI for clinical research, there are new opportunities to visualize the small, perforating arteries in the brain and to identify earlier stages of cerebral small vessel disease. The main aim of this thesis was to explore imaging biomarkers of early stages of cerebral small vessel disease with 7 Tesla MRI. Lacunar infarcts and WML are associated with stroke, cognitive decline and dementia in the general population. It is not known whether the presence of lacunar infarcts or WML imposes an additional risk of death or vascular events in patients with atherosclerosis, who already have a high risk of vascular events. We found that the presence of one or more lacunar infarcts on MRI increased the risk of death. WML increased the risk of vascular death and ischemic stroke. With time-of-flight MR angiography at 7T we were able to show the perforating arteries in the brain, without the use of contrast agents. The visualization of these small arteries in future studies may increase our understanding of infarcts in the deep brain structures supplied by these arteries. The presence of very small microbleeds could be one of the earliest manifestations of cerebral small vessel disease. We found that the use of a dual echo T2*-weighted sequence at 7T combines the advantages of a short and a long echo time for the visualization of microbleeds. The short echo time is beneficial to distinguish microbleeds from other structures with a high susceptibility, and with the long echo time a larger number of microbleeds can be detected. Comparing the dual echo T2*-weighted imaging at 7T with high resolution 3D T2*-weighted imaging at 1.5T, showed that the dual echo T2*-weighted imaging at 7T resulted in detection of microbleeds in more patients and also detection of a higher number of microbleeds. Furthermore, the detection of microbleeds was more reliable at 7T. As cerebral small vessel disease and iron deposition in the brain are both associated with endothelial dysfunction, we investigated iron deposition as a possible early marker of cerebral small vessel disease. Lacunar infarcts, but not WML or microbleeds, were associated with significantly more iron deposition. Besides increased permeability of the vessel wall, also the vascular reactivity may be altered due to changes in the vessel wall in patients with cerebral small vessel disease. With use of BOLD-fMRI at 7T a decreased vascular reactivity in the brain was found in patients with microbleeds, but not in patients with lacunar infarcts or WML. In conclusion, 7 Tesla MRI reveals several potential early biomarkers for cerebral small vessel disease and can be important for better understanding and early detection of cerebral small vessel disease.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The transcription factor engrailed 1 (En1) is essential in mdDA neuron maintenance, both during embryonic development and adulthood. The overall aims of this thesis were to unravel the function of En1, at a molecular level, in mdDA neuron development and to determine its relationship to canonical Wnt signalling during the specification of these neurons. We have disclosed the downstream cascades of En1 both in a dopaminergic cell line and in vivo (in the midbrain). The analysis of these data provides evidence that En1 is crucial for the induction of dopaminergic identity in mdDA neurons, being involved in the regulation of key mdDA genes, like Th, Aadc and Ahd2. Furthermore, we have unravelled the mechanism behind this regulation: En1 might be part of the Nurr1 transcriptional complex. We describe the interaction between En1 and the Nurr1 co-repressor Psf. Moreover, we show that En1 uses the same transcriptional mechanism in vivo as Nurr1 does on the Th promoter – i.e., En1 requires the release of HDAC-mediated repression for Th transcription to occur. These data suggest that En1 might be part of the Nurr1 transcriptional complex driving mdDA neuron specification. Wnt signaling is critical for proper brain development, including the mdDA system. However, it was not clear whether its activity overlaped with mdDA differentiation in later stages of midbrain development. We address this problem and demonstrate that canonical Wnt signaling is active in the midbrain mainly in the progenitor- and Nurr1-expression domains, while its activity is substantially reduced as development progresses. In addition, considering the known interaction between En1 and Wnt signaling in early development, we investigated whether En1 and canonical Wnt signalling might interact during mdDA neuron specification. We show that, around this developmental stage, the En1 mutant midbrain presents reduced ?-catenin activity, implicating En1 as a positive regulator of Wnt signaling. Furthermore, En1 and Nurr1 both interact with ?-catenin in vivo, leading to the hypothesis that ?-catenin, Nurr1 and En1 might be in a complex which could play a relevant role in early mdDA differentiation. Overall, our data contribute considerably to a deeper understanding of the mdDA system development, especially on how terminal differentiation in mdDA neurons is induced. Hopefully this knowledge will contribute to future improvement of cell replacement therapy in PD, whereby the specific differentiation of a stem cell into a DA neuronal phenotype is accomplished.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['This thesis summarizes the research performed by Pieter van Eijsden on two important aspects of the development of temporal lobe epilepsy: changes in white matter connectivity and hippocampal neurotransmitter imbalance. A major theme in this thesis is the characterization of changes that occur before the onset of spontaneous seizures in order to distinguish these from changes that occur due to spontaneous seizures. Connectivity: While epilepsy is historically viewed as a disease of grey matter, the research in this thesis shows that white matter tracts are also affected, and even before epilepsy manifests itself. A single epileptogenic event, in this case status epilepticus induced by lithium and pilocarpine, will induce chronic changes in the myelin component of the white matter. Some of these changes may contribute to epileptogenesis, others are probably merely an epiphenomenon. Neurotransmission: Previous research has shown an imbalance between excitatory glutamate and inhibitory GABA in the hippocampus of TLE patients. This thesis expands this finding to the pre-epileptic period, confirming that this is probably a cause and not (only) a consequence of seizures. It is shown that weeks before spontaneous seizures start, the imbalance is present, and that this is partially attributable to selective GABAergic cell death, but also due to an inability of the surviving GABAergic cells to turn over normal amounts of GABA. In addition, a reduction of glutamine synthetase activity is shown, which is hypothesized to be a consequence of the accumulation of glutamine, the precursor of GABA and glutamate. We propose that this represents an important step towards the development of epilepsy.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Antiplatelet therapy plays an important role in the treatment of cardiovascular disease. The combination of acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel is routine care in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) or undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). Although the effectiveness of antiplatelet therapy is well established, studies have shown interindividual variability in the response to both antiplatelet drugs. This variability in response results in complications at both ends of the therapeutic spectrum (bleeding or thrombosis). Common genetic variations and co-prescribed drugs modify the effectiveness of clopidogrel and acetylsalicylic acid. TH In this thesis, several common genetic variants in enzymes involved in the pharmacokinetics and –dynamics of clopidogrel and acetylsalicylic acid were found to modify the effectiveness of both drugs. Furthermore, the concomitant use of certain proton pump inhibitors, calcium channel blockers and sulfonylureas was associated with an impaired response to clopidogrel.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The implementation of low-molecular-weight-heparine (LMWH) bridging therapy in the standard treatment of patients with nonmassive pulmonary embolism (PE), has led to high interests in the treatment of patients with PE on an outpatient basis. To enable outpatient treatment of these patients, it is of utmost importance to identify patients at low risk for adverse clinical outcome. Therefore, insights in risk stratification were the initial focus of this thesis. We identified risk factors for serious adverse events during the first 10 days of treatment and developed a prognostic model for short term adverse events in patients with PE. We describe a prospective, multicenter management study of 152 low risk patients with acute PE, who were treated as outpatients. Low risk was defined as being hemodynamic stable and having a low N-terminal-pro-Brain Natriuretic Peptide (NT-proBNP level) (<500 pg/ml). No deaths, major bleedings or recurrent venous thromboembolism occurred in the first 10 days of treatment or in the follow-up period of 3 months in these patients. We concluded that outpatient treatment of a selected group of low risk patients with non-massive acute PE and a NT-proBNP level <500 pg/ml appears to be safe. Approximately 45% of the patients with acute PE are candidates for home treatment. Out of hospital therapy is considered to be convenient by the vast majority of the patients and it can contribute to the reduction of health care costs. Next to outpatient treatment early discharge is also conceivable, for example after normalization of the NT-proBNP level during hospitalization. We investigated if early discharge before reaching an adequate international normalized ratio (INR), results in the same quality of treatment compared to patients who are hospitalized until reaching an adequate INR. Our study showed that the development of guidelines for early discharge of a selected group of low risk PE patients is warranted, with focus on intensification of monitoring of INR values to shorten the period of the combination of LMWH and oral anticoagulation therapy. Continuation of the LMWH for at least 5 days after diagnosis of PE remains important as well. In case that the INR drops below the therapeutic range (“under-anticoagulation”), LMWH should be restarted. Finally, outpatient treatment is convenient and will reduce costs of medical care. However, the main focus of the outpatient treatment should remain patient’s safety. This thesis gives more insights in the risk stratification in PE-patients and contributes to the implementation of guidelines for outpatient treatment of low risk patients. However, before we are that far, further validation of the results is warranted.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Every living organism has an biological clock regulating endogenous melatonin production, synchronized by exogenous impulses like daylight, temperature and feeding. Inappropriately applied bright light disturbs this melatonin rhythm. Some large swine producers apply artificial light three times a day for three hours; we compared the 24 hour melatonin rhythm of pigs in a large swine production unit with pigs in a farm with natural light schemes (chapter two). No significant differences were found comparing mean melatonin levels of both farms of different light and feeding phases. We measured salivary melatonin concentrations after a single dose melatonin at 11 a.m. in three patients with worsening sleep quality after initial good response to melatonin treatment (chapter three). These levels remained above 50 pg/mL, in contrast to levels found in three controls with sustained response to melatonin. After resuming melatonin treatment with a considerably lower dose sleep problems disappeared, suggestive of slow melatonin hepatic CYP1A2 metabolisation. In patients with loss of response to melatonin, a melatonin clearance test and a considerably dose reduction is advised. In chapter four the meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety of exogenous melatonin in advancing sleep-wake rhythm in patients with delayed sleep phase disorder is described. Five trials including 91 adults and four trials including 226 children showed that melatonin treatment advanced mean DLMO by 1.18 hours and clock hour of sleep onset (SOT) by 0.67 hours. Melatonin decreased sleep-onset latency (SOL) by 23.27 minutes. In conclusion, melatonin is effective in advancing sleep-wake rhythm and DLMO in delayed sleep phase disorder. In chapter five a post-hoc analysis of two previously published trials in children with CSOI assessing onset and stability of the therapeutic effect of 4-weeks melatonin treatment is described. One week and four weeks of melatonin treatment showed a phase-advance of SOT from 22:05 to 20:45 hrs. respectively 21:09 hrs. and SOL decreased from 53 min to 18 respectively 25 min. The onset of melatonin treatment effect can be expected within a few days after commencement and remains stable after that. The Meldos study (chapter six) aimed to establish a dose–response relationship for melatonin 0.05, 0.1, 0.15 mg/kg or placebo in advancing DLMO, SOT, and reducing SOL in 72 children aged 6-12 yrs with CSOI in a 1-week randomized, double-blind trial. Treatment with melatonin significantly advanced SOT and DLMO by 1 hour and decreased SOL by 35 min. This effect of melatonin was not dose related but increased with an earlier circadian time of administration. Melatonin 0.05 mg/kg given at least 1-2 hrs before DLMO and before desired bedtime is effective for treatment of CSOI in children. After mean 3.1 yrs, we evaluated pubertal development, sleep quality and mental health development of 51 former Meldos participants with questionnaires (chapter seven). Mean questionnaire scores did not differ significantly from published scores of the general Dutch population of the same age and sex, indicating that melatonin treatment (mean dose 2.69 mg) in children may be sustained over a long period of time without deviation of sleep, puberty and mental health.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Intriguing advances have been made in recent years in identifying the mechanisms and consequences of genetic diversity and immune defects of pattern recognition receptors in innate immunity. The subject of this thesis is the interplay between the gene, protein and disease for two of these receptors: mannose-binding lectin (MBL) and L-ficolin. By studying genotypes, protein levels and functionality in a cohort of hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia and in an outbreak of legionellosis, we aimed to obtain more insight into the reciprocal effect of these proteins and pneumonia on each other, in the light of the genetic background of the patients. Both MBL and L-ficolin are part of the complement system of innate immunity, sharing similarities in structure and function. Both proteins have trimeric collagen-like subunits assembled into higher order oligomers, held together by disulfide bridges at the cysteine-rich N-terminal domain. The multimeric structure exposes multiple ligand-binding C-terminal heads: carbohydrate-recognition domains for MBL and fibrinogen-like domains for L-ficolin. This enables the binding of repeating molecular patterns on pathogens with high avidity, resulting in complement activation and in opsonization for phagocytosis. Multiple genetic polymorphisms in the gene encoding MBL lead to impaired oligomerization, resulting in deficiency of functional MBL. The gene encoding L-ficolin revealed to be highly polymorphic as well, with two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) leading to an altered substrate binding affinity of the protein. Both genes harbor promoter SNPs that influence plasma protein levels. MBL deficiency has been associated with an increased risk in infection. Conflicting results have been published on the effect of MBL deficiency on pneumococcal infections. In our cohort of community-acquired pneumonia, we did not find an association between MBL genotypes and pneumococcal infection. MBL-sufficient genotypes were more frequently found in a small group of patients with atypical pneumonia. In a large outbreak of legionellosis at a Dutch flower show, MBL genotypes were not a risk factor for legionellosis. However, patients with legionellosis displayed deficient MBL-mediated complement activation even with MBL-sufficient genotypes. Together, these genotypical and functional data suggest that the observed deficiency of lectin pathway activation is an effect of legionellosis rather than a risk factor for acquiring it. MBL and L-ficolin both revealed to act as acute-phase reactants in community-acquired pneumonia. However, the effect of genetic variants on this response differed between the two proteins. With MBL, the acute phase responsiveness was highly dependent upon the genotype. With L-ficolin, the genotype only determined variations in the protein levels, not in the acute-phase responsiveness itself. At the first glance MBL and L-ficolin look very much alike, with similar protein domains, multimeric structure, pattern recognition and complement activating properties. Yet the small differences in exactly these characteristics may give rise to essential differences in biological function, and this might have driven the different evolutionary strategies in shaping polymorphisms of the genes. In their similarities and differences, MBL and L-ficolin are an excellent example of one of nature’s successful strategies: creating necessary redundancy, without unnecessary abundance'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Aims: This thesis addresses the necessity of prophylactic antipsychotic treatment in first-episode schizophrenia patients and the effect of discontinuation of antipsychotics on brain volume and side-effects as well as the usage of these medications in general practice. Furthermore, the influence of the delay of antipsychotic treatment during the prodromal and psychotic phase of schizophrenia on brain volume and outcome in first-episode schizophrenia patients was researched and discussed. Methods and results: Chapter 2 describes a study in which remitted first-episode schizophrenia patients were randomised to discontinuation, or continuation of their antipsychotic treatment. These patients had been clinically stable for at least one year before participation. Additionally a pooled analysis was performed of this and one other study that researched randomised discontinuation in comparable schizophrenia patients. We found a markedly increased risk of a psychotic relapse after gradual discontinuation of antipsychotic medication in these first-episode schizophrenia patients compared to continuation. In Chapter 3 we studied the effect of discontinuation of atypical antipsychotic medication on brain volume change during a one-year interval in remitted and stable first-episode schizophrenia patients. Patients discontinuing atypical antipsychotics decreased in nucleus accumbens and putamen volume over time, but did not change in gray matter volume or any other global brain volume measure compared to continuation. Chapter 4 describes the decrease in body mass index found after discontinuing antipsychotics, while no decrease in extrapyramidal symptoms was identified. In Chapter 5 we investigated the association between duration of untreated illness (DUI), 5-year brain volume change, and clinical outcome at 5-year follow-up in first-episode schizophrenia patients. Mainly, we found no association between DUI and volume change during the first five years of psychotic illness. We did identify correlations of symptom scores after 5-year follow-up with both DUI and brain volume (change). In Chapter 6 a case control study in an electronic database is described, in which initiation of antipsychotic therapy in the general practice was associated to seven International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC) diagnostic categories. We found that general practitioners did not often initiate antipsychotic therapy and in 50% they failed to register the reason for it in terms of an ICPC-code. Initiation of antipsychotics was associated with four ICPC diagnostic categories that are no approved indications for antipsychotic treatment in The Netherlands. GPs mainly prescribed typical antipsychotics, however the incidence of initiating treatment with atypical antipsychotics increased almost threefold over the study period. Conclusions: It appears that the markedly increased risk of relapse after discontinuation of antipsychotic therapy in remitted and stable first-episode schizophrenia patients may not outweigh the advantages of medication discontinuation. Identified advantages are weight loss and possible reversal of atypical antipsychotic-induced putamen and nucleus accumbens increase. Furthermore, the gray matter deficits identified in schizophrenia patients appear to be unrelated to medication. In schizophrenia it seems that excessive tissue loss over time during the first five years of the illness and DUI explain a different part of the variation in symptomatic and functional outcome. Additionally, general practitioners seem to prescribe antipsychotics off-label in part of their patients'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The general goal of this thesis is to create a better insight into the genes and signaling proteins that influence the response of colorectal cancer cells to MEK-targeted therapy and chemotherapy (5-FU and oxaliplatin). In chapter 2 of this thesis we set out to explore the mechanisms of resistance to inhibition of the MEK/ERK pathway. We found that mutant KRAS allows colorectal cancer cells to compensate for the loss of ERK activity by activating an alternative signaling pathway. Chemotherapeutics induce DNA-damage by various mechanisms, which prompts the tumor suppressor gene TP53 to halt the cell cycle and either repair the damage or induce programmed cell death. In order to recommence the cell cycle following DNA repair,cells have to remain ‘competent’ for continued cell cycle progression. In chapter 3 we show that the wild type p53-induced phosphatase (Wip1) enables cells to resume the cell cycle after DNA repair has been completed. We and others previously observed an increased sensitivity of KRAS mutated colorectal cancer cells to 5-FU and oxaliplatin (53;54). This suggested that mutant KRAS could be of predictive value in the context of conventional chemotherapy treatment. In chapter 4 we elucidated the mechanism underlying this observation. The pro-apoptoticprotein Noxa (Latin for damage) was a crucial factor in sensitizing tumor cells to apoptosis. We also show that both mutant KRAS and wild type p53 are required for Noxa induction and for sensitization to apoptosis. In chapter 5 we studied whether the combination of wildtype p53 and oncogenic KRAS was associated with increased response rates to oxaliplatin and fluoropyrimidine based chemotherapy in a cohort of colorectal cancer patients. We performed mutation analysis for both KRAS and TP53 in patients and correlated them with response to chemotherapy. After our discovery that upregulation of the pro-apoptotic gene Noxa (and hence neutralization of Mcl-1 and A1) was essential for oxaliplatin-induced apoptosis (chapter 4), we hypothesized that neutralization of the other Bcl-2 pro-survival proteins could synergize with oxaliplatin in inducing tumor cell apoptosis. Indeed in chapter 6, we show that the small molecule Bcl-2/Bcl-w/Blc-xL-inhibitor ABT-737 and oxaliplatin induce apoptosis of colorectal tumor cells in a synergistic fashion, both in vitro and in tumor xenografts'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Women who want to know whether their breast cancer or the breast cancer in their family is hereditary can request a referral for genetic counselling. Those who are the first in their family to request breast cancer genetic counselling often don’t know what to expect or have unrealistic expectations. Their initial breast cancer genetic counselling visits are mainly educational in nature, with large amounts of relatively standard information and little counselee participation. These visits might not optimally fulfil counselees’ information needs. Therefore, a pre-visit website, called E-info geneca, was developed with the aim to help counselees to prepare for their first visit and to pursue a more active role in the visit. We conducted a study of the effects of this pre-visit website E-info geneca on counselees’ expectations, communication in the visit and post-visit outcomes. 197 Counselees were randomized to receive usual care (UC) or UC plus the pre-visit website. The website provided counselees with computer-tailored information and a question prompt sheet (QPS) on which counselees could write their questions for the visit. These questions were sent to the counsellor pre-visit. All counselees completed a pre- and post-visit questionnaire and visits were videotaped. We studied effects on the communication in the visit, counselees’ information recall, knowledge about breast cancer and heredity, fulfilment of needs, risk perception accuracy, anxiety and perceived personal control, using multilevel regression analyses. After having accessed E-info geneca counselees better knew what to expect of their first visit and less often had unrealistic expectations about possibilities for DNA-testing than counselees in the UC group. In the visit, counselees in the intervention group more often shared their agenda, directed the flow of the visit and paraphrased the counsellors’ words. Counsellors consistently introduced and answered the QPS questions. As a result, counsellors provided more information about preventive options, risk of family members and inheritance if this was requested and the information provided was more specific to the individual counselee. Post-visit, counselees in the intervention group remembered more of the information provided in the visit. They also had more knowledge of breast cancer and heredity and reported better fulfilment of information needs than counselees in the UC group. The effects of the intervention were strongest for those counselees who did not receive an indication for DNA-testing, their recall scores showed more increase and their anxiety levels dropped more in the intervention compared to UC group. No intervention effects were found after the first visit on accuracy of risk perception or perceived personal control. This study shows that pre-counselling education, using tailored information technology, facilitates counselees to better prepare themselves for their first visit for breast cancer genetic counselling. This leads to more effective first visits, in particular for counselees who received no indication for DNA-testing and therefore had no indication for a second visit. Future study should focus on the effects of the website on the outcomes after a complete series of visits'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['It is known that the origins of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in western societies, start early in life. However, it is not known what determinants are related to the vascular system in the young. In this thesis we studied the relation of specific determinants, including smoking during pregnancy, overweight, breast feeding and genes with cardiovascular risk factors and vascular characteristics in individuals aged 4 weeks, 5 years, and young adult age. Early life determinants We showed that smoke exposure during pregnancy was associated with thicker carotid intima media thickness (CIMT) in the young adult offspring. This association was independent of active smoking of the offspring. In an additional study we showed that smoking during pregnancy was related to both arterial wall stiffness and thickness in 5 year old offspring. This finding was independent of confounders. We concluded that smoking during pregnancy has a direct influence on the offspring’s vasculature in early childhood, which is still visible in young adulthood. Moreover, it was shown that healthy infants from mothers who smoked during pregnancy had 5.4 mmHg higher systolic blood pressure than infants not exposed to smoke during pregnancy. This observation was seen after adjusting for confounders. We concluded that the relation between smoking during pregnancy and offspring blood pressure is set in utero. Furthermore we showed that children at the age of 5 years, who had been exclusively breastfed in infancy for 3 to 6 months had an increased CIMT compared to those exclusively formula fed. Children exclusively breastfed for either less than 3 months or for more than 6 months showed no difference in CIMT compared to formula fed children. Additionally, no significant differences in carotid stiffness were observed. In conclusion, the duration of exclusive breastfeeding in infancy is related to CIMT at the age of 5 years in children exclusively breastfed for 3 to 6 months. Classical risk factors Overweight, a known CVD risk factor in adults, is an increasing public health threat in adults and particularly in children. It is unknown at what age overweight starts to takes its toll on the vasculature. We showed that increased body weight was related to thicker carotid arterial wall and increased stiffness. Specifically, increased measures of intra-abdominal fat were related to thicker arterial walls and increased stiffness, independent of BMI. These results demonstrate that increased general body mass, and particularly body fat distribution, are related to thicker and stiffer arteries already early in life. Genes Recently, twelve loci were identified in a genome wide association study as related to blood pressure independent of body mass index. This association could be confirmed in eight of these loci. We found that two SNPs that were not confirmed for an association with blood pressure, did show a relation with body size, a strong determinant of blood pressure, in young adults. No relations with waist-to-hip ratio were found with the blood pressure associated SNPs. Overall, these findings indicate that both genetic and environmental factors influence the cardiovascular system already from early life onwards'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['As this thesis discusses, an incompatible situation arises when toxicity predominates over efficacy particularly in case high cumulative doses of GCs have been used. This has stigmatised their usage, which is often unwarranted when GC therapy is applied with sufficient precautionary measures (safety). The most obvious example is osteoporosis prophylaxis in patients on long-term GC therapy. When the three dimensions or axes related to the use of GCs namely efficacy, toxicity and safety of GC therapy are balanced, a good benefit-risk ratio and harmonious situation exist: a compatible triangle. The main message from the first axis or theme ‘efficacy’ is that low-to-medium dose systemic GCs indeed deserve to be part of modern treat-to-target or tight control RA treatment strategies, as GCs are DMARDs and clearly improve the prognosis of RA patients. Whether the DMARD-effect of GC co-therapy persists after 2 years of treatment remains yet to be investigated, and also whether the triangle of dimensions stays compatible during chronic GC-treatment for this purpose. The second theme ‘toxicity’ points out that patients on chronic GC-treatment still suffer from a high incidence of vertebral fractures; also disturbed glucose metabolism was detected in a substantial number of RA patients with established disease, both in those on GC therapy and those without GCs. With regards to these 2 co-morbidities, it is still not clear what the direct effects of GCs are, and what the effects of disease activity. More research on the basic mechanisms of GC-related osteoporosis and glucose intolerance, especially in randomised placebo-controlled GC studies with frequent longitudinal assessments is needed, also in patients chronically treated with GCs. The results of such investigations could suggest potential mechanisms for new (prophylactic) therapies, aimed at e.g. specific adipocytokines and bone regulating cytokines, through which the triangle of GC-use would become more compatible. Significant focus of future studies on long-term GC-use should be on other, e.g. cardiovascular AEs. Safety is the third theme of GC-use and of crucial importance for the compatibility of the triangle of GC-use; associated with both efficacy and toxicity. Based on a review of GC-associated AEs, a broad set of recommendations has been formulated to prevent or treat these AEs during treatment. This enables safer long-term use of GCs and enhances the compatibility of the GC-use triangle. However, for interpretation of AEs, the direct effects of GCs and the effects of disease activity proved to be difficult to unravel; most recommendations are not fully evidence-based by lack of data.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is applied to non-invasively visualize patient’s anatomy and tumour suspicious regions with superior soft tissue contrast. Amongst others, online MRI is valuable in the diagnostic and treatment techniques for prostate cancer. Clinical MR scanners are suitable to perform MRI-guided needle interventions, such as biopsies and brachytherapy, but the access to the patient in the narrow MR bore is limited. Therefore, robotic devices have to be developed to execute these diagnostic and treatment techniques. This thesis describes the development and quality assurance of the University Medical Center Utrecht (UMCU) robot. Furthermore, it reports the first in vivo experiences with this robot and discusses its possible future applications. Chapter 1 is a general introduction to this research. In Chapter 2, the results are presented of a feasibility study on the dose coverage in low-dose rate brachytherapy using divergent needle insertion methods, as could theoretically be established inside the MR scanner applying the UMCU robot. The study revealed that with the divergent needle methods adequate dose distributions in the prostate can be achieved. Chapter 3 describes a new method to detect undesired situations with risk of tissue heating around the needle tip caused by the radiofrequency (RF) waves needed to generate MR images during interventional procedures. The method is based on the RF induced image artefacts and quantifies the induced current inside the needle. The method is effective for detecting potentially dangerous situations non-invasively. In Chapter 4, development considerations and quality assurance methods of MRI-guided robotic devices dedicated for needle interventions are listed. It provides background information on how to deal with the MRI-related challenges, such as accessibility, MR compatibility, needle placement accuracy and safety, before the devices can be safely applied on patients. Chapter 5 reports the proof of principle of our robot. Four fiducial gold markers were placed under MRI guidance inside the prostate of a prostate cancer patient using the UMCU robot. The needle could automatically be inserted and tracked using fast MR scans. Despite an advanced needle insertion technique (tapping), prostate deformations up to 7 mm were measured, which implies that improvement of the tapping device for further reduction of tissue deformation is needed. In Chapter 6, it is investigated whether single shot MR tagging can be used to quantify local prostate deformations due to the needle insertion. Single shot MR tagging creates artificial landmarks in the prostate which deform with the actual tissue deformations. The method can for example be used to better position the needle during the intervention or to assure the needle insertion quality of robotic devices. Chapter 7 summarizes the various studies of this thesis and discusses the future applications of the UMCU robot, such as online MRI-guided prostate brachytherapy and biopsies. To our knowledge, the UMCU robot is the first and up-to-now the only robotic device in the world that performed a needle insertion in patients inside an MR scanner, while tracking the needle using online MRI.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is a highly prevalent chronic disorder in which retrograde flow of gastric contents into the oesophagus causes troublesome symptoms or lesions. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy controls reflux disease in 95% of the patients and the remaining 5% have PPI-refractory GORD. Patients with PPI-refractory GORD, unwillingness to take lifelong medication or extra-oesophageal manifestations are candidates for anti-reflux surgery. Candidates for antireflux surgery with erosive reflux disease on upper endoscopy and/or pathological reflux in supine or bipositional body position with a positive symptom-reflux association during 24-h pH metry, have a classic indication for antireflux surgery. The aims of this study were (I) to explore indications for laparoscopic antireflux surgery, (II) to compare fundoplication techniques and (III) evaluate physiological effects. Consecutive cohort studies proved that candidates for antireflux surgery with isolated upright reflux, oesophageal acid hypersensitivity, negative symptom-reflux correlation or non-erosive reflux disease benefit from laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (LNF) as much as those with classic indications for surgery. Consequently, indications for antireflux surgery should be broadened and fundoplication should not be withheld from these patients. On the other hand, patients with poor oesophageal peristalsis or high supine acid exposure before surgery should be counselled about their higher chance of recurrent reflux after LNF. A cohort study in 2040 patients demonstrated that tailoring the degree of fundoplication based on preoperative oesophageal motility is probably not necessary, since oesophageal peristalsis before surgery has no impact on postfundoplication dysphagia. A small cohort study found that LNF for failed endoluminal EsophyX fundoplication provides satisfactory reflux control, but is associated with a risk of gastric perforations during LNF and a high rate of postfundoplication dysphagia. The ten-year results of a randomised clinical trial (RCT) in 146 patients demonstrated that laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery reduces the reoperation rate for incisional hernia (2.5%versus13.0%) with similar long-term effectiveness compared with conventional fundoplication. Surgeon experience, however, affected early outcome of laparoscopic fundoplication and this pleads for centralisation of expertise. LNF is the most frequently performed operation for GORD. Dysphagia and gas-related symptoms are the main side-effects of LNF and a study that preformed impedance monitoring before and after LNF demonstrated that the latter are caused by a reduction in the number of gastric belches that is accompanied by an increase in oesophageal belching. Partial laparoscopic anterior (LAF) and Toupet fundoplication (LTF) have been proposed to reduce these symptoms. The 5-year results of 4 RCTs in 425 patients demonstrated that 90 LAF provides inferior long-term reflux control compared with LNF. In contrast, 180 LAF reduced dysphagia and gas-related symptoms compared with LNF, with similar long-term control of reflux symptoms. In a meta-analysis of RCTs, LTF was associated with fewer reinterventions (3.1%versus7.0%), less dysphagia and fewer gas-related symptoms, with similar reflux control compared with LNF. A subsequent impedance study shed light on the physiological origin of these findings and found that LNF and LTF similarly control acid and weakly acidic reflux, with a smaller reduction of gastric belches. Therefore, 180 LAF and LTF should be considered the surgical procedure of choice for GORD'],\n",

       "  'Description': [\"The purpose of this dissertation was to generate a broad overview of children’s exposure to and recovery from trauma in order to promote theory building and the design of prevention and intervention activities. First, a general population study was conducted in 1770 primary school children. They filled out a questionnaire in a quiet classroom setting. Fourteen percent of the children reported traumatic exposure, a figure that is relatively low compared to American findings. We did not find differences in exposure based on gender, ethnicity, or region of residence. Second, we studied the psychosocial well-being (quality of life, posttraumatic stress, and posttraumatic growth) of the general population sample. Posttraumatic stress and quality of life showed a positive association. Posttraumatic growth and posttraumatic stress were positively related to each other as well, implying that trauma-specific negative and positive consequences can co-exist. In the third paper, we described the development and validation of the Children’s Responses to Trauma Inventory (CRTI), a child-oriented questionnaire to measure posttraumatic stress in children. Based on the general population sample and a number of earlier studies, it was concluded that the CRTI is a promising instrument. After that, we reviewed longitudinal studies on posttraumatic stress in children in a meta-analysis. We looked at the theoretical basis of studies and at evidence for risk and protective factors. Explicit theoretical frameworks were present in a minority of the studies. Important predictors of long-term posttraumatic stress in children and adolescents were symptoms of acute and short-term posttraumatic stress, depression, anxiety, and parental posttraumatic stress. Female gender, injury severity, duration of hospitalization, and elevated heart rate shortly after hospitalization yielded small effect sizes. Age, minority status, and socioeconomic status were not significantly related to long-term posttraumatic stress reactions. In order to combine large-scale quantitative information with in-depth qualitative knowledge, we subsequently studied children’s and parents’ views on recovery from trauma in semi-structured interviews (25 children and 33 parents). Our fifth paper described children’s perspectives. The long aftermath of a traumatic event, the experience of step-by-step recovery including positive elements, and feeling supported by friends, parents, and cuddly toys were important to the children, and they showed a wide variety of coping behaviors. In the sixth paper we focused on parents’ perspectives on recovery of their child. Responsive parenting was a central theme in the interviews. It consisted of being aware of a child’s needs and acting upon these needs. Fourteen strategies, such as comparing behavior with siblings' behavior and providing opportunities to talk, were identified. Finally, we studied teachers’ views on supporting children who have been exposed to trauma. We carried out 21 semi-structured interviews and conducted a follow-up with a questionnaire filled out by 765 teachers in a national sample. Teachers struggled with their role, and searched for better knowledge and skills. One of the main dilemma’s faced by the teachers was how to balance a mission of education with a need to help individual students. The clinical implications of the findings are further discussed in the dissertation.\"],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Farnesoid X Receptor activation protects against intestinal inflammation: potential mechanisms and therapeutic implications'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic intestinal inflammatory disorder, characterized by dysregulation of the mucosal immune system and compromised intestinal epithelial barrier. In IBD the immunological balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators is severely impaired and shifted towards the pro-inflammatory side. The nuclear transcription factor kappa B is a key regulator in this shift. The bile salt nuclear Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) is a member of the nuclear receptors (NRs) superfamily, mainly expressed in the ileum and liver. Once activated by bile salts, it regulates transcription of genes involved in bile salt homeostasis. Moreover it is also implicated in liver regeneration, carcinogenesis, energy expenditure, as well as lipid and glucose homeostasis. In this thesis, we aimed to explore the role of FXR in maintaining a healthy gut and the potential therapeutic implications of FXR pharmacological activation for IBD. Functional cross-talk between NF-?B and several NRs exists. NRs were shown to have anti-inflammatory properties, by interfering with NF-?B function and activated NF-?B is described to inhibit several NRs activity. We have recently found that pharmacological FXR activation decreases the severity of inflammation and preserves the intestinal barrier integrity in two murine colitis models. Moreover, it decreases mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory genes and increases expression of antibacterial defense genes. Moreover FXR activation inhibits inflammatory signalling in various primary human immune cell types and in lamina propria mononuclear cells from IBD patients. In another study we show that there is mutual crosstalk between FXR and NF-?B in different model systems. Firstly, the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF? decreases FXR target gene expression in enterocyte-like cells. This finding was confirmed in ileal specimens of WT mice cultured ex vivo, and in vivo in mice with severe intestinal inflammation. Finally, ileal expression of the FXR target gene SHP is 50% lower in patients with one of the IBD phenotype, Crohn’s disease. Taken together, these findings show that FXR is not only an active player in inhibition of inflammation, but also is a target of the inflammatory response itself. The classical mechanism by which FXR regulates gene transcription is via transactivation. Beside that, we provide evidence for a novel FXR role in transrepressing NF-?B signaling. We started dissecting the mechanisms for classical transactivation and transrepression of FXR, by identification and characterization of a novel phosphorylation site on FXR-S224. Disruption of this site revealed that it is essential for FXR target gene transactivation, but not for transrepression of NF-?B signalling. These findings potentially advance drug design for FXR, since selective FXR ligands which do not result in S224 phosphorylation may be useful to treat hepatic/intestinal inflammation without interfering with metabolism, finally reducing potential side effects. The results described in this thesis indicate that FXR is an important player in the counter-regulation of intestinal inflammation. Although the exact mechanism is still unclear, there are strong indications that modulation of FXR expression/activity may be transferred from bench to bedside, by using it as a drug target for intestinal inflammatory disorders.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['This thesis aimed at exploring immunological aspects of mainly obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) as well as generalized social anxiety disorder (GSAD), major depressive disorder (MDD) and psychosis. First we reviewed nearly 100 clinical studies on immunological disturbancesin anxiety disorders.In particular, OCD and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been associated with mostly inconsistent alterations in the immune system. However, some findings,such as TNF-α disturbances in OCD appear to be reliable and reproducible across different studies. This is supported by our findings of significant lowerlipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated TNF-αlevels and decreased NK activity in OCD patients relative to controls. To examine the specificity of the observed immune alterations in OCD, we compared OCD patients, GSAD patients and healthy controls. OCD patients differed from healthy controls with respect to LPS stimulated levels of IL-6, while no statistically significant differences were found between GSAD patients and healthy controls. Direct comparison between OCD and GSAD patients yielded a trend towards lower IL-6 levels in OCD patients. These results underline the diversity of immune alterations in anxiety disorders. To study whether the observed immune alterations in OCD were state dependent we explored, in a small study, the immune function during a standardized provocation paradigm. We found thatLPS stimulated production of TNF-αand IL-6 by peripheralleucocytes decreased during exposure to disgust-relatedobjects in OCD patients but not in healthycontrols, indicating that specific immune factors are affected by the state an OCD patient is in. We hypothesized a role of the noradrenergic system during exposure to explain the observed changes in TNF-αand IL-6 levels. To explore the impact of treatment on the immune status of OCD patients, we studied the effect of antidepressants in a randomized controlled design. The results show that immune parameters were not significantly affected by a 12-week trial with either paroxetine or venlafaxine neither in responders nor in non-responders to treatment. In addition we studied, in an explorative design, the immune and neuroendocrine response on electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in 12 MDD patients. We found that ECT had an immediate, but transient, effect on several immune and neuroendocrine parameters while consecutive session of ECT showed no additional effect, indicating that this treatment has no lasting effect on immune or neuroendocrine functions. This could suggest that the acute biological changes in response to ECT, as observed in our study, are not involved in its therapeutic effects. Finally we studied neuroendocrine and immune parameters in medication-naïve male patients suffering from a first episode of psychosis, and 15 healthy controls, during a public speaking task. While previous studies suggested that schizophrenia is associated with a blunted stress response, we found that this blunting is already present in medication-naive patients with a first episode of psychosis. This implies that impairments in stress processing are either related to the psychosis or already present before the onset of the first psychotic episode and may be considered an endophenotype or vulnerability factor.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Background The majority of patients admitted to Intensive Care Units (ICUs) require an artificial airway and mechanical ventilation (MV). An important aspect of airway management in these patients is to remove secretions by endotracheal suctioning. Multiple use closed suction systems (CSS) are increasingly replacing single-use open suction system (OSS) to perform this invasive procedure. However, recommendations for the routine use of CSS remained controversial because of inconclusive study results. Objective The objective was to determine effectiveness of closed and open suction systems with respect to (1) reducing the incidence of cross-transmission and acquisition with Gram-negative bacteria in intensive care units, (2) reducing changes in cardiorespiratory variables, and (3) costs. Furthermore, based upon the microbiological results in this study, we determined (4) risk factors for acquiring respiratory tract colonization with Gram-negative bacteria, (5) acquisition of antibiotic resistance, and (5) the population structure of P. aeruginosa isolated from intensive care patients as compared with isolates from cystic fibrosis patients. Results In a prospective crossover design with fixed periods in which either of both systems was used for all patients in the intensive care unit, 37% of the patients acquired respiratory tract colonization with at least one of the selected Gram-negative bacteria in each of the study periods. Overall acquisition rates were 35.5 and 32.5 per 1000 patient days at risk during CSS and OSS, respectively. Cross-transmission rates with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter species and Enterobacter species were low: 5.7 and 4.5 per 1000 patient days at risk with any of these pathogens during CSS and OSS, respectively. The physiological consequences of CSS and OSS were investigated in an observational study nested within the crossover trial. Changes in heart rate and mean arterial pressure appeared minor and were comparable when using either CSS or OSS. Only changes in peripheral oxygen saturation appeared higher after using OSS as compared to CSS, but differences were very small (98.2% and 97.5%) and therefore clinically not relevant. In the UMC Utrecht, the price of using OSS was € 5 and of CSS €11,20 per patient per day (price level the Netherlands, 2009), and using OSS instead of CSS would save over €60,000 per year. Conclusion Based upon the results, both CSS and OSS can be considered equally safe in mechanically ventilated ICU patients. We could not demonstrate a difference in overall cross transmission, nor in overall acquisition of respiratory tract colonization. Furthermore, no clinically relevant differences in cardiorespiratory variables were found. The implications of the results for clinical practice are rather straightforward: the choice of the ES system to be used can be based on costs and personal preference.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Treatment and outcome of neonatal haemorrhagic brain injury In this thesis we have described the treatment and outcome of preterm infants with a severe intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) who subsequently developed post haemorrhagic ventricular dilatation (PHVD). In addition we described the treatment and outcome of term infants who suffered from an intracranial haemorrhage (ICH). There are considerable differences in the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to the preterm infant with PHVD as described in the results of a European survey about the diagnosis and treatment of PHVD. In preterms with PHVD, subcutaneous reservoirs are placed to remove cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). A subcutaneous reservoir is a safe and effective method to ensure controlled CSF removal. The incidence of infections of subcutaneous reservoirs in preterm infants was retrospectively studied. The incidence of an infection or major complications remains <5%, which we consider within acceptable limits. A pilot study was performed, to implement nurses’ performance of ventricular punctures. The successful change in policy means that punctures are now performed on schedule and nurses have more control in planning periods of rest for infants. The natural evolution of GMH-IVH was evaluated: the need for intervention for PHVD, and neurodevelopmental outcome at 24 months corrected age in 214 preterm infants (? 34 weeks GA). It was of interest to find that there was no significant difference in DQ at 24 months corrected age between infants who did or did not need intervention. We could only speculate about the positive role of early intervention. Neurodevelopmental and cognitive outcome in preterm infants at school age, who had a severe IVH (grade III or IV) and required neurosurgical intervention was studied. The majority (59.4%) had no neuroimpairments in the form of learning disabilities, cerebral palsy (CP) or epilepsy. Thirty-nine percent of this population had definite motor problems. The mean IQ of the total population was 93.4 and 29% of the children had an IQ <85 (-1SD). None of the children with a grade III hemorrhage developed CP. We speculate that this is due to early intervention, avoiding prolonged periods of raised intracranial pressure with periventricular oedema and distortion of the developing axonal pathways and disturbance of the myelination process. Neonatal and follow-up data of 53 full-term infants with ICH with associated parenchymal involvement admitted to a level 3 NICU over a period of 17 years were studied. ICH with parenchymal involvement carries a risk of adverse neurological sequelae with a mortality of 24.5% and a development of CP in 8.6%. The high mortality rate could partly be explained by associated perinatal asphyxia. In spite of often large intraparenchymal lesions, 88.2% of the survivors without CP had a normal early neurodevelopmental outcome. Promising results are reported in this thesis about short and long-term outcome of preterm infants who did develop PHVD. Especially for the preterm infants with a grade III haemorrhage. However, care of infants with an intracranial haemorrhage can be improved further, with regard to prevention and timing of intervention.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Chronic renal failure and end stage renal disease (ESRD) can be life-threatening conditions. In a significant number of cases with ESRD the primary cause l is a congenital anomaly of the kidney and/or urinary tract (CAKUT). Vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR) is the most common of the CAKUT spectrum. The studies in this thesis focus on isolated VUR. Although most children grow out of VUR without serious morbidity, a subset has associated complications. Together these account for 15% of ESRD in Dutch children. An autosomal dominant inheritance pattern with reduced penetrance is seen in some VUR families. Other segregation patterns have also been described, but for most cases a multifactorial etiology is most likely. Disruption of ureter budding in mouse embryos has been shown to lead to CAKUT. Genes involved in this budding process are therefore considered to be candidate genes for VUR susceptibility. The studies in this thesis were aimed at identifying genetic risk factors for VUR and/or CAKUT. Chapter 2 presents a literature study regarding the relationship between prenatally detected hydronephrosis (PNH) and postnatal VUR. In 15% of the patients with PNH primary VUR was detected, approximately 35% had other urogenital anomalies and in 50% postnatal examinations were normal. To explore whether we could provide clinical evidence for a new hypothesis on a contributory constitutional factor to VUR predisposition, and therefore on VUR genetics, we evaluated joint hypermobility in 50 VUR patients (chapter 3). The results of this study suggest that patients with hypermobile joints may have underlying systemic laxity that might in turn contribute to VUR. In chapters 4, 5 and 6 we investigated candidate genes in the ureter budding process for their role in VUR development with varied genetic approaches. We studied a syndromal patient with severe VUR who had a complex chromosomal aberration disturbing the ROBO2 gene. ROBO2 is a protein known to have a role in the ureter budding pathway. This led us to search for mutations in this gene in 124 VUR patients. Indeed mutations were detected in two familial cases. In four families we performed a linkage study, that focused on a subset of genes in the ureter budding process and other candidate regions. We could significantly exclude a role for the majority of genes under investigation. We performed an association study of common SNPs in 44 genes in the ureter budding pathway in > 400 Dutch VUR cases and > 1400 controls. None of the SNPs were significantly associated to VUR. Common SNPs in four ureter budding genes (GREM1, EYA1, ROBO2 and UPK3A) did show a trend towards association. In a subset of VUR patients with duplex collecting systems we identified 3 patients with mutations in UPK3A that possibly contribute to their phenotype. In chapter 7 we investigated patients with renal adysplasia, another part of the CAKUT spectrum. We investigated a gene known to be involved in renal adysplasia in other populations (UPK3A) and a new candidate gene (FGF7). We studied 19 patients and identified the first known stop-mutation in UPK3A.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Prion diseases, or transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), are invariably fatal neurodegenerative disorders that can be sporadic, inherited or acquired by infection. In humans, TSEs comprise three major groups showing a wide phenotypic heterogeneity: Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), Gerstmann-Str䵳sler-Scheinker (GSS) disease and fatal insomnia (FI). In The Netherlands, a national surveillance program was established in 1997 to monitor the incidence of both existing and emerging forms of prion diseases, in particular new variant CJD (vCJD), which is causally related to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle. The aim of the work described in this thesis is to describe the clinical, neuropathological, genetic and prion protein characteristics of all 162 patients with neuropathologically confirmed prion diseases in The Netherlands, diagnosed over a 12-year period (1998-2009). Since 1998, there has been a relatively stable incidence of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in The Netherlands, ranging from 0.63 to 1.53 per million inhabitants per annum. Genetic analysis of the codon 129 methionine/valine (M/V) polymorphism in the prion protein gene in all patients with sporadic CJD (sCJD) showed an over-representation of the MV genotype (22.4%) and an under-representation of VV (7.0%) cases, compared with sCJD cohorts in other Western countries. Combined biochemical and histopathological typing studies identified all sCJD subtypes known to, except for the VV1 subtype. In particular, a “pure” phenotype was demonstrated in 60.1% of patients, whereas a mixed phenotype was detected in 39.9% of all sCJD cases. The relative excess of MV cases was largely accounted for by a relatively high incidence of the MV 2K subtype. Genetic analysis of the prion protein gene (PRNP) was performed in 161 patients and showed a mutation in 9 of them (5.6%), including one familial FI and four GSS cases. Four mutations had not been described before, including two insertional mutations and two very rare nonsense mutations (Y226X and Q227X, the latter confirming that the absence of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor in the prion protein predisposes to amyloid plaque formation). Iatrogenic CJD was a rare phenomenon (3.1%), mainly associated with dura mater grafts. Three patients were diagnosed with vCJD (1.9%) and one with the recently described variably protease-sensitive prionopathy. Post-mortem examination revealed an alternative diagnosis in 156 patients, most commonly Alzheimer’s disease (21.2%) or vascular causes of dementia (19.9%). Many of these patients had been referred on the basis of a positive 14-3-3 protein assay in cerebrospinal fluid or because of electro-encephalogram findings suggestive of CJD, indicating that care must be taken in the interpretation of such ancillary investigations. The incidence and mortality rates of sCJD in The Netherlands are similar to those in other European countries, whereas iatrogenic and genetic cases are relatively rare. The unusual incidence of the MV 2K and VV2 sCJD subtypes deserves further investigation. The results of the studies presented in this thesis not only provide important epidemiological data for the Dutch population, but also add to an increasing body of knowledge with respect to molecular and genetic determinants of phenotypic variability in human prion diseases.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The pituitary gland produces and secretes follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) in a pulsatile fashion, induced by pulses of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus. Different cells in the ovary are capable of secreting estradiol, testosterone and progesterone, in response to LH and FSH. The ovarian hormones exhibit a feedback mechanism influencing the secretion of LH and FSH. The estrous cycle of the bitch is prevented most commonly by ovariectomy (OVX). Despite some potential side effects, most dog owners consider the procedure to be the method of choice for estrus prevention. The certainty of whether or not OVX has been performed in a bitch can be unclear when the animal has had previous owners or has been acquired from a shelter. Proving the presence of ovarian tissue in bitches is especially challenging during anestrus and consequently the use of GnRH in a provocation test of the pituitary-ovarian axis has been suggested. Therefore, the basal and GnRH-stimulated plasma concentrations of LH, FSH, estradiol, progesterone and testosterone were compared in anestrous and OVX bitches and data show that the mean basal plasma LH and FSH concentrations were significantly higher in OVX than anestrous bitches. Due to the pulsatile nature, overlap could occur in plasma LH concentration, but less likely in the plasma FSH concentration between both groups, indicating that a single measurement of the plasma FSH concentration is a reliable diagnostic tool to verify neuter status. GnRH administration resulted in a rise in the plasma estradiol concentration in both anoestrous and OVX bitches, while 120 min after GnRH administration no overlap existed between both groups. Differentiation between both groups with only a single basal plasma sample was best if the FSH to estradiol ratio was calculated. Also three important gynecological disorders in bitches were investigated. Remnant ovarian tissue (ROT) is due to incomplete surgical removal of one or both ovaries and can be very challenging to diagnose. Bitches with ROT had significantly higher basal plasma LH concentrations than anoestrous bitches and the concentration was higher in bitches in which estrus symptoms appeared for the first time more than 3 years after incomplete OVX. The basal plasma estradiol concentration was detectable in 17 of 18 bitches with ROT and in all 120 min after stimulation with GnRH. Granulosa cell tumors (GCTs) are the most frequently encountered hormone-producing ovarian tumors in middle-aged and older dogs, GCTs seem to appear more commonly in dogs with ROT. A high plasma LH concentration may play a role in the pathogenesis of GCTs. GCTs indeed seem to express functional gonadotropin receptors, since GnRH administration results in an increase of the plasma estradiol concentration. All dogs with a disorder in sexual development (DSD) described in this thesis had testicular tissue in their gonads and in three of them ovarian tissue was also present. The study revealed that the GnRH-stimulation test with measurement of plasma testosterone concentrations can be used to detect the presence of testicular tissue in dogs with DSD, while the plasma estradiol concentration is not informative about the presence or absence of ovarian tissue.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['The pathogenesis of lung emphysema: lessons learned from murine models'],\n",
       "  'Description': [\"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality throughout the world and is defined by the Global initiative in Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) as: “a disease state characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. The airflow limitation is both progressive and associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to noxious particles or gases”. COPD involves two spectra of clinical or pathological conditions, chronic bronchitis and lung emphysema and is associated with the accumulation and activation of several types of inflammatory cells in the lung tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). These activated inflammatory cells, but also structural cells in the respiratory tract release many inflammatory mediators, which are probably involved in the development of COPD. Cigarette smoking is by far the most important risk factor for COPD in more than 90% of the COPD patients. The experiments described in this thesis were performed to gain more knowledge about the mechanisms underlying cigarette smoke-induced lung emphysema and to search new compounds with a potential therapeutic activity. Several murine models of lung emphysema were used to mimic the pathological changes that are observed in COPD patients. The cascade of events leading to the development of lung emphysema will start with cigarette smoke exposure. Cigarette smoke exposure can stimulate epithelial cells, alveolar macrophages, neutrophils and B cells to release inflammatory mediators, including interleukin-8 (IL-8, CXCL8), adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) and immunoglobulin free light chains (IgLC). These mediators have the capacity to attract and/or activate neutrophils. Subsequently, activated neutrophils release CXCL8 and different proteases, such as matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-8 and MMP-9, which can proteolytically cleave collagen to smaller fragments resulting in an optimal substrate for the enzyme prolyl endopeptidase (PE). Various cell types, like neutrophils, macrophages and epithelial cells, express PE. These collagen fragments are then further cleaved to Proline-Glycine-Proline (PGP) by PE. Besides CXCL8, the generated PGP is also chemotactic for neutrophils and this results in an environment of chronic inflammation with proteolytic damage and ongoing PGP formation. Finally, this will lead to alveolar wall destruction (emphysema) and mucus hypersecretion (chronic bronchitis). Different possible treatment interventions were found to tackle the ongoing inflammation observed in COPD patients. First, a significantly decreased neutrophil influx in the BALF of smoke-exposed mice was observed after treatment with the IgLC antagonist, F991, the PE inhibitor, valproic acid (VPA) and the PGP antagonist, L-arginine-threonine-arginine (RTR). Secondly, the increased release of CXCL8 and elastase by ATP- or cigarette smoke extract-stimulated human neutrophils was inhibited by treatment with apyrase and suramin. Thirdly, CXCR2 antagonists inhibited the growth-related oncogene (GRO)-alpha (CXCL1)- and PGP-induced neutrophilic inflammation in the murine BALF and lung tissue. Although smoking cessation should be the first step in reducing the progression of lung emphysema, additional medication could be provided to tackle the sustained airway inflammation.\"],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The objective of this explorative study is to show that it is highly relevant to integrate cultural and personal body images into the ethical debate on human enhancement. The current debate has little attention for the motivations to make use of technology to alter the human body, such as cultural images of the human body. As a consequence, the debate risks to alienate from its central moral issue. Human enhancement is often understood as the technological interventions in the human body to improve human form and functioning without the medical indication to do so. An exploration of the different topics that receive attention in the ethical debate shows that there is no consensus about the core moral issues concerning enhancement. Within the debate, two interpretations of enhancement seem to be intertwined. One merely sees enhancement as the result of specific technologies. The other interpretation sees enhancement merely as a pursuit of (body) improvement. Especially when we understand enhancement as a pursuit of body improvement people’s motivations to alter themselves, their body images should be taken into consideration. One could even argue that enhancement, as the pursuit of improvement, is a cultural body image. Based on phenomenological, social scientist and feminist studies I display what I understand body images to be. Body images are cultural phenomena containing all attitudes and values concerning human bodies. These phenomena include the interrelationships between personal body images and cultural body images. Feminist and disability studies show us that body images are not merely contingent, but come into existence through cultural production. That statement introduces some interesting issues related to ethical deliberations. Two central issues are reflected upon. First, the complex relationship between body images and human action raises the question whether we can change or modify existing body images. The use of enhancement technologies itself implies that one can actively change ones body image. Is it also possible to alter pervasive cultural ideals of „normalcy?? On which levels are we able to act and on which are we not? Second, the notion of vulnerability is reflected upon. Do body images lead to vulnerability? Is vulnerability a moral issue? And finally, when do the vulnerabilities caused by the cultural production of body images evoke moral issues? A list of questions is presented that can be applied in concrete situations to inquire when body images lead to vulnerabilities that are morally problematic. This study detects the questions that need to be raised in order to understand to what extent the investigated connection between body images and enhancement raises issues of moral responsibility. The problem is that the cultural production of body images is a complex process. It is not possible to appoint one single responsible actor. How could we reflect upon moral responsibility in such a complex situation? Which issues of moral responsibility in relation to body images should be dealt with within the context of enhancement? A society that wishes to act responsibly in relation to enhancement technologies needs to reflect upon those questions.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Assessment of current and future ovarian reserve status'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Ovarian ageing is the gradual decline in the number of oocytes and the simultaneous decrease of the quality of the remaining oocytes. The changes in quantity and quality will lead to four milestones in the reproductive lifespan: subfertility, the end of natural fertility, menopausal transition and menopause. It is hypothesized that a fixed interval exists between these milestones, with the end of natural fertility occurring 10 years before menopause. The normal process of ovarian ageing varies considerably among women, with an age range of about 20 years. Therefore, accurate prediction of the current and future fertility status is desirable. This thesis evaluates the true value of ovarian reserve tests (ORTs) in the assessment of the current fertility status in assisted reproduction treatment (ART) as well as their potential in forecasting future fertility status. For the prediction of the current fertility status we evaluated the available evidence through both conventional and individual patient data meta-analysis. For the quantitative aspect of the current fertility status status, it could be demonstrated that the ORTs AFC and AMH are highly capable of predicting the ovarian response to hyperstimulation, and that the predictive ability is age independent. For the prediction of an ongoing pregnancy ovarian reserve tests demonstrated a poor accuracy and did not add to the limited predictive capacity of female age. Also, no clinical subgroup could be identified in which the performance of one of the ovarian reserve tests clearly is improved to a level at which correct prediction of pregnancy would become possible. This emphasizes that assessment of the quality aspect of ovarian reserve remains troublesome. Based on these findings, the clinical value of ovarian reserve tests will depend on the implications for management of predicting a poor or excessive response to ovarian hyperstimulation. Current literature suggests possibilities especially for dosage reduction in predicted excessive responders, while prediction of poor response may help in timely decisions on refraining from further ART treatment. For the prediction of the future ovarian reserve status, a long term follow up study was performed in normo-ovulatory women, with assessment of menopausal status 12 years after initial evaluation of ovarian reserve status. A nomogram of age specific AMH values could be constructed, from which it appeared that the normal distribution of age at menopause will shift considerably depending on the age specific AMH value. This implies that by correct prediction of the age range of menopause, individual assessment of the reproductive lifespan may become possible. From there, avenues for primary prevention of age related infertility and menopause related conditions may open'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Main conclusions from this thesis Part I Esophagus Benign esophageal ruptures or leaks - Covered stents placed for a period of 6 weeks are effective and safe. Stent choice should to a large extent depend on expected risks of stent migration, particularly when SEPS and FSEMS are used, and tissue in- or overgrowth, particularly with PSEMS, since efficacy rates between PSEMS, FSEMS and SEPS was not found to be very much different. Refractory benign esophageal strictures - Both temporary SEPS (for a period of 6 weeks) and BD stent placement achieve long-term relief without a further need for dilation in 30% and 33% of patients, respectively. Placement of BD stents has the advantage that fewer endoscopic reinterventions are required, the latter mainly being performed for stent removal. Malignant esophageal strictures - The partially covered Evolution stent (Cook Medical, Limerick, Ireland) is safe and effective for palliation of dysphagia from esophageal and gastric cardia cancer. -The partially covered Wallflex stent (Boston Scientific, Natick, MA., USA) is also a safe and effective stent for palliation of malignant dysphagia. However, retrosternal pain seemed to occur more often with this stent design as compared to other designs. Based on this, we recommend not to place this stent in patients who previously have undergone radiation and/or chemotherapy for esophageal cancer as these patients are known to be at an increased risk of post-procedural retrosternal pain. Part II Biliary tract Benign distal biliary strictures -Based on clinical success (re-establishment of biliary patency) and risk of complications (e.g. cholangitis, pancreatitis and stent migration) placement of multiple plastic stents is currently the best choice for the endoscopic treatment of a benign distal biliary stricture. Malignant inoperable distal biliary strictures -Both uSEMS and cSEMS have a longer patency than plastic stents, but the number of reinterventions is lowest after placement of uSEMS. -Based on a model, we propose that the subgroup of patients with a tight malignant biliary stricture requiring preceding dilation and/or a high initial bilirubin level, with an expected survival longer than 14 weeks should be treated with an uSEMS to reduce the risk of stent occlusion. In the remaining patients, placement of a plastic stent should be considered, again depending on the patients’ expected survival'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Delirium is defined as a disturbance of consciousness with cognitive changes or perceptual disturbances, which has developed over a short period of time, and is caused by a medical condition or a post-surgical state. Although historically dismissed as an inconvenient and transient problem, recent studies have reported that delirium is associated with more complications, increased length of hospital stay and higher mortality. Although delirium is a prevalent condition in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), the condition appears to be largely under diagnosed and treated. In this thesis, the diagnostic instruments and methods for screening for delirium in ICU patients available are discussed. The authors have evaluated the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) and compared the results with groups of experts. Although the CAM-ICU is relatively easy to implement in daily practice and in use, the test characteristics of the CAM-ICU, when compared to experts, are moderate at best. As part of this thesis, the authors studied the effect of implementation of standardized delirium screening with the CAM-ICU on anti-delirium medication use, no significant differences were found. It is often hypothesized that delirium in critically ill patients is – in part - caused by the ICU environment (noise, light et cetera). To study the effect of different ICU environments, the authors have registered the effect of single versus multiple patient room ICUs on the frequency and duration of delirium and sleep. Although no significant beneficial effect on sleep and the frequency of delirium was found, patients in single room ICU’s had a shorter delirium than those in multiple patient rooms. In the final part of this thesis, the authors investigated a possible new delirium treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors (rivastigmine). The authors designed and conducted a randomized, placebo controlled trial to study the effect of rivastigmine when added to the standard delirium treatment in critically ill patients. This trial was stopped early and no beneficial effect of rivastigmine on duration or severity of delirium was found. The author concludes this thesis with two conclusions: firstly, the available screening methods for delirium in critically ill patients do not suffice. Furthermore, the necessity of delirium screening in the ICU is doubtful. Secondly, further research should focus on preventive – nursing – measures and not on pharmacological treatment.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The aim of this dissertation was to provide a systematic exploration of the nature and distribution of dysfunctional affect regulation, its associated phenomena, and retrospectively reported potentially traumatizing events in 475 patients diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (BPD), somatoform disorder (SoD), comorbid BPD+SoD, and a psychiatric comparison group (PC) to provide a baseline against which to compare the hypothesized elevations in dysfunctional self and affect regulation. Whereas some patients react to adversities with inhibited experiencing and social withdrawal, others react hyper-emotionally and tend to cling to a significant other to alleviate stress and regulate to base-line. Van Dijke described dysfunctional self and affect regulation as operating in vicious cycles that approach the long-term sequelae of trauma-by-primary-caretaker from a developmental perspective. Activation of dysfunctional regulation seems to follow trauma-by-primary-caretaker associated negatively biased cognitive-emotional information processing. However, when potentially neutral situations are processed and evaluated as threatening or potentially harmful, dysfunctional regulation is activated false positively. Consequently, this may result in interpersonal misunderstanding and disappointments, which in turn condition and uphold the insecure attachment representation/ working models eventually turning into dysfunctional regulation vicious circles. The present studies demonstrated that dysfunctional regulation presents in patients in three qualitatively different forms: Inhibitory-, Excitatory-, and combined Inhibitory & Excitatory (IE)-regulation. Symptoms include disturbances in self-regulation across several domains of functioning including affective, cognitive, somatic, relational, reflective, executive, behavioral, and psycho-physiological functioning. However, no disorder-specific form of dysfunctional affect regulation or dissociation was found. Adults who were exposed to potentially traumatizing events by primary caretaker during childhood often demonstrate complex psychological disturbances that are not fully captured by the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) diagnosis. In an attempt to capture the complex symptom presentation that includes not only posttraumatic stress symptoms, but also other symptoms reflecting disturbances predominantly in affective and interpersonal self-regulatory capacities, dissociation, somatization, and shattered or altered basic beliefs, Complex PTSD (CPTSD) was introduced as a clinical syndrome for adults. This disorder fundamentally involves the focus of this study: Dysfunctional affect regulation and dissociation. Childhood trauma-primary-caretaker plays a role in both over- and under-regulation of affect depending on the type and developmental epoch of the traumatization in psychiatrically-impaired adults, specifically in BPD. Also, CPTSD can be distinguished from BPD and/or SoD. By including patients of both genders and other diagnoses as well as BPD, the present study demonstrated that CPTSD is not exclusively or always found with (and therefore not synonymous with) BPD. The combined results of this dissertation suggest that further clinical and research studies are needed in order to further the development of empirically-based clinical assessment and treatment protocols for trauma-related self and affect dysregulation in adults with a range of Axis I and II psychiatric disorders. Also, disorder-specific assessment and treatment methods and guidelines for BPD, SoD and severe affective, and anxiety, may be enhanced by the addition of approaches focused on the types of dysfunctional affect- and self regulation that were identified and examined in the present studies.'],\n",

The thesis starts with a short review of the current knowledge on the effects of classic cardiovascular risk factors for atherosclerosis on collateral artery growth.

Furthermore, we focus on improving the translation of experimental data from bench to bedside: we investigate the effects of aging on arteriogenesis and we present a new porcine model for coronary collateral artery growth.

       "  'Description': ['Sarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory disorder that is characterized by granuloma formation in different organs. Sarcoidosis patients frequently report fatigue. Even when the clinical symptoms of the inflammatory disease sarcoidosis have resolved, chronic fatigue may persist. In this study 75 patients with sarcoidosis in clinical remission were evaluated. Median time since diagnosis was 9 years (interquartile range 5 – 17). Chronic fatigue was present in 49% of patients. The fatigued patients reported significantly more pain points, lower scores on health status, higher levels of psychological distress, higher scores the personality trait Harm-Avoidance, a higher percentage of days awaking unrefreshed, and lower scores on muscle strength tests (respiratory muscles, handgrip and quadriceps) than the non-fatigued patients. Criteria for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome were met in 47% of fatigued cases. Compared to normscores, fatigued patients showed significantly reduced physical activity levels as measured with an accelerometer.\\r\\n\\r\\nImmunologically, - after in vitro stimulation of supernatants of whole blood cultures – a complex of T cell produced cytokines/chemokines was identified which consisted of interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5 and IL-10. This so called Th2-complex was negatively associated with chronic fatigue. In addition, in fatigued patients in vitro production of monocyte-derived IL-8 was higher while plasma levels of MCP-1 was lower compared to non-fatigued patients. This observation led to the hypothesis that fatigued patients had been sensitized by the immense inflammation during the active phase of sarcoidosis. This sensitization of the neuronal system together with the reduced capability to produce Th2 cytokines (this Th2 response is necessary to restore the immune balance) contributes to the persistence of chronic fatigue, even after the clinical signs of disease activity have resolved.\\r\\n\\r\\nFurthermore, in response to acute psychosocial stress (Trier Social Stress Test) fatigued patients released less epinephrine than non-fatigued patients. Fatigued female patients also tended to have overall lower blood pressure levels compared to non-fatigued females.\\r\\nMoreover, compared to controls AUC’s and N2P2-amplitudes of EEG recorded Laser Evoked Potentials of the study group were decreased while N2- and P2-latencies were normal. This points to reduced nociception via small Aδ-fibers, without damage of the myeline layer that surrounds the fibers. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt one year follow up in 50% of the study cohort reported chronic fatigue. Multiple regression analysis revealed that the cytokine/chemokine profile and psychoneurotic distress were significant predictors of fatigue severity as measured at follow up.\\r\\nAs chronic post-inflammatory fatigue is a severe problem which persists over many years, accurate treatment is of the utmost importance. Therefore, we recommend a trial to assess the usefulness of cognitive behavior therapy (in order to alleviate psychological symptoms) in combination with graded exercise therapy (so as to enhance physical activity levels and muscle force, but also to stimulate sympathetic output and epinephrine secretion, which subsequently enhances Th2 cytokine production) in a group of chronically fatigued sarcoidosis patients in clinical remission.'],\n",

The aim of the second part is to investigate the effect of medical interventions (gastric acid inhibition, ursodeoxycholic acid and energy intake) on growth, bacterial colonization and pulmonary function. In chapter 2 the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition CF working Group definitions for DIOS and constipation in CF are described. Subsequently, in chapter 3 the incidence, prevalence and risk factors of constipation in the pediatric CF population of the UMC Utrecht were determined. Constipation is frequently seen in Cystic Fibrosis, as 47% of all CF patients experienced at least one episode of constipation. Furthermore, constipation was associated with fat malabsorption and meconium ileus. Chapter 4 describes the association between the p.S357N variant in the CLCA 1 gene and meconium ileus in a cohort of European (Dutch, German and Italian) pediatric CF patients. In chapter 5 we report that gastric acid inhibition for fat malabsorption is safe to use in CF patients as gastric acid inhibition for fat malabsorption does not affect bacterial colonization and might even have an advantageous effect on the decline in pulmonary function. However gastro-esophageal reflux disease was associated with a worse pulmonary function and earlier first infection with P. Aeruginosa and S. Aureus. In chapter 6 we showed that ursodeoxycholic acid was longitudinally associated with worse fat absorption, growth and pulmonary function.

       "  'Title': ['Arterial spin labeling perfusion MRI in cerebral ischaemia'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Cerebral perfusion is the basis for the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the brain. Brain tissue can become damaged when there is a shortage in the blood supply. Basic physiological functions such as synaptic transmission, the membrane ion pump and energy metabolism are disrupted and within minutes can lead to irreversible damage and neurological symptoms. The aim of this thesis was to investigate the ability of arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI to measure cerebral perfusion in patients with acute stroke and symptomatic large vessel disease of the brain feeding arteries. ASL perfusion imaging is an alternative non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique for visualizing brain perfusion and quantifying cerebral blood flow that does not require injection of contrast agents. The blood flowing into the brain is used as an endogenous contrast agent by magnetically labeling the inflowing blood with radiofrequency pulses. This thesis consists of two parts. The first part focuses on the application of different ASL-MRI techniques to assess brain perfusion. In patients with acute stroke it is shown that ASL can detect perfusion deficits and perfusion-diffusion mismatch prior to treatment comparable to gadolinium based DSC perfusion imaging (chapter 2). By acquiring a series of perfusion-weighted images at increasing delay times after the initial labeling, ASL is able to measure the inflow of blood into the brain. Although, when compared to H215O PET there was a relative systematic overestimation of cerebral blood flow (chapter 3), ASL can depict the presence and extent of regions with hypoperfusion and increased transit times in patients with carotid artery disease (chapter 4 and 5). The second part of this thesis focuses on assessing the cerebrovascular reactivity by combining ASL perfusion imaging with a vascular challenge. This is a measure of the brain’s capacity to sustain blood flow when perfusion pressure drops. Impairment is associated with increased stroke occurrence. Cerebrovascular reactivity is impaired in patients with a carotid artery stenosis on the side of the stenosis (chapter 6). By using a selective ASL technique that can visualize the flow territories of the brain feeding arteries, it was shown that cerebrovascular reactivity impairment varies throughout the brain (chapter7). Tissue areas fed via collaterals are the most impaired. Both large vessel disease and the occurrence of white matter lesions were furthermore found to have an effect upon white matter hemodynamics (chapter 8).

       "  'Title': ['Targeting solid tumors : advances in treatment strategies for glioma and colorectal cancer'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Curative treatment of most solid tumors includes surgical interference. However, the incidence of local recurrence or distant micrometastases is significantly lower when patients are treated with systemic or locally administered chemo- or targeted therapy. In the last decade, many novel targeting strategies have been developed for several tumor types. This thesis aims to identify promising targeting strategies for glioma and colorectal carcinoma and reveals resistance mechanisms for these new promising strategies. In the first part, the therapeutic effects of oncolytic viral vectors on glioma and colorectal cancer are explored. Infectivity and cell killing properties of transductional and transcriptional targeted adenoviral vectors is evaluated on glioma cell lines and freshly derived glioma tissue from patients. In this part, a very selective, conditionally replicating adenovirus based on the survivin promoter is presented for the treatment of glioma. In colon cancer samples, this thesis describes efforts to overcome infectivity limitations observed in reovirus treatment of primary colorectal cancer samples. In the second part, we evaluate EGFR and MEK targeting in KRAS mutated colorectal cancer cells. For EGFR, we focus on the effects of KRAS mutations on EGFR signaling and inhibition. In line with the growing evidence in large clinical studies, we find that both extracellular and intracellular EGFR targeting agents are ineffective in colorectal cancer cells with an activating mutation in KRAS. In search for explanations for this striking resistance, we show that mutant KRAS causes intracellular retention of the EGFR which diminishes the tumor cell response to both EGF induced activation and EGFR inhibition. These results add an alternative explanation for resistance to EGFR targeted therapy. For MEK targeting, we demonstrate that mutant KRAS allows cells to bypass MEK/ERK inhibition by activating the p38 MAPKinase pathway. This allows activation of transcriptional targets that are shared by the MEK/ERK and the p38 MAPK pathway. Therefore, we state that KRAS mutations in colon cancer cells are associated with resistance to MEK inhibition. Finally, we explore strategies to target colorectal cancer stem cells. Therefore, a novel model for culturing colorectal cancer stem cells from freshly resected colorectal tumors or liver metastases was developed. With this model, we identify two different mechanisms of resistance of cancer stem cells to common chemotherapeutic drugs. First, we show that one of the ABC transporters, ABCB1, plays an important role in resistance to irinotecan treatment. However, our results indicate that colorectal cancer stem cells do not display intrinsic resistance to irinotecan. Instead, the drug-sensitive cancer stem cells appear to be protected by a drug resistant, differentiated cell population originating from the cancer stem cells. Second, we used a proteomics based approach to identify BIRC6, an inhibitor of apoptosis protein, as a key player in resistance of cancer stem cells to oxaliplatin and cisplatin resistance in cancer stem cells. In conclusion, we describe several new targeting strategies for glioma and colorectal cancer. Our studies identify some striking resistance pattern for targeted therpeutics, but also suggest strategies for circumventing resistance and reveal new options for tumor targeting'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The global estimated annual numbers of non-severe and severe (i.e. hospitalized) respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections in children younger than five are 34 and 3.4 million. Most children with RSV bronchiolitis are treated outside the hospital and most children with RSV bronchiolitis are healthy term infants. This thesis is based on the Netherlands Amniotic Fluid Cohort, which was initiated to gain insight in the etiology of RSV bronchiolitis and to contribute to its prediction in healthy term infants. We found the following predictive factors for RSV bronchiolitis in healthy term infants: presence of siblings / day-care attendance, birth in April to September, birth weight >4 kg, and highly educated parents. Abundant viral exposure (i.e. siblings, day-care) appeared to be the strongest predictor of RSV bronchiolitis in healthy term infants. The derived prediction rule could differentiate between children with low risk (3%) of RSV bronchiolitis and high risk (32%). Children with RSV bronchiolitis had an increased prevalence of recurrent wheezing and reduced health-related quality of life during the first year of life. In addition, vitamin D deficiency at birth was also associated with an increased risk of RSV bronchiolitis. RSV viral load was positively associated with disease severity in primary RSV infections. A high correlation with RSV viral load was found for single RSV infections and for RSV co-infections. In line with these findings, the sensitivity of the nasal swab for the molecular detection of RSV infection in the community was generally moderate, but high in case of more severe RSV infection. Term spontaneous onset of labor vaginal delivery was associated with high levels amniotic fluid pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α) and a high prevalence of histological chorioamnionitis. Fetal exposure to higher levels of amniotic fluid pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-8, TNF-α) appeared to be associated with a decreased risk of medically attended RSV bronchiolitis in the first year of life. In addition, in the group of children that developed RSV bronchiolitis, the number of days with wheezing symptoms in the first year of life was inversely associated with the amniotic fluid concentration of IL-8. Finally, newborn airway compliance was positively correlated with the amniotic fluid concentration of sLAIR-1, which is considered a marker of general immune activation. Additionally, children exposed to a high level of amniotic fluid sLAIR-1 had a decreased incidence of recurrent wheezing. Given the finding that a firm pro-inflammatory profile was present in amniotic fluid of the majority of physiologic term deliveries, one could speculate on the role of exposure of the fetal mucosa to these inflammatory signals. Maybe these signals instruct the local mucosal immune system to prepare for the invasions of several pathogens, allergens and pollutants after birth. Since the impressive inflammatory response is present during term deliveries on such a large scale, it is likely that the beneficial effect found is not specific for RSV bronchiolitis, but also holds true for other childhood respiratory condition, such as viral-induced wheezing and asthma. Maybe the origin of common human respiratory disorders should be sought antenatally'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['In the past decades, the worldwide number of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) has increased remarkably and it is expected that this increasing trend will continue during the coming years (1). At this moment, therapy is focused on the prevention of progressive CKD by treatment of the underlying causes, such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity. CKD is asymptomatic in the initial stage and is often diagnosed in a stage at which treatment of the underlying cause alone is not sufficient to stop loss of kidney function. As a consequence, CKD will gradually progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and renal dialysis or kidney transplantation are then the only possibilities for patients to survive. Because of the lack of clinically available drugs that can halt the progression of CKD and the seriousness of the disease, there is a high need for novel drugs. This thesis focuses on the intracellular delivery of drugs into the proximal tubular cells of the kidneys. Tubulointerstitial fibrosis is one of the common hallmarks of progressive CKD and renal drug targeting to the proximal tubular cells can be of great value in the development of therapeutics that halt or reverse tubulointerstitial fibrosis.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Diagnostic accuracy research is a vital step in the evaluation of new diagnostic technologies. It is the ability of a test to correctly discriminate between patients that have and do not have the target disease. In studies of diagnostic accuracy, results of the tests under study are compared with results of a reference standard applied to the same patients. In this research framework, the reference standard is the best available method to verify the presence or absence of the target disease, and thus provides the final classification of patients into target disease present or absent. This process is known as disease verification. Ideally, the reference standard provides error-free disease classification. In some situations, it is not possible to verify the disease outcome with the preferred reference standard in all patients or any patient at all. Failure to apply the reference standard may result in various types of disease verification problems. Biased and exaggerated estimates of accuracy of a test can lead to inefficiencies in testing in clinical practice, unnecessary costs, and could trigger physicians to making incorrect treatment decisions. This thesis examines the problem of verification bias in studies of diagnostic accuracy. In particular, we aimed to investigate the available methods to alleviate the various problems of verification bias and, more importantly, to improve the methodology and analysis of primary diagnostic accuracy studies and diagnostic meta-analyses in the presence of various forms of verification bias.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['A defect in coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) results in the inherited bleeding disorder hemophilia A. Current treatment of hemophilia A is hampered by the need of frequent administration of costly FVIII products. Therefore gene therapy is an attractive alternative for protein replacement to treat hemophilia A patients. Recent insights have suggested that it may be beneficial to express FVIII in cells that also secrete its natural carrier protein von Willebrand factor (VWF), i.e. platelets and endothelial cells. In this thesis our aim was to explore the potential of endothelial cells as a cellular release-on-demand device for co-delivery of FVIII and VWF. We demonstrate that blood outgrowth endothelial cells (BOECs) transduced with a lentiviral vector encoding FVIII are capable of long-term production of high FVIII levels. A substantial part of FVIII synthesized by BOECs is stored with VWF in storages organelles called Weibel-Palade bodies (WPBs), and can be released upon stimulation of WPB exocytosis. Using confocal microscopy we observed that the appearance of FVIII-containing WPBs was round as opposed to the typical elongated shape of normal WPBs. We found that FVIII expression prohibits the formation of long VWF tubules that normally determine the elongated shape of WPBs. In addition, our data suggest that an intracellular interaction of FVIII with VWF impairs recruitment of platelets by VWF released from WPBs. The effect of FVIII expression on VWF stored in WPBs implies that FVIII and VWF associate with each other inside WPBs. Therefore we studied whether or not WPB-derived FVIII and VWF remain associated after release from WPBs. We found that FVIII co-stored with VWF in WPBs binds to secreted VWF strings without a need of the extracellular high-affinity VWF binding site Y1680. Our data further suggest that intracellular and extracellular FVIII-VWF complex assembly differ with regard to the contribution of the Y1680 residue in VWF binding. We also determined the role of VWF for storage of FVIII in WPBs by studying the sorting ability of FVIII variants displaying reduced VWF interaction. We found that FVIII sorting to WPBs is not affected by a reduced extracellular FVIII-VWF interaction. Moreover, using domain deletion mutants and FVIII-FV chimeras, we demonstrate that FVIII sorting to WPBs is driven by FVIII-specific structural elements in both C domains. In conclusion, BOECs comprise a promising cell type as these cells synthesize and store considerable quantities of FVIII with VWF in WPBs. Furthermore, FVIII is probably released from WPBs in complex with VWF as exocytosis of WPB content under flow results in strong association of FVIII with VWF strings.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['A mechanistic insight into MDMA-mediated hepatotoxicity'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, Ecstasy) is a popular drug of abuse among young people that can induce adverse effects. However, these effects lack a specific pattern, as consumption quantities are not correlated with the initiation and severity of the injury. MDMA can cause drug-induced liver injury (DILI). Two suggested pathways that play a role in the onset of DILI are direct hepatotoxicity due to toxic metabolites and adverse immune responses. Therefore, we studied MDMA interactions with phase I and II enzymes and the possible alteration of immune events in several in vitro systems (human liver (THLE) cells transfected with individual CYP450, rat liver microsomes, human PXR-mediated CYP3A4-reporter gene assay, rat primary hepatocytes, HepG2, THP-1 and PBMC). Our data suggests that not only CYP2D6 but also CYP3A4 plays an important role in MDMA bioactivation. Furthermore,MDMA alone or in combination with other therapeutic drugs inhibited CYP3A catalytic activity. This appeared to be due to decreased activation of its main regulator pregnane X receptor (PXR) which subsequently decreases CYP3A gene expression. Therefore, MDMA use in combination with other (therapeutic) drugs could induce adverse drug-drug interactions through interactions with PXR and/or CYP3A. Following metabolism by phase II enzymes, interactions between MDMA/HHMA (a toxic MDMA metabolite) and the glutathione system were observed. HHMA significantly decreased cell viability and depleted GSH levels, resulting in an increased expression of glutamate cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST). Upon MDMA exposure GSH levels and GCLC expression were not significantly affected, although GST expression was increased. Moreover, we evaluated the potential protective effects of two antioxidants, N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) and sulforaphane (SFN). NAC counteracted MDMA-induced cytotoxicity and restored GSH levels. Phase II enzyme expression was also reverted. Conversely, SFN increased MDMA-induced cytotoxicity, GSH depletion, GCLC and GST expression. The differential behavior of both antioxidants indicates that care should be taken when using them during treatment of MDMA intoxications, since NAC could very rapidly restore GSH levels, while SFN lacks this effect.Finally, we investigated the role of the immune system on MDMA-mediated liver injury using liver and immune cells in a co-culture model. A protection (HepG2/THP-1) versus impairment (HepG2/PBMC) of MDMA-induced HepG2 cell viability was observed. In THP-1 cells, TNF‑α expression was moderately decreased and IL-8 expression was increased. In the HepG2/PBMC model, MDMA exposure reduced TNF-α and IL-8 but increased IL-10 gene expression, comparable with effects observed in MDMA users. These data suggests that the HepG2/PBMC model is useful to study drug-induced liver toxicity. Using this model, we have shown that immunosuppression appeared to be partially mediated by antagonistic effects of MDMA on peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPARα) in HepG2 cells. Taken together, MDMA interactions with metabolizing enzymes and the nuclear receptors that regulate them may alter the metabolic pattern of individuals. This should be taken into account when searching for a clinical treatment to counteract MDMA-mediated side effects. Furthermore, MDMA may cause a greater susceptibility to infectious diseases through a reduction of pro-inflammatory events.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Pharmaceutical peptides/proteins have proven to be potent molecules for the treatment of a great variety of chronic and life threatening diseases. These molecules however demand a suitable formulation for their successful delivery. For formulation and delivery of such molecules the parenteral route is the preferred one, as other routes of administration (e.g. oral, rectal, lung) have been shown to be inefficient. Another characteristic of many peptides and proteins is that they have a short plasma and tissue half live. This leads to frequent injection schemes to maintain a therapeutic drug level. Consequently, sustained release systems would lead to less frequent injections and an improved pharmacokinetic profile as the blood and tissue levels will show fewer fluctuations over time. The development of a new family of biodegradable polymer-based sustained release systems for injection is the subject of this thesis. The encapsulation and release of macromolecular hydrophilic Dextran Blue as well as peptide/proteins (e.g. lysozyme, BSA and octreotide) from poly(lactic-co-hydroxymethyl glycolic acid) (PLHMGA) microspheres was investigated and results were compared to the data obtained for PLGA microspheres. Microspheres can be successfully made from PLHMGA, by the double emulsion extraction-evaporation method. The in vitro release study showed that the release is governed by the degradation of the microspheres. The structural integrity of the released peptide/protein was investigated with FTIR, HPLC, SEC, CD and Fluorescence. The results demonstrated that the structural and functional integrity of the released peptide/protein was preserved. One of the major challenges with PLGA microspheres is prevention of the drop of pH inside degrading microspheres which is detrimental for the integrity of acid labile molecules such as peptides and proteins. The microclimate pH (μpH) of degrading PLHMGA microspheres was studied and the results were compared with that of PLGA. PLHMGA microspheres prepared from copolymers with different copolymer composition did not show changes in pH during incubation. As the degradation of the microspheres progressed, the acid degradation products (lactic and hydroxymethyl glycolic acid and their oligomers) which are responsible for pH drop, were released into the degradation medium as was confirmed by a decrease in pH of the surrounding medium. On the contrary, confocal images of PLGA microspheres during incubation showed that these microspheres developed a low pH during degradation. This means that the formed acid degradation products were not released in the medium as also evidenced from the observation that the pH of the degradation medium remained constant at 7.4. In conclusion, this thesis describes the application of novel biodegradable microspheres made from a hydrophilic polyester, poly(D,L-lactide-co-hydroxymethyl glycolide) (PLHMGA) for controlled delivery of peptide and protein pharmaceuticals. PLHMGA microspheres showed superior properties over their PLGA counterpart, a FDA approved polymer, regarding the control over degradation and release rate. The release of biopharmaceuticals and degradation of the microspheres could be successfully tailored by synthesis of copolymers differing in copolymer composition. The results reported in this thesis highlight the great potential of PLHMGA microspheres for biopharmaceutical applications.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Intestinal cancer research has focussed on understanding the process of tumour formation for which hereditary disorders have proven to be valuable models. Although much is known about the genetic events that occur during the adenoma-carcinoma sequence, little is known about the genetic events that take place before the visible histopathological changes, a process called pre-tumour progression. This is mainly because many mutations are compatible with a histologically normal phenotype which allows adenomas, in general, to appear relatively late in life after the age of 50. Expanding knowledge of (pre) tumour progression in Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP), Juvenile Polyposis (JPS) and Peutz-Jeghers (PJS) syndrome patients allows an increased understanding of cancer development as a whole and to potentially predict an individuals’ susceptibility to tumour development. Our research provides evidence for the presence of pre-tumour progression in FAP patients; FAP patients reveal an increase in methylation patterns diversity which can be used as a read-out for enhanced stem cell longevity. Since intestinal cancer seems to be a disease of the stem cell, altered stem cell dynamics is essential in cancer development. As such, an increase in survival allows stem cells to have more time to accumulate the mutations required to initiate tumour formation. The increase in stem cell longevity seems to be caused by an imbalance in stem cell division due to the APC germline mutation carried by FAP patients. Interestingly, similar results are found in PJS patients; PJS also reveals enhanced stem cell survival, possibly due to the LKB1 germline mutation which they carry. JPS patients carry a SMAD4 or a BMPR1A germline mutation; we have been able to provide evidence that different genotypes result in different phenotypes. Polyps with a predominant stromal compartment are found in BMPR1Amutation carriers, while a more epithelial polyp variant is found in SMAD4 mutation carriers. Interestingly, when determining methylation pattern diversity to be able to establish the presence or absence of pre-tumour progression, BMPR1A mutation carriers reveal enhanced stem cell longevity and an expansion of the stem cell pool while in SMAD4 mutation carriers, hyperproliferation is seen. Both result in tumourigenesis but along different routes. Interestingly, literature has shown SMAD4 mutations to play a central role in the adenoma-carcinoma sequence suggesting that JPS SMAD4 mutation carriers develop tumours through the conventional adenoma-carcinoma sequence. However, by conducting APC, SMAD4 and K-ras mutation analysis and p53, SMAD4 and β-catenin immunohistochemistry, we have been able to contradict this theory. In conclusion, our research has provided evidence that multiple pathways lead to neoplasia in polyposis syndrome patients where aberrant stem cell dynamics seems to play an essential role.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Dry bubble disease is a persistent problem in the cultivation of the white button mushroom, A. bisporus. There is a pressing need for innovative ways to control spread and development of L. fungicola in mushroom cultivation as currently disease management relies heavily on one chemical (Sporgon) for which a reduced sensitivity of the pathogen has been reported. The research described in this thesis aims to supply targets for such innovative ways. In order to develop effective control of L. fungicola, a thorough understanding of its ecology is crucial. Therefore in chapter 2, current knowledge about this mycopathogen is reviewed. The ecology of the pathogen is discussed with emphasis on host range, dispersal and primary source of infection. In addition, insights in the infection process and mushroom defense mechanisms are reviewed. In chapter 3, the ecology of L. fungicola in the casing is investigated. It was found that Lecanicillium spores remain dormant until A. bisporus colonizes the casing. It was shown that the casing microflora is involved in this dormancy and mechanisms were investigated. It appears that the casing microflora produce antifungal compounds that impose a nutrient dependency on L. fungicola spores that otherwise germinate independent of nutrients. Chapter 4 describes the search for antagonists that effectively suppress dry bubble disease. Possible mechanisms of antagonisms towards L. fungicola were investigated in vitro using well characterized Pseudomonas strains. Subsequently, a collection of bacteria that were isolated from colonized casing was screened for in vitro antagonism. In vitro, L. fungicola was inhibited by certain isolates through competition for iron and antibiosis. However, these isolates could not effectively suppress dry bubble disease. We conclude that biological control of dry bubble disease is not feasible. Control of plant pathogens often functions not only through direct antagonism of the biocontrol agent on the pathogen, but also through induction of systemic resistance in plants. Induced resistance in both plants and animals is mostly triggered upon pathogenic attack. As both plants and animals have developed functionally similar systems of induced defence, it was hypothesized that fungi too could have evolved mechanisms to respond systemically upon microbial attack. In chapter 5, however, it is shown that mushrooms of A. bisporus do not exhibit induced systemic resistance upon attack by L. fungicola. In chapter 6 application of 1-octen-3-ol to control dry bubble disease is investigated. 1-octen-3-ol is produced by A. bisporus and a principle component of the mushroom’s aroma. It was found that 1-octen-3-ol treatment reduced dry bubble disease in inoculated mushroom cultures. Under conditions that resembled the commercial production of mushrooms, 1-octen-3-ol was as effective as Sporgon. This demonstrates that 1-octen-3-ol has potential for disease management in the mushroom industry. Furthermore, preliminary results indicate that other plant pathogenic fungi are also sensitive to 1-octen-3-ol, which broadens the opportunities for 1-octen-3-ol’s application. Finally, in chapter 7, the results described in this thesis are discussed in view of possibilities to control dry bubble disease.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The development of chronic allograft rejection after lung transplantation (LTx) is the most common cause of poor long-term survival in lung transplant recipients. This rejection leads to obliteration of the bronchioli. Since this obliteration has a patchy distribution and normal lung tissue obtained by a transbronchial biopsy does not exclude rejection, a surrogate marker based on lung function decline is currently the gold standard: the presence of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS). The exact mechanism of BOS is unknown but repetitive damage of (sub) epithelial cells seems important and may lead to a response from the immune system and eventually inflammation. Due to this response markers may be elevated or decreased. This thesis describes the identification of patients who are at risk for developing BOS using blood samples obtained during regular follow up visits. CD30 is expressed on Th2 cells and a soluble form (sCD30) is shed into the blood if Th2 cells are activated. In contrast to values prior to LTx, we demonstrated that sCD30 values after lung transplantation did not discriminate patients developing BOS. However, we demonstrated that high sCD30 values before LTx were suppressed after transplantation. We hypothesized that immunosuppressive drugs suppressed sCD30 values and demonstrated in atopic dermatitis (AD) patients, a mainly Th2 associated disease, that the immunosuppressive drug enteric coated mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS) but not cyclosporine (CsA) indeed do suppress sCD30 values. The chemokine TARC binds to CCR4 expressed on Th2 cells. We demonstrated that TARC levels in patients developing BOS were lower compared to non-BOS patients. If TARC values were below the 325 pg/ml at the first month after LTx there is an increased risk of developing BOS. In our cohort of AD patients we demonstrated a correlation between TARC levels and parameters to evaluate disease activity not only during EC-MPS treatment but also during CsA. The mannose binding lectin (MBL) is an important player in innate immunity and plays a role in the elimination of viruses and bacteria. We demonstrated a correlation between low MBL values before and CMV reactivation after LTx. There was a trend between low MBL levels before transplantation and a superior survival rate after transplantation. No association was found between MBL values and the development of BOS. Natural Killer (NK) cells are one of the main cellular components of the innate immunity and play a role in the lysis of viral infected cells. The action of NK cells is controlled by activating and inhitory Killer Immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs). We demonstrated that KIR gene content of recipients, escpecially activating KIRs, is associated with BOS but not with the reactivation of CMV. In conclusion we found that MBL values, KIR genotype and TARC values are associated with the development of BOS and that the type of immune suppressive regimen applied after LTx may influence the applicability of possible biomarkers.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['In this thesis we investigated whether population-based studies with routinely collected data are eligible to assess (adverse) outcome after trauma. We used the Dutch trauma registry\\r\\nwhich was designed in order to get insight into the magnitude of trauma victims in the Netherlands and to measure, evaluate and improve the outcome of the quality of the trauma care. We evaluate outcome prediction models, the effect of several interventions and trauma systems, and the economic aspects of adverse outcome in trauma care.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral international prediction models, based on the Trauma and Injury Severity Score (TRISS), can be used to calculate the probability of survival after trauma with adjustment for patient characteristics. In Chapter 2 the performance of these prediction models were tested in a single, large cohort. The results described in this chapter demonstrated that there was no single ‘best’ model. The discriminative power decreases in groups of patients with severe traumatic brain injury and those of older age with an isolated hip fracture. In Chapter 3 the results showed that the trauma care in the Dutch county Noord-Brabant is comparable with international norms. In Chapter 3 the admission policy for trauma patients in Noord-Brabant was evaluated also. Because there was no funding for centralisation of trauma care, the different chain partners in Noord-Brabant agreed to continue after the assignment of the trauma centre the existing policy of transporting trauma patients to the nearest hospital. After stabilisation, patients are further transferred to the trauma centre when necessary. The hypothesis that there is no difference in risk of hospital death between major trauma patients transferred from another hospital to the trauma centre and those directly admitted to the trauma centre was confirmed. In Chapter 4 we analysed the effect of the helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS) on mortality. The patients with severe traumatic brain injury had a non-significant association with a higher risk of dying when they were treated by the HEMS at the accident scene. Our study suggests that the higher mortality risk for patients with severe traumatic brain injury is caused by this increased prehospital time. For patients without severe brain injury the increased time did not have to seem a negative effect. Short distances and a high number of well equipped hospitals in the county could be an explanation for the results in Chapter 3 and 4.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe results of Chapter 5 show that diagnosis-related complications increase the costs of hospital care, with adjustment for age and injury severity, with a total monetary amount of € 5 420. Chapter 6 of is the basic step in the development of a model to predict with patient characteristics the probabilities of absence of various types of complications. Separate models for diagnosis- and institution-related complications were developed. Using these formulas the expected admissions without complications can be calculated and compared with those observed in order to measure and compare the quality of hospital care given to different trauma populations.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Since their original identification in 2002, MICAL proteins have been implicated in various physiological and pathological processes including axon guidance, tight junction formation, spinal cord injury and cancer. MICALs mediate cell signaling via their unusual N-terminal monooxygenase (MO) domain and various C-terminal protein-protein interacting modules, including a Calponin Homology (CH) domain, a LIM domain and coiled-coil motifs (CC). The constitutively active MO domain (i.e. C-terminally truncated MICAL-1) catalyzes the synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in presence of NADPH. In mammalian cells, the MO domain induces cell contraction but this effect does not depend on H2O2. This result supports the idea that the effects of MICAL-1 on cell morphology are mediated by direct redox modification of potential substrates such as CRMP and F-actin. The MICAL C-terminal domains have been shown to regulate the enzymatic activity of the MO domain. We further reported two novel molecular properties of MICAL-1. First, MICAL-1 can form dimers or oligomers most likely through the CH domain. This self-association may regulate MICAL-1 activity or function in the association with binding partners. Second, MICAL-1 is a phospho-protein both in cell lines and in brain tissue. Serine 777 was identified as one of the phosphorylation sites in mouse MICAL-1. This finding indicates that MICALs may be regulated by protein kinases. The multidomain protein structure of MICAL suggests a role as a scaffold protein with the potential to recruit multiple distinct signaling and structural proteins into signaling complexes that mediate various cellular processes. To further characterize the signaling pathways in which MICALs participate, we used different approaches to purify MICAL-1-containing signaling complexes from mammalian cells followed by mass spectrometry to identify potential MICAL-1 binding proteins. The various putative MICAL-1 interactors identified implicate previously unknown roles for MICAL-1 in cellular processes such as cytoskeletal remodeling, tight junction formation, apoptosis, transcriptional and translational regulation. Several novel interactors, including NDR1, DOCK7 and staufen have been confirmed by protein-interaction studies of individual proteins. Among the candidate interactors identified, NDR kinases were further studied in more detail. NDR kinases (NDR1/2) did not influence enzymatic activity of MICAL-1, however, MICAL-1 negatively regulated NDR1/2 phosphorylation and therefore activity. This new mechanism of negative NDR kinase regulation was dependent on the competitive binding of MICAL-1 to the C-terminal part NDR1/2 which is also targeted by MST1 kinase. MST1 normally activates NDR1/2 by phosphorylating Threonine 444/442 (in NDR1/2). MICAL-1 prevents MST1 binding and thereby negatively regulates the pro-apoptotic effects mediated by the MST1-NDR pathway. These findings unveil a previously unknown biological role for MICAL-1 in apoptosis and define a novel negative regulatory mechanism of MST-NDR signaling. Finally, we observed overlapping expression patterns for MICAL-1 and NDR1 in the developing brain and provided data to suggest that MICAL-1, NDR1 and activated plexinA1 exist in a tripartite protein complex. Overall, our data contribute to a further understanding of MICAL proteins and their signaling roles and form an important basis for future studies into the role and actions of these unique intracellular proteins.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Immune evasion by pseudomonal proteases'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['The innate immune system recognizes and rapidly kills invading bacteria via different mechanisms. Bacteria exploit several strategies to evade recognition by the immune system in order to survive within the host. An important strategy of bacteria is the secretion of proteins that block crucial functions of the immune system either by binding or degradation of host proteins. The gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) causes chronic infections in patients with cystic fibrosis and immunocompromised patients. In this thesis new bacterial proteins and strategies of P. aeruginosa are described that interfere with recognition and activation of the innate immune system. Alkaline protease of P. aeruginosa degrades the ligand for Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) and blocks two out of three activation pathways of the complement system. TLR5 recognizes flagellin, the building block of the bacterial flagellum. This propeller-like structure is essential for bacterial motility and consists of flagellin polymers. Alkaline protease degrades TLR5-activating monomeric flagellin, in contrast to the polymeric form of flagellin, which is necessary for bacterial motility. In addition to mammals, plants have a similar flagellin sensing system via the receptor FLS2, which activation is inhibited via the same mechanism by alkaline protease. In this way, alkaline protease blocks flagellin sensing in both mammals and plants, while bacterial motility is maintained. Analysis of the complement inhibiting activity of alkaline protease resulted in the identification of complement C2 as another target of this protease. C2 plays an essential role in activation of the classical (recognition of antigen-antibody complexes) and lectin (recognition of bacterial sugar structures) pathway. Degradation of C2 by alkaline protease blocks both pathways and all downstream effects, such as recruitment of inflammatory cells to the site of infection, phagocytosis, and killing of bacteria. Since alkaline protease blocks crucial functions of the innate immune system, inhibition of this protease may be of therapeutic interest. We identified amino acids in the main body of alkaline protease inhibitor that are important for its inhibitory activity. Besides the already known alkaline protease, we describe a new protease of P. aeruginosa. This secreted protease degrades cellular receptors of white blood cells that are involved in cell adhesion and migration. We named this new protease immunomodulating metalloprotease of P. aeruginosa (IMPa). Alkaline protease and IMPa both from P. aeruginosa modulates crucial functions of the innate immune system. Studying the role of these proteases in vivo is important to understand Pseudomonas infections and to develop new therapeutic strategies.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Cellular immune responses to respiratory viruses'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['When a respiratory virus successfully infects the lungs, cascades of immune responses are initiated aimed to remove the pathogen. Immediate non-specific protection is provided by the innate immune system and this reduces the viral load during the first days of infection. The adaptive immune response is pathogen-specific but takes several days to develop during primary infection. In her thesis entitled ‘Cellular immune responses to respiratory viruses’, Mary van Helden studied several fundamental aspects of immune responses to respiratory viruses in mouse models. For her studies she used influenza virus, human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and its natural rodent-specific variant pneumonia virus of mice (PVM). Natural killer (NK) cells are members of the innate immune system and play an important role during respiratory virus infections. In her thesis, Mary van Helden showed that respiratory virus infections induce migration of NK cells from remote storage sites to the airways, resulting in increased quantities of NK cells in the airways. NK cells from influenza virus infected mice were, compared to many other members of the innate immune system, extremely long-lived. These long-lived NK cells were shown to proliferate in the bone marrow in absence of infection and upon respiratory virus infection. Whether these long-lived NK cells can memorize respiratory viruses, as recent literature has indicated for other viruses, requires further investigation. However, the results presented in her thesis suggest that the bone marrow might be crucial for maintaining long-lived NK cells. Although intranasal infections with influenza virus or RSV induced rapid early innate immune activation, Mary van Helden showed that this innate immune activation was relatively late in PVM infected mice and that early innate immune activation prevented severe PVM-induced disease. Furthermore, in contrast to causing pathology during primary infection, the early presence of PVM-specific CD8 T cells prevented severe PVM-induced disease. In conclusion, these results show that upon PVM infection, early reduction of viral load is essential for preventing T cell-induced severe pathology later, which can be mediated by PVM-specific CD8 T cells. Some viruses downregulate MHC class I to prevent elimination by CD8 T cells that recognize infected cells via this molecule. NK cells recognize the absence of these MHC class I molecules and therefore eliminate virus-infected cells that have downregulated MHC class I expression. Mary van Helden showed that mice that lack immunoproteasomes have lower MHC class I levels. She furthermore showed that splenocytes of immunoproteasome-deficient mice were not attacked by NK cells in naïve mice, but infection led to NK cell mediated rejection of these immunoproteasome-deficient cells. These results show that infection can induce NK cell-dependent rejection of an otherwise tolerated graft. In conclusion, the results presented in her thesis increase our knowledge about the ‘indirect’ role of immunoproteasomes in ‘tolerance versus reject’ decisions by NK cells in transplanted host. The results furthermore help to better understand the role of the immune system during respiratory virus infections and might therefore contribute to the development of new and safe drugs and vaccines to treat and/or prevent respiratory virus infections.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['In order to make them more relevant to professional practice, a significant shift among Dutch Higher Vocational Education (HBO) programmes towards competence-based education and assessments has taken place. This research has been carried out to contribute to the development of the quality of competence-based assessments, especially in view of the predictive validity of first year assessments for second and third year internship assessments. First a comprehensive model of the concept of competence has been devised. The model exists of three interrelated dimensions (knowledge base, professional performance, developability) that form the heart of professional competences. In order to be able to assess a person’s competence evidence must be found relating to all three dimensions and how they are interrelated. Second a framework has been devised to determine the quality of competence-based assessments. In this framework three aspects are important: 1) what is being assessed, 2) how the assessing is done, and 3) what the purpose is of carrying out the assessment. These three aspects were used as the basis for devising an instrument. In a pilot research the quality of the instrument was tested and in a subsequent research a panel used the instrument to determine the quality profiles of seven competence-based assessments of the first year of the social work programmes of Hogeschool Utrecht. The research showed that it was possible to establish a quality profile for each of the assessments which illuminates the strong and weak points of the assessments. A third research study was focused on the quality of competence-based assessments of internships. This study made clear that according to the assessors the dimensions of competences are given equal consideration but that not all competences of the study programme are relevant to internships. The assessors tend to have a holistic style of assessment as their assessment of competences is based on a general impression. Both the internship assessors and the students believe that the assessments contribute very strongly to the intern’s learning. Because the assessment of the internships is partly based on self-assessments a fourth research was executed at their quality. The outcomes demonstrated that self-assessments of third-year students appear to be more realistic than second-year students and that students who perform poorly in internships have a tendency to strongly overrate themselves in their self-assessments. The final study examined the predictive value of first year assessments for the assessment of the internships in the second and third year of social work education at Hogeschool Utrecht and the relation between the predictive validity of the first year assessments and their quality profiles. This research showed that there appeared to be a certain link between the marks for the first year assessments and those for the second-year internship but not for third-year internships. The previously determined quality profiles of the first year assessments revealed that assessments in the first year in which the capacity to develop and, in particular, reflection are assessed, can to a certain degree predict students’ competences as assessed in their second-year internships.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Elderly people are prone to develop antipsychotic induced parkinsonism (AIP), and there are notable variations in occurrence of this adverse effect in individual elderly people. Factors that influence the variation in occurrence of AIP have not been well elucidated. The main objectives of this thesis were to qualify the available rating scales for drug induced parkinsonism (DIP) and to give a recommendation for use in daily practice, to quantify the influence of several potential determinants that may explain variability of AIP, including the role of genetic factors, and to investigate consequences of AIP in elderly patients. None of the seventeen scales, identified in a systematic review, fulfil all criteria of an appropriate rating scale for DIP. The Simpson Angus Scale (SAS), the St Hans Rating Scale for Extrapyramidal Syndromes and the Drug-Induced Extrapyramidal Symptom Scale seem the most valid, reliable and easy to use instruments to evaluate DIP in clinical practice. Subsequently, we evaluated the clinimetric properties of the SAS by assessing fifteen elderly diagnosed with DIP by three independent investigators. The SAS appears to be a valid and by different instructed health care professionals easy to perform research tool to evaluate DIP in daily clinical practice. In a cross-sectional study with 150 inpatients, with mean age of 83 years old we found a prevalence of parkinsonism of 46% during use of haloperidol. Dose nor plasma concentration of haloperidol was associated with occurance of AIP. A not statistically significant trend toward a higher risk with a longer duration of use of haloperidol was observed. Furthermore we investigated whether previous identified genetic polymorphisms at DRD2, ANKK1, DRD3, HTR2A, HTR2C, RGS2, COMT and BDNF genes are associated with AIP in elderly patients. The results suggest that carriership of the -759 T allele in females may be protective against development of parkinsonism in elderly patients during treatment with haloperidol. No significant associations were found between AIP and the remaining selected polymorphisms. Our study adds to the existing evidence that support is lacking for a major role of the peripheral pharmacokinetic hypothesis in the explanation for the variation in AIP sensitivity in elderly. The results do also not allow a firm conclusion on whether pharmacogenetics is a important factor. Finally we focused on consequences of AIP in elderly patients.We evaluated quality of life (QoL) with the QUALIDEM. The presence of AIP adversely affects the QoL of elderly patients treated with haloperidol. The presence of AIP resulted in lower scores on domains assessing positive and negative affect and social functioning. Patients with AIP had less to do, and performed fewer activities without the support of caregivers. Previous studies suggest that treatment with antipsychotics may increase mortality in elderly. The causes of death appeared to be cardiovascular or infectious (pneumonia). The relation between pneumonia and antipsychotics is not entirely clear. We investigated this association in a nested case-control study. Use of antipsychotics in elderly is associated with an increased risk of pneumonia. This risk is highest shortly after the initiation of treatment with the greatest increase in risk found for atypical antipsychotics.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The use of antipsychotics to treat behavioral problems in dementia is common but controversial. This thesis aims to increase the knowledge about the prevalence and the effectiveness of antipsychotics among patients with dementia in Dutch long term care facilities (LTCFs), and to increase the knowledge of cardiovascular adverse effects. We assessed differences in the prevalence of antipsychotic use among patients with dementia in different LTCFs in the Netherlands, using the VU University Resident Assessment Instrument Database (VURAI-DB), which contains functional, cognitive and behavioral items of patients residing in LTCFs, and facility-level resident satisfaction surveys from the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM). We found a remarkable large variability in antipsychotic drug use (5%-52%), which could not be fully explained by differences in the prevalence of behavioral symptoms between the facilities. Facilities with a high prevalence of antipsychotic use were associated with average to below average satisfaction with staff, personal care and choice of activities. Facilities with a high prevalence of antipsychotic use were often large and located in an urban area. The available scientific evidence demonstrates that the effectiveness of antipsychotics is limited, and cannot explain the high prevalence of antipsychotic use. Therefore, we assessed the reasons why experienced elderly care physicians prescribe antipsychotics, and asked them about their expectations of the intended effects and side effects. The interviewed elderly care physicians expected that almost half of their patients with dementia and behavioral problems benefit from antipsychotics. Serious side effects are thought to occur only sporadically. We described the course of behavioral problems in patients with dementia during treatment with antipsychotics, using the VURAI-DB. The severity of behavioral problems increased in most patients, with only one in six patients improving. Although we do not know how this increase would have been without treatment, these results indicate that the effect is limited. The use of antipsychotics in patients with dementia has been associated with an increased mortality. We examined three possible cardiovascular complications of antipsychotic use in elderly patents witch may contribute to this increased mortality. These studies were conducted using the PHARMO database. This database contains information from public pharmacies that are linked to hospital discharge data. Exposure to antipsychotics was associated with an increased risk of cerebrovascular adverse events compared to nonusers (odds ratio [OR] 1.7). A novel finding was the strong temporal relationship; the OR for use less than one week was 9.9. We examined the risk of venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in elderly patients taking antipsychotics. We found no relationship between antipsychotics and the risk of venous thromboembolism. Antipsychotic use has been associated with an increased risk of developing metabolic syndrome, diabetes and hyperlipidemia. We therefore looked at the risk of acute coronary syndrome in elderly antipsychotic users. We found a reduced risk of hospitalization for ACS in elderly patients who use antipsychotics. Further research is needed to determine whether there is a true cardioprotective effect of antipsychotics or the results are biased by a low referral rate among elderly antipsychotic drug users with acute myocardial infarction.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['This thesis describes the development and validation of image acquisition methods and reconstruction techniques of focused small animal multi-pinhole Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT). Multi-pinhole SPECT can achieve sub-half-millimeter resolution with very high sensitivity by employing collimators with multiple pinholes that are focused at the same centrally located region. The U-SPECT-II, a small-animal SPECT scanner developed at UMC Utrecht, TU Delft and MILabs, employs such multi-pinhole geometries, and is used in all studies described in this thesis. The first study demonstrates that focused multi-pinhole SPECT images can be improved when scans are better targeted to the organ or tissue of interest. New tools are presented that facilitate targeted imaging of specific organs and tumors and a study was conducted to validate the effects of improved targeting of the pinhole focus. By restricting focused SPECT scans to a small volume, count yield was increased, and visibility of small structures was significantly enhanced. At equal noise levels, small-lesion contrast measured in a mouse myocardial phantom was increased substantially, and noise in in vivo images of a tumor and the mouse heart was reduced. Ordered Subset Expectation Maximization (OSEM) can be used to accelerate iterative image reconstruction in SPECT. When subsets consist of complete projection views, as is common in clinical SPECT with parallel hole collimators, even moderate acceleration factors lead to inaccurate reconstructions. In this thesis, Pixel-based Ordered Subsets Expectation Maximization (POSEM) is introduced, which is based on an alternative subset choice. Performance was compared with traditional OSEM and Maximum Likelihood Expectation Maximization (MLEM) for a rat total body bone scan, a gated mouse myocardial perfusion scan and a Defrise phantom scan. The results show that in many cases POSEM can be operated at acceleration factors that are an order of magnitude higher than in traditional OSEM. Another study investigates the influence of unwanted high tracer uptake outside the scan volume on reconstructed tracer distributions inside the scan volume, for Tc-99m-tetrofosmin myocardial perfusion scanning in mice. Simulated projections of a digital mouse phantom in a focusing multi-pinhole SPECT system were generated. Various scan volumes were tested with increasing levels of truncation. Despite an overall negative bias, all selected volumes resulted in visually similar images. After normalization to the mean, quantitative differences were small. Absolute deviations could also be reduced by performing a short survey scan of the exterior activity and focusing the remaining scan time at the organ of interest. The last study validates the accuracy of images of intratumoral antibody distributions obtained with focused multi-pinhole SPECT. Zalutumumab, a human monoclonal EGFr-targeting antibody was radiolabeled with In-111 and administered to mice with xenografted A431 tumors. Total-body and focused tumor 3D SPECT images were acquired at 0h and 48h after injection. Global SPECT imaging showed that at 48h after injection, activity was predominantly concentrated in the tumor. Full 3D histological analysis was performed, indicating that the SPECT distribution was morphologically very similar to the ex vivo EGFr distribution and that regions showing little SPECT activity were necrotic or exhibited low EGFr expression.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['In Chapter 1, an outline of the thesis is given. In Chapter 2 we concluded that most conservatively treated patients with VCFs had sufficient pain relief during the first 3 months. After one year a substantial proportion of patients still had disabling pain despite higher class pain medication used. There were no predictors for the development of chronic pain. In Chapter 3 we concluded that pulmonary PMMA embolism during PV is an infrequent complication without clinical sequelae. After one year, no pulmonary reaction is seen on CT. No definite relationship of PMMA emboli with injected cement volume could be established. In Chapter 4 we concluded that small and clinically silent PCE occurred in a quarter of patients treated with PV. Cement leakage into the azygos vein was the only risk factor.Over time, these small cement emboli remained inert without inflammatory pulmonary response. In Chapter 5 we concluded that perivertebral cement leaks during PV for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures occurred frequently. Cement leakage occurred more frequently with higher injected volumes. All patients remained asymptomatic and late cement migration during follow-up did not occur.  Standard post-procedural CT of the treated vertebral body in PV is not necessary. In Chapter 6 we concluded that for a substantial proportion of patients local anesthesia was not sufficient for pain reduction during PV. The severity of pain experienced by the patient is mostly not valued correctly by the operator. In Chapter 7 we concluded that clinical response of percutaneous vertebroplasty is not affected by differences in injected cement volume. There is no correlation between injected cement volume and fracture location, fracture severity and type of treated vertebra. In Chapter 8 we concluded that the incidence of new vertebral compression fractures was not different after PV compared with conservative therapy after 1 year follow-up. Only risk factor for new vertebral compression fractures was the number of vertebral compression fractures at baseline. PV contributed to preservation of stature by decreasing both incidence and severity of further height loss in treated vertebra.In Chapter 9 the results of the different aspects of percutaneous vertebroplasty are interpreted and discussed.'],\n",

Tegenwoordig kan de exacte locatie van de tumor binnen de prostaat bepaald worden met een MRI-scan. Door technische ontwikkelingen is het mogelijk om de meeste bestralingsdosis op de tumor te richten. Irene Lips onderzocht of het mogelijk en veilig is om de bestralingsdosis op de zichtbare tumor binnen de prostaat te verhogen. Door voorafgaand aan de behandeling goudmarkers in de prostaat te plaatsen en deze tijdens de behandeling dagelijks af te beelden, is het mogelijk om de bestraling exact op de prostaat te richten. Door gebruik te maken van moderne bestralingstechnieken, zoals intensiteit gemoduleerde radiotherapie (IMRT) in combinatie met deze goudmarkers, is het mogelijk om de prostaattumor met een hoge dosis te bestralen terwijl de omliggende organen zoals de darm en de blaas gespaard blijven. Hierdoor zijn de bijwerkingen van de behandeling beperkt en is de kwaliteit van leven na de behandeling uitstekend. Het gebruik van een dieet of een laxeermiddel ter stabilisatie van de darmvulling en daardoor een vermindering van de prostaatbeweging tijdens de behandeling, bleek niet effectief en wordt daarom afgeraden.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The fungal pathogens Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii are the leading cause of fungal meningitis worldwide. Until three decades ago both pathogenic yeast species were, however, rarely encountered. The onset of the HIV-pandemic during the early 1980s showed the deadly potential of the opportunist C. neoformans among HIV-infected individuals. Recently, it has been estimated that annually approximately one million HIV-positive patients develop cryptococcal meningitis, resulting in 625.000 fatalities. This made C. neoformans one of the leading causes of death, followed by tuberculosis, in HIV-patients from sub-Saharan Africa. However, not only immunocompromised individuals are threatened, as shown by unprecedented emergence of the primary pathogen C. gattii that causes expanding outbreaks in the temperate climate of British Columbia (Canada) and the Pacific Northwest of the United States. The application of molecular biological techniques in the field of cryptococcal epidemiology revealed that previously observed epidemiological differences between C. neoformans and C. gattii are much less black and white than previously assumed. Within both species genotypes exist that infect immunocompetent or immunocompromised individuals. Examples are the occurrence of C. gattii as the cause of cryptococcosis among HIV-infected patients in Africa and C. neoformans variety grubii infections among apparently healthy Chinese individuals. Subtle epidemiological differences seem to exist, and this is particularly visible between the current genotypes rather than between the species C. neoformans and C. gattii. Thus the advance of molecular biology has clearly shown that the current taxonomy of C. neoformans and C. gattii needs a thorough revision. The aim of this thesis was to investigate the epidemiology and population biology of the two major fungal pathogens Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii and thereby provide additional support for a future taxonomic reappraisal of the species complex. Both species are investigated using a comprehensive set of molecular epidemiological tools combined with diverse phenotypic assays to further unravel the geographic and genetic origin of enhanced virulence. This thesis consists of three sections: Section 1 contains the Chapters 2, 3 and 4 that focus on the epidemiology of C. neoformans in Croatia, the Netherlands and Spain, respectively. Section 2 includes chapters 5, 6 and 7 that focus on the epidemiology of C. gattii. Section 3 comprises the Chapters 8, 9, 10 and 11 that are all dedicated to the epidemiological and clinical aspects of the C. gattii outbreak in North America.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Idiopathic orbital inflammation (IOI) is a disease with signs and symptoms of an orbital inflammatory lesion with after local and systemic evaluation no apparent cause. Little is known about the etiology of the disease. This study aimed to answer three questions: a) what etiologic factors are involved in the pathogenesis of IOI, b) what diagnostic approach should be taken to diagnose IOI and how can IOI be classified into subtypes, and c) what therapies are effective in treating IOI. A case control study showed that the risk of IOI was increased in participants who had a higher BMI or who used bisphosphonates. The risk was decreased in participants with a higher socio-economic status and in women older at first childbirth. An almost significant association was found between IOI and autoimmune disease. IOI biopsy specimens were tested for presence of infectious entities using PCR techniques and Parvo-B19, Epstein-Barr, and Human Herpesvirus-6 were detected. Viral presence was statistically significant more often present in orbital biopsies of IOI patients compared to controls. A small case series described patients in whom diagnoses of both Graves and IOI were made in the same patient, at different times. It was concluded that Graves’ disease should not by default be an exclusion criterion for IOI. A stepwise diagnostic IOI algorithm was evaluated and demonstrated to be efficient and safe. The study advocates the reservation of a therapeutic trial of corticosteroids for patients with low suspicion of malignancy with muscular and apical mass localizations, or with optic nerve compression. Evaluation of another diagnostic algorithm to differentiate Wegener’s granulomatosis from IOI showed that diagnostic findings indicating orbital WG were ear/nose/throat involvement, multiple organ system involvement, a positive ANCA, and vasculitis on histology, whereas granulomatous inflammation without signs of vasculitis was more indicative of other orbital disease. After evaluation of classification systems for IOI, a new, combined histopathology and localization-based classification system was suggested. This combination was shown to provide a repeatable, easy to apply, plausible, and complete IOI classification system. Such a classification system is crucial in furthering our understanding of non-specific idiopathic orbital inflammatory diseases through research. The use of intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP) in the treatment of severe IOI was evaluated by comparing patients with severe IOI who had been treated with IVMP and oral prednisone or only oral prednisone. The group of intravenously treated patients did not show shorter treatment duration, nor any significant differences in symptom-free outcome and treatment-related complications. These results suggest that the benefit of additional intravenous methylprednisolone to oral prednisone in IOI is limited. Treatment of adult periocular and orbital xanthogranulomatous disease was evaluated and the combination of prednisone and azathioprine was shown to be most effective in aggressive orbital inflammation. Overall, it was concluded that IOI is likely a multifactorial autoimmune disease, that biopsies have a pivotal role in the diagnosis and classification of IOI, and that treatment of severe IOI is still unsatisfactory.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Abnormal Conduction in the Diseased Heart - Enhanced fibrosis due to reduced gap junction and sodium channel expression'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['The velocity with which the impulse is conducted is dependent on three different factors: excitability, cell-to-cell coupling and tissue characteristics. Excitability is mainly determined by Nav1.5 channels, determining the upstroke-velocity of the action potential, but also by Kir2.1 channels. Gap junctions, in the ventricles of the heart mainly Cx43, enable low resistance communication between adjacent cells, thereby increasing cell-to-cell coupling. The last determinant of impulse conduction, the tissue architecture, is largely dependent on the amount of collagen. Thin fibers of collagen between cardiomyocytes provide essential strength, but an excessive deposition of collagen, called fibrosis, can hamper impulse conduction. A decreased expression of Kir2.1, Nav1.5, Cx43 and / or an increase in collagen is found in many cardiac disorders. Although these proteins are considered as individual parameters, their remodeling generally occurs in concert in the diseased hearts, which suggests a close relation among these proteins. In this thesis we have focused on the interrelations among the different conduction determinants, and their effects on the vulnerability for arrhythmias. We hypothesized that abnormal sodium channel function results in abnormal Cx43 expression which in turn leads to enhanced collagen deposition.By using different types of stress in mice with a genetically abnormal expression of Nav1.5 or Cx43, we analyzed their interaction and effects on collagen deposition and subsequent effects on impulse propagation and arrhythmia inducibility. First, the effect of aging and pressure-overload on mice with a genetically 50% reduction in Cx43 expression was investigated and compared to mice with normal Cx43 expression. Reduced expression of Cx43 resulted in more excessive fibrosis in both aged and pressure-overloaded mice, due to an increased activity of fibroblasts. Besides, this enhanced fibrosis, combined with a heterogeneously reduced expression of Cx43, made the heart highly arrhythmogenic due to dispersed conduction. Pressure-overload in mice with a mutated sodium channel resulted in almost half of the animals in a typical Lev / Lenègre phenotype: progressively slowed impulse conduction through the specific conduction system, eventually evolving into AV-block. Surviving mice showed no abnormalities in vivo, but AV-conduction was delayed ex vivo, and tissue analysis showed increased collagen deposition. Besides, the Cx43 expression levels were decreased. If Cx43 expression is reduced to extremely low levels (~5%) in mice, conduction is disturbed, increasing the susceptibility for arrhythmias. However, arrhythmias could not be induced in all animals, suggesting important differences between arrhythmogenic (VT+) and non-arrhythmogenic (VT-) mice. We found that in VT+ mice, arrhythmia vulnerability was associated with lower Cx43 expression and higher macroscopic Cx43 heterogeneity. Besides, Nav1.5 expression was reduced in VT+ compared to VT- mice. In conclusion, the studies in this thesis have shown that Nav1.5 and Cx43 expression are strongly interrelated, and that abnormal expression of one of those proteins enhances the formation of fibrosis. The resultant is an electrically unstable heart, prone to arrhythmias.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['The Tuberculin Test and its Role in the Strategic Management and Eradication of Tuberculosis in Cattle'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['This thesis explores the necessity for bovine tuberculosis (bTB) eradication; considers the use the tuberculin test as a tool in bTB eradication and explores the need to select the optimal test methodology, to evaluate outcomes of existing procedures and to progressively modify aspects of a bTB eradication programme. Tuberculosis remains a significant disease of animals and humans worldwide. The mycobacteria which cause bTB have an extremely wide host range and serious, although currently probably under-diagnosed, zoonotic potential. Where bTB controls are effective, clinical cases are infrequent in cattle and human zoonotic TB is uncommon. The design of a bTB control or eradication programme should, take into consideration fundamental scientific and veterinary knowledge, the inherent strengths and limitations of the test, the epidemiological profile of disease, non-bovine maintenance hosts and the experience of other eradication programmes. Programme managers need to be mindful of the necessity for robust quality control: including tuberculin assay, monitor of test performance and other surveillance protocols, and assessment of herd health and other bio-security practices. Continuous and rational evaluation of policy efficacy, constraints to progress, optimal desirable goals and appropriate policy adaptations requires data and epidemiological analysis capability. The Irish national bTB eradication programme is utilised in this thesis as an example of science informed policy in a national context. The studies reported were representative of an ongoing monitor and evaluation process of the quality of aspects of tuberculin, the tuberculin test and the continued re-evaluation of existing policy protocols. Tuberculin tests are safe to use and continue to be the primary tool in bTB eradication programmes with the choice of tuberculin test determined by the ecosystem in which it will be used. This thesis assesses the impact of different potencies of bovine tuberculin on the comparative tuberculin test (SICTT) and the single intradermal test (SIT). It also compares the performance of tuberculin from different manufacturers. There was a significant difference in the number of reactors detected using high and low potency tuberculin but no apparent impact if the supplier/manufacturer was changed provided the potency remained constant. However, potency estimates from guinea pig bio-assay conducted during these studies were imprecise. Two examples of policy review exercises forming part of the quality control assessment on the outputs of the SICTT are provided. These affirm the reliability of the SICTT, in Ireland, at current levels of bTB infection and demonstrate that the Irish depopulation policy for bTB (depopulation, disinfection, contiguous testing and local badger removal where implicated) is successful in enabling herds attain and retain bTB freedom following restocking. In conclusion control and eradication of tuberculosis in cattle is a desirable objective for animal welfare, socio-economic and zoonotic reasons. Tuberculin potency is critical to test performance affecting both test sensitivity and specificity and therefore, the accurate determination of potency is particularly important. In the future, as now, eradication of bTB will undoubtedly continue to require a multifaceted approach if it is to be successful.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['In the Netherlands, yearly 7000 couples rely on IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) treatment as a tool to enhance their chances for a live birth. Despite the numerous advances in the field of IVF/ICSI, there still exists a maximum implantation rate per embryo transferred of about 30%. Implantation failure could be due to the embryo, the uterine environment or a combination of both. Since hysteroscopy has become easy to perform in an outpatient setting, it is increasingly recommended to implement routine hysteroscopy screening prior to a first IVF/ICSI. However, high quality evidence for this recommendation is absent. The aim of this thesis was to assess the true value of routine hysteroscopy in IVF/ICSI indicated patients, who are not suspected of intrauterine pathology. Focus was on the prevalence of intrauterine pathology, the observer agreement in evaluation of the uterine cavity, the endometrial biopsy and the cost-effectiveness of screening hysteroscopy. At the University Medical Center Utrecht (UMCU) and the Academic Hospital at the Dutch-speaking Brussels Free University (AZVUB) a group of 678 consecutive, unselected patients, indicated for IVF/ICSI and allocated for a randomized trial, underwent office hysteroscopy. Only asymptomatic patients, aged ≤42 years, with normal TVS findings and no previous hysteroscopy were included. The observed prevalence of intrauterine abnormalities at hysteroscopy in our patient population was 11%, which is lower than reported in similar previous reported articles (20-45%). Next to differences in the investigated patient populations, one of the explanations for this discrepancy could be the unsatisfying interobserver agreement on evaluation of the uterine cavity. Perfect agreement occurred in 77.6% of the cases. The interobserver agreement on the appearance of any of the predefined intrauterine abnormalities was moderate (kappa = 0.491). Also, the value of the hysteroscopy guided endometrial biopsy to diagnose chronic endometritis was assessed. The histopathology examination of the endometrial biopsy for diagnosing chronic endometritis was found to be reproducible between two pathologists. The prevalence of chronic endometritis was low, 2.8%. Moreover, the live birth rate did not significantly differ between patients with or without chronic endometritis, 76% versus 54% (P-value: 0.11). Also, the cumulative live birth rate per embryo transfer was not significantly different (Hazard Ratio 1.456, 95% CI: 0.770 - 2.750, P-value: 0.2). Therefore, the hysteroscopy guided endometrial biopsy did not seem to be useful as a routine procedure. Finally, the cost-effectiveness of two distinct strategies (hysteroscopy after 2 failed IVF cycles and routine hysteroscopy prior to IVF) was compared to the reference strategy (no hysteroscopy). In general, based on data obtained from the current literature, screening hysteroscopy seemed to be a cost effective procedure. Thus, during a screening hysteroscopy prior to IVF/ICSI only a small amount of intrauterine abnormalities are detected, nevertheless, it might be a cost-effective procedure. Future research to the true prevalence of intrauterine abnormalities at hysteroscopy, the precise increase in pregnancy rate after hysteroscopy and the aetiology behind the positive effect of a hysteroscopy must be performed before routine hysteroscopy should be implemented in the daily clinical infertility practice'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['With the increasing numbers of preterm infants who survive, it is of great benefit to be able to predict outcome to improve parental counselling and to identify neonates susceptible for neurological disabilities who could benefit from ‘developmental support’ programs. The aim of this thesis was to quantify magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings at term-equivalent age (TEA) in a cohort of preterm infants. Additionally MRI postprocessing techniques and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were implemented. It was assessed whether they could be used in the prediction of neurodevelopmental outcome at two years’ corrected age. We segmented the neonatal brain at TEA using an in-home developed, user-independent, automatic probabilistic segmentation method which is based on k-Nearest Neighbour. This is the first method that can segment cortical and central gray matter, myelinated and unmyelinated white matter (WM), cerebrospinal fluid in the ventricles and cerebrospinal fluid in the extra-cerebral space, brainstem and cerebellum separately. We found that relative volume changes of cerebral structures in reference to the intracranial volume (ICV) occurred in preterm infants around TEA. After correction for both ICV and postmenstrual age (PMA), ventricular volumes were negatively associated with cognition, fine motor and gross motor skills at two years’ corrected age in addition to neonatal parameters (gestational age, birth weight z-score, intraventricular haemorrhage and WM injury on conventional MRI) and maternal education. Additionally, the cerebellar volume corrected for PMA was related to cognitive skills after correction for the neonatal and maternal confounders. These findings revealed the possibility to use brain volumes at TEA as biomarkers for neurodevelopmental outcome in preterm infants. Besides the volume, the cerebellar N-acetylaspartate/Choline ratio obtained with proton MR spectroscopy was associated with cognition. Using DTI, we showed that fiber tracking of the corpus callosum (CC) and bundles through the posterior limb of the internal capsule (PLIC) can be performed in preterm infants at TEA. Bundle volumes and lengths and diffusion parameters in these bundles were associated with WM injury. Therefore quantitative fiber tracking can provide additional insight into the underlying changes in WM microstructure compared to conventional T1- and T2-weighted images. Fiber tracking parameters in the CC in girls and in the left PLIC for boys were associated with cognitive scores, fine motor and gross motor performance. Tract-based spatial statistics, optimized for the neonatal brain, can be used to assess the relationship between diffusion parameters at TEA and neurodevelopmental outcome at two years’ corrected age. An increase in fractional anisotropy en a decrease in radial diffusivity in specific WM regions are related to cognition, fine motor and gross motor outcome. The results of our study exhibited the potential use of diffusion parameters at TEA as biomarkers for neurodevelopment in preterm infants. We assessed the anatomy of the circle of Willis in our preterm cohort. The infants demonstrate a high prevalence of variant types of the circle of Willis at TEA. Variations in the anatomy of the circle of Willis are related to alterations in the flow through the internal carotid arteries and the basilar artery.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['This thesis shows that the exploration of human genetic disorders and animal genetic models can bring understanding of the causes and mechanisms of common psychiatric disorders. The first part of the thesis contains studies on genetic behavioral phenotypes in boys with Klinefelter syndrome, a human genetic disorder characterized by one or more extra X-chromosomes. The second part describes studies that specify genetic behavioral phenotypes using advanced mouse genetic models and techniques. The studies on Klinefelter syndrome (47, XXY) captured signatures of supernumerary X-chromosomes on different levels of phenotype expression such as the specifity of genetic autism phenotypes and the impact of the parent-of-origin of the supernumerary X chromosome psychopathology. The Klinefelter studies further showed that particular cognitive defects can be central to problems in social adaptation. A further challenge was to find genes regulating cognitive functions that influence social outcome. Therefore, a genetic mapping study in mice was started to find loci regulating ‘social cognition’ and to evaluate their function in humans. We used quantitative genetic analysis (using chromosome substitution strains) of temporal aspects of social recognition and discrimination to find genetic loci that relate to social information processing. A quantitative trait locus (QTL) for long-term social discrimination was genetically mapped to a locus harboring Pchd9 (Protocadherin 9), a gene that has been associated to human autism and social behavioral regulation in dogs. Pchd9-deficient mice were generated and confirmed impairments in long-term but not short-term social discrimination, while nonsocial discrimination was intact. We further showed that long-term social behavior impairments in Pchd9-deficient mice were associated with a brain region-specific reduction in cortical thickness in areas of higher order sensory processing. These findings show that complementary genetic mapping of clinically relevant mouse phenotypes may bridge the gap between genotypes and phenotypes in human psychiatric disorders, leading to greater understanding of the underlying biology. Overview of studies in the thesis: Study 1: Describes a general survey of psychopathology in 51 boys with Klinefelter syndrome. Study 2: Proves the specificity of phenotypes in autistic subjects with KS and 22q11 deletion syndrome through statistical comparison of both disorder autistic symptom profiles with the profiles of genetically heterogeneous autism spectrum disorders. Study 3: Investigates cognitive executive functioning in boys with KS and its relation to social functioning. Study 4: Shows that the parent-of origin of the X chromosome influences psychopathogy in KS. Study 5: Searches for core cognitive features in KS by cross-species comparison of recognition deficits in mice with a supernumerary X chromosome to recognition deficits in boys with KS. Study 6: Is a large study that describes the genetic mapping of temporal components of social memory in mice using chromosome substitution strains, leading to the identification of genes involved in social information processing and cortical morphogenesis across species.'],\n",

       "  'Description': [\"Background Although auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) or 'voices' present a debilitating symptom of schizophrenia, they can also be observed in healthy individuals in the general population. As the origin of AVH remains largely unknown, the aim of the present thesis was to shed more light on the neurobiological basis of this symptom. With this aim, the studies presented in this thesis investigated brain activation in relation to AVH. The first part of this thesis consists of state studies which investigated brain activation during the experience of AVH. The second part describes trait studies which focussed at comparing brain activation between individuals with and without AVH. These trait studies may reveal specific mechanisms predisposing a person to experience AVH. Methods To identify brain activation related to the state of AVH, participants were instructed to indicate the presence of AVH while functional MRI scans were acquired continuously. Using this set-up, the first study investigated brain activation during AVH and compared the resulting pattern of activation to brain activation during inner speech, in a group of psychotic patients. Subsequently, the second study investigated brain activation preceding AVH and the third study focussed on calculating the reliability of AVH-related brain activation in psychotic patients. In the fourth state study, brain activation during AVH was compared between psychotic patients and a group of healthy control subjects. In addition to these state studies, two trait studies were conducted in which language lateralization and resting state connectivity were compared between individuals who presented with AVH and a group of healthy control subjects. Results These studies showed that the state of AVH is related to activation in language regions. However, in contrast to normal inner speech, AVH primarily involved activation of right hemisphere instead of left hemisphere language regions. In addition, it was shown that shortly before patients experienced AVH, changes in brain activation could be observed in the left parahippocampal gyrus which fulfils an important role in memory retrieval. Moreover, it was found that brain activation during AVH could be considered reliable. Furthermore, the last state study showed that pyschotic patients and healthy individuals showed similar activation during the experience of AVH. The first trait study revealed that although psychotic patients display decreased language lateralization, this could not be observed in healthy individuals with AVH. Finally, the second trait study showed that healthy individuals with AVH display dysfunctional resting state connectivity within the language network and between language and memory regions. Conclusion From these studies it can be concluded that AVH may be initiated by spontaneous memory retrieval. This may lead to activation of language areas, as observed during the experience of AVH, which is likely to be related to the re-experience of the retrieved memory. The observation of dysfunctional connectivity of language and memory regions during resting state provides further support for the hypothesis that dysfunction of these regions underlies AVH. In addition, the finding of common areas of activation in psychotic patients and healthy individuals suggest that AVH represent a similar phenomenon in both groups.\"],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Cancer has an enormous impact on the lives of patients and on society and there is an urgent need for improvements in therapy. In this thesis, early-clinical studies into both safety and pharmacokinetics of novel anti-cancer drugs as well as into circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are reported. Safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of pazopanib, a novel anti-cancer drug that targets new blood-vessel formation, was investigated in combination with oral topotecan, a topoisomerase-I inhibitor. Pharmacokinetic analysis showed that pazopanib increased the exposure to topotecan considerably, whereas topotecan did not increase exposure to pazopanib. The most frequently reported treatment-related side-effects were anemia, leukocytopenia, neutropenia and fatigue. In another study, dosing recommendations were established for oral topotecan in patients with renal impairment. The data currently available demonstrate that no dose adjustments are required in patients with prior platinum-based chemotherapy or mildly impaired renal function (2.3 mg/m2/day on days 1 to 5 in a 21-day cycle). Three studies investigated pharmacokinetics of eribulin mesylate, an intravenous drug derived from a marine sponge that interferes with cellular replication and division, leading to cell death. Dose recommendations were formulated for eribulin in patients with an impaired liver function (1.1 for Child-Pugh A and 0.7 mg/m2 for Child-Pugh B on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle). The results of two other studies with co-administration of ketoconazole and rifampicin, respectively, on eribulin pharmacokinetics indicated that eribulin can be safely co-administrated with these drugs and that drug-drug interactions with other CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers are not expected. The pharmacokinetic interaction between food and lapatinib, an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 1 and 2 (EGFR and HER2), was also investigated. These observations can be put to use in dosing recommendations for use in clinical practice, which should lead to reduced drug toxicity. The second part of this thesis focused on CTCs. CTCs were detected by multi-marker quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) in peripheral blood samples from 20% of 82 early-stage breast cancer patients. Presence of CTCs predicted a significantly worse relapse-free survival (multivariate hazard ratio = 5.13 [95% CI: 1.62 – 16.31, P = 0.006]), compared to absence of CTCs. An exploratory study on the detection of CTCs in advanced NSCLC patients and healthy controls resulted in the development of an assay using QPCR to detect the presence of CTCs. Another assay was developed and validated using fluorescence activated cell sorting that enabled CTC detection, measurements of specific proteins in CTCs and their level of activation, CTC morphology and DNA content. Pharmacodynamics of activation of a specific protein (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase; ERK) down-stream of the EGFR signaling transduction cascade, as a marker for EGFR pathway inhibition, was also studied in CTCs of patients who were receiving an anti-cancer drug inhibiting activation of EGFR. This proof-of-principle demonstrated that CTCs can be used for pharmacodynamic analyses which can be applied in early-stage drug development.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The burden of breast cancer had been increasing in Asia. However, little is known regarding the presentation, management and outcome of breast cancer among multi-ethnic Asian women. Asian ethnicities, lifestyles, health beliefs, and even life expectancies are substantially different from those of western women, and each of these may play a distinct role in breast cancer presentation, management and prognosis. A major part of this thesis focuses on research pertaining to breast cancer in Asian women, using data from the Singapore-Malaysia Breast Cancer Registry. This registry comprises two hospital-based breast cancer databases (University Malaya Medical Center, Malaysia and National University Hospital, Singapore) which were merged to include more than 5000 breast cancer patients diagnosed between 1990 and 2007. The registry is managed by the Singapore-Malaysia Breast Cancer Working Group (SMBCWG), which is an international, multidisciplinary collaboration between epidemiologists, breast surgeons and oncologists from Singapore and Malaysia. Asian women with breast cancer were approximately a decade younger at diagnosis (median: 49 years), presented with larger tumors, and at later stages of disease, compared to their Western counterparts. About 10% of them had metastatic breast cancer at initial presentation. In this subgroup, it was found that surgical excision of the primary tumor is associated with a survival advantage, similar to findings of studies conducted in affluent Western settings. In patients with early breast cancer, a web-based prognostic tool which predicts the 10-year breast cancer outcomes and efficacy of adjuvant therapy; Adjuvant! Online, was validated. This tool which had only been validated in Caucasian settings, was found to be performing fairly well in terms of discriminative performance (area under Receiver Operating Characteristic curve: 0.73) in Asian women. However, the model was overoptimistic (by 6.7% in the overall cohort) particularly in women under 40 years and of Malay ethnicity, where survival was overestimated by approximately 20% and 15%, respectively. Adjuvant! Online may therefore need further adaptation to improve its utility in Asian settings. As ethnicity had been implicated as a prognostic factor for breast cancer survival in the West, the impact of ethnicity on survival after breast cancer in multiethnic Asian women comprising the Malays, Chinese and Indians, was evaluated. Malay patients were significantly younger at diagnosis, presented more often with unfavorable characteristics i.e. larger tumors, lymph node involvement, hormone receptor negative and poorly differentiated tumors, and were less likely to receive complete loco-regional treatment. Five-year overall survival following breast cancer was highest in the Chinese, followed by the Indians and lowest in the Malays. Compared to the Chinese, Malay ethnicity was associated with 60% higher risk of mortality independent of demographic factors, TNM stage, tumor characteristics and treatment. This survival disparity maybe explained by variations in tumor biology, psychosocial and cultural factors, treatment responsiveness and lifestyle after diagnosis of breast cancer. Based on the studies described in this thesis, it seems that Western derived knowledge on breast cancer may not be always applicable to other populations such as in Asia. Therefore, extending breast cancer research onto different Asian settings is very important.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['This thesis describes strategies for managing suspected venous thrombo-embolism (VTE) in a primary care setting. VTE, compromising deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) is a relatively common condition with an annual incidence of around 2-3 cases per 1000 persons. Most patients with signs and symptoms suggestive for acute VTE are first presented in primary care. In that domain, the primary care physician has to decide if additional testing is needed to confirm or refute a diagnosis. As signs and symptoms of acute VTE can be relatively mild, it is an easy diagnosis to miss. Consequently, the PCP is frequently confronted with a difficult dilemma in these patients: refer all patients would imply not missing a case but also would yield a very low proportion of actually confirmed cases (only around 10%); yet not referring a patients always poses a certain risk of missing acute – and possibly fatal – VTE. This thesis predominantly focuses on tools available to PCPs to help them with this difficult dilemma. In summary, these tools encompass a combination of clinical characteristics (summarized in a clinical decision rule) and D-dimer testing (degradation products of fibrin). In this thesis, it is concluded that in patients with a low risk of having acute VTE (as based on a low score on a clinical decision rule), a negative D-dimer test can safely exclude both DVT and PE. Moreover, such an approach is also feasible and safe if performed by PCPs in primary care. For PCPs the use of a point-of-care D-dimer test is also a safe and convenient approach. These tests provide results within 10 minutes, thereby enabling a safe exclusion of acute VTE during the consultation of the patient.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The insights derived from spatial localization of molecules in tissue sections are of great value for understanding and treating cancer and other diseases. These insights can relate to molecules linked to a disease as well as to drug molecules distributed across organs of interest. Mass spectrometry (MS) imaging can not only provide the molecular and spatial information of single molecules, but can do so for a broad range of substances, from elements to proteins. In one single measurement, the impact of these molecules in multiple physiological and pathological pathways can be analyzed. The value of MS imaging for cancer research is demonstrated by the insights in tumor malignancy generated with MS imaging in this research. Two breast cancer xenograft models, the nonmetastatic MCF-7 and highly metastatic MDA-MB-231 tumors, have been studied with MS imaging in combination with magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI). This study focused on the distribution of phosphocholine (PC), total choline (tCho), free choline (Cho), sodium and potassium in the two different tumors. In vivo 3-dimensional MRSI of MDA-MB-231 tumors demonstrated that high tCho levels (Cho, glycerophosphocholine (GPC) and PC), displayed a heterogeneous spatial distribution in the tumor. MS imaging data provided information about each individual molecule, with increased PC and Cho in viable tumor regions compared to necrotic regions in the highly metastatic MDA-MB-231 tumor type. The same molecules were homogeneously distributed in the nonmetastatic MCF-7 tumor type. Also, significant differences in the spatial distribution of Na+ and K+ in the these two tumor types suggested differential Na+/K+ pump functions and K+ channel expressions. The combined results provide a link to the impact of multiple pathways in tumor malignancy in one single study. In drug discovery research, it is important to know not only in which organs drug and drug metabolites can be found after drug administration, but also how much of drug and metabolites are present in each organ. However, quantification by MS imaging is challenging, with several factors affecting the results of quantitation of drugs in tissue sections. Therefore an experimental setting was specially designed to address the impact of several factors on drug quantitation, such as ion suppression, sample preparation and organ dependence on the mass spectrometric response of the drug using organ homogenates and drugs. Because sample handling is of such importance to the success of MS imaging experiments, a new method was developed for fragile tissue sections and localized washing, which consists of a wetted paper with the solvent of choice applied directly onto the biological tissue surface. The washing solution is spatially contained by the paper structure, thus the formation of a liquid film on the tissue surface is avoided. An additional advantage is that the paper used in the washing step can also be analyzed by MS imaging, providing additional information of components removed from the tissue surface while retaining their spatial organization.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Introduction: Schizophrenia is a debilitating psychiatric disorder with a life-time risk of 0.46 – 1% in the general population. It is characterized by psychotic symptoms, including delusions and hallucinations. Its predisposition is influenced by a complex interaction of genetic and environmental factors. Early genetic studies in schizophrenia were based on linkage studies and association testing, more recently complemented by genome-wide association studies. These genomic microarray studies also allow for the systematic genome-wide analysis of submicroscopic cytogenetic variation, i.e. genomic copy number variation (CNV) that includes deletions and duplications of more than 1 kb in size. CNVs are associated with different diseases. In this thesis we aimed to investigate the role of CNV burden as probable risk factor for schizophrenia. Another risk factor often mentioned for schizophrenia is increased age of parents. Epidemiological studies suggested an association between increased parental age and schizophrenia, autism, and bipolar disorder, although different associations have been found. These different associations raised the question whether there are diverse parental age risk effects for psychiatric diagnoses. Furthermore, we questioned whether an increased CNV mutational burden in the offspring could (partly) explain the association between psychiatric disorders and increased parental age. Methods: In the first studies we performed genome-wide CNV analyses in schizophrenia patients and healthy control subjects. We investigated rare gene-rich variants, and all reliably detected CNVs at ≥50 kb, respectively. In the last two studies we investigated the role of parental age on adverse outcomes in the offspring. First, we investigated whether parental age has different risk effects for four major psychiatric disorders. Second, we tested the hypothesis of a direct correlation between parental age and CNV burden in the offspring. Results: In the first studies we show that the overall CNV rate, and especially deletions, is increased in individuals with schizophrenia. Our results show that rare CNVs play a role in schizophrenia susceptibility and we identify three neuronal genes as candidate genes for this disorder. Furthermore, three large recurrent deletions are significantly associated with schizophrenia. In the third study we show that increased age of the father is a risk factor for neuropsychiatric disorders. We find different associations for autism and schizophrenia on the one hand and affective disorders on the other hand. We suggest selection into late fatherhood as the most promising hypothesis behind these associations. In the last study we provide strong evidence that increased parental age is not involved in global CNV burden in the offspring. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that both CNV load and increased parental age are risk factors for neuropsychiatric disorders, in particular schizophrenia. Remarkably, our findings suggest that both factors are independent events in the risk for neuropsychiatric disorders, implying that parental age does not augment disease vulnerability via increased CNV burden in the offspring.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Addiction is one of the most disabling diseases in the world. An important neurotransmitter system that has recently been implicated in addiction is the endocannabinoid system. The endocannabinoid system consists of cannabinoid receptors and endocannabinoid ligands that work on these receptors. Animal studies have shown that blocking the cannabinoid system prevents relapse to addiction, while activating the cannabinoid system with an agonist evokes relapse. Still, the involvement of the endocannabinoid system in addiction in humans remains unclear. The current thesis aimed to clarify the role of the endocannabinoid system in reward processing in nicotine addiction in humans. Brain function during reward processing was assessed using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). In the first study described in this thesis, we have shown that both chronic nicotine and cannabis use attenuates reward-related brain activity in the nucleus accumbens, a brain area well known for its involvement in reward processing. Next, the endocannabinoid system was challenged using the partial cannabinoid agonist THC, the main psychoactive constituent of cannabis. When comparing nicotine users with non-using controls, we showed that a THC challenge did not affect reward processing in the nucleus accumbens in controls, while it was attenuated in nicotine users. Thus, altered reward processing as is found in nicotine addiction is associated with increased sensitivity of the cannabinoid system. In contrast, the endocannabinoid system seems to play a limited role in normal reward processing. Together, these data indicate that the endocannabinoid system is involved in addiction, and possibly other diseases in which reward processing is impaired, such as depression and ADHD.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['In this thesis nodal characteristics have been assessed with high field Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) using a clinical scanner in order to discriminate non-metastatic from metastatic nodes of breast cancer patients. The final goal is to non-invasively determine nodal and tumor stage of breast cancer patients during one MR exam, thereby identifying which patients have non-metastatic nodes in order to prevent them from undergoing a surgical nodal staging procedure. First ex vivo axillary lymph nodes of human female cadavers were characterized at 7T MRI. The findings were correlated with pathological analysis. Morphological features were identified and quantitative parametric analyses were performed. MRI detected all 45 nodes in the specimens and 6 additional nodes that were not detected by routine pathological analysis. B-cell follicles, efferent- and afferent lymph vessels and blood vessels were identified on high resolution (180µm isotropic voxel size) images. Next the association of 7T MRI characteristics with metastatic nodal invasion, as determined by histopathology, in dissected sentinel nodes of breast cancer patients was investigated. Morphological criteria showed no discriminatory effect. Cortical thickness did show a high negative predictive value for the presence of metastases (threshold 3mm; p=0.021). T1, T2, T2* relaxation time constants and the apparent diffusion coefficients were also measured. Metastatic invasion resulted in a pan-nodal lengthening of T2*, even if only micro-metastatic invasion was present. The other parameters did not differ significantly. Nodal lipid composition was determined by 1H-Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy.The ratios of signals from unsaturated fatty acids to the total lipid signal differed significantly. Lipid content could serve as a marker for metastatic nodal invasion. The potential of saturation prepared MR methods for discriminating nodes was also studied. The mean amide proton transfer difference and the mean magnetization transfer ratio at 2800Hz were not statistically significantly different. As part of tumor staging of breast cancer patients, in addition to nodal staging, the feasibility of 7T breast MRI was evaluated. At 7T a 5.7 fold higher signal-to-noise ratio was measured than at 3T. Subsequently, the clinical application of 7T MRI in breast cancer patients receiving neo-adjuvant chemotherapy was explored. High morphological detail was obtained on fat-suppressed images (isotropic resolution 450µm³). The first results of diffusion weighted imaging and 1H-MRS were shown, proving that these techniques could potentially be performed clinically. Without the use of contrast agents, discriminating metastatic from benign nodes is not straightforward, even at high resolution ex vivo 7T MRI. Therefore a contrast material with a T2* shortening effect, gadofosveset, was studied at 3T. Gadofosveset-enhanced diffusion weighted imaging was able to discriminate metastatic from benign axillary nodes on the basis of a significantly higher signal intensity on post-contrast b=500 images. This thesis has explored the potential of high field MRI as a non-invasive method for staging breast cancer patients. Following the optimization of scan sequences, the combination of contrast-enhanced imaging with a negative contrast agent, using a breast coil which also depicts the axilla, 3T or even 7T MRI is a promising candidate for a one-stop staging tool for breast cancer patients.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Neuropsychiatric disorders like schizophrenia are likely caused by a large number of genes with a small effect that are difficult to identify using traditional genetic association studies. Therefore, we have applied system biology approaches in order to examine patterns of gene expression in healthy tissue and neuropsychiatric disorders. In the first chapters of this thesis we describe patterns of gene expression in healthy tissue of human and mouse. We first observe in two inbred strains of mice that two brain regions, amygdala and hippocampus, show strong differences in expression. Effects related to genetic background are for a large part due to a hybridization artefact. Next, we study the effect of common genetic variation on expression in blood and brain of healthy human subjects. This inversion on chromosome 17q21.31 has been associated with higher levels of MAPT, a gene linked with neurodegenerative diseases. However, we find the expression of other genes near the inversion to be influenced as well, in a tissue-specific manner. Finally, we study genetic and epigenetic regulation of gene expression and determine causality between SNPs, DNA methylation and gene expression in whole blood of healthy human subjects. We find that both the direction of association and the causal relationships are more complex than initially expected. In the second part of this thesis we examine gene expression profiles in relation to neuropsychiatric disorders. We first use gene expression in a population of mice to narrow down a region on chromosome 15 previously found to be involved in exploration behavior. We identify a gene, Ly6a, of which expression is both regulated by our region of interest and is part of a gene-network associated with exploration behavior. The behavioral phenotype of a Ly6a knock-out strain suggests functional involvement of this gene. Next, we examine an human whole blood schizophrenia sample. We find a gene-network related to schizophrenia, independent of possible confounding effects of antipsychotic medication. In addition, we find this network to be enriched for brain-expressed genes. Also, the results suggest that the MHC region, a region implicated in schizophrenia before, may increase disease susceptibility via altered gene expression of regulatory genes in this network. In the next study we aimed to complement findings from a large schizophrenia meta-analysis. We identified regulation of gene expression by the top 6,000 SNPs of this analysis. We subsequently tested these for differential expression in schizophrenia and identified new potential candidate genes. Finally, we study gene expression profiles of several human brain regions. A combination of system biology approaches allowed us to both discriminate brain regions based on their expression profiles and identify a gene-network in the cerebellum different between patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder and unaffected controls. These results suggest that genetic pathology of neuropsychiatric disorders can be different across brain regions and cell types. In conclusion, neuropsychiatric disorders are complex traits and the vast increase in the amount of available genomic information makes systems biology approaches indispensible to further unravel the network state of mind.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Electrophysiological and genetic insights into atrial fibrillation'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['In this PhD thesis we evaluated the role of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and the genetic background on atrial substrates required for the initiation and perpetuation of atrial fibrillation (AF), one of the most common arrhythmia. It was shown that dispersion of refractoriness, an electrophysiological substrate for the initiation and perpetuation of AF, is not influenced by the electrical remodeling during AF and it is mainly enhanced in the left atrium (LA) of patients with idiopathic AF. The influence of the ANS on dispersion of refractoriness is rather limited and dependent on the degree of electrical remodeling and the atrial site. In patients with early remodeling dispersion of refractoriness is not influenced by autonomic blockade (AB); while in patients with advanced remodeling due to long-lasting AF, dispersion of refractoriness after AB is only decreased in the right atrium (RA). However, the influence of ANS on complex fractionated electrograms (CFAEs) is greater. Areas of CFAEs can represent critical regions for maintaining AF sites, since they can be related to anatomic and electrical changes of the atrial myocardium. CFAEs are influenced by systemic blockade of the ANS. Such blockade reduced the prevalence of CFAEs in the atria of patients with long-lasting AF, and prevented the time-dependant rise of CFAEs in patients with a new episode of AF and thus in the early- phase of AF. The presence of CFAEs is thus, at least partly, influenced by the status of the ANS. The detection of CFAEs, however, has been controversial among studies. The most accurate technique to identify these areas is unipolar recordings with subtraction of remote ventricular activity (gold standard). With the bipolar technique, some areas with CFAEs may be missed while other areas may be erroneously identified as presenting CFAEs. CFAEs derived from activation times in unipolar recordings without QRS subtraction and a catheter placed perpendicular to the endocardial atrial wall come closest to the gold standard. In this thesis we also studied the role of Cx40 protein in AF. Based on literature it was concluded that heterogeneous distribution of Cx40 protein in the atria during AF can contribute to the stabilization of AF and altered expression of Cx40 protein in the myocardial sleeves of the thoracic veins may be the substrate for the firing foci that can trigger AF. However, Cx40 polymorphism was not present in a big cohort of patients with unexplained ischemic cerebrovascular events and it could not be used as a genetic marker in order to predict idiopathic AF in this population. Additionally it was shown that patients bearing this polymorphism had a reduced expression of Cx40 protein in their atria. However, the presence of this polymorphism was not associated with the prevalence of post-operative AF after cardiothoracic surgery.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Patients with severe hemophilia, a deficiency of functional clotting factor VIII, typically suffer from joint and muscle bleedings spontaneously or after minor trauma. The bleeding tendency can be effectively corrected by intravenous substitution of factor VIII products. However, about 25% of patients with severe hemophilia A develop inhibitors, anti-factor VIII antibodies, that neutralize infused clotting factor. More knowledge on the genetic and environmental determinants of the risk of inhibitor development may contribute to the prediction of patients’ individual risks of developing inhibitors. Therefore, in this thesis we aimed to identify patient-related and environmental risk factors of inhibitor development in patients with severe hemophilia A. In a single center cohort study we found that the type and location of the F8 gene mutation were important determinants of inhibitor development. In a systematic review and a meta-analysis we pooled data from 30 studies on a total of 5383 patients, including 1029 inhibitor patients to provide more precise estimates of the relative risks of inhibitor development for the various types of F8 gene mutations in patients with severe hemophilia A. That not only genetic risk factors but also non-genetic risk factors play a role in the development of inhibitors, is illustrated by a report of a discordant anti-factor VIII antibody response in a pair of monozygotic twin brothers. Therefore we further focused on non-genetic risk factors in an international multi-center cohort study among severe hemophilia A patients born between 1990 and 2000 (the CANAL Study). In this study we found that intensive treatment with factor VIII, such as during surgery or major bleeds, was an independent risk factor for inhibitor development. The previously reported association between an early age at first exposure and the risk of inhibitor development was largely explained by early, intensive treatment. Furthermore, early regular prophylaxis appeared to protect patients with hemophilia against the development of inhibitors. Contrary to several earlier reports, plasma-derived factor VIII products with considerable concentrations of VWF did not confer a lower risk to develop inhibitory antibodies than recombinant factor VIII products. Furthermore, switching between factor VIII product brands did not increase the inhibitor risk. To examine the association of dose, frequency and the time of starting factor VIII prophylaxis with the incidence of inhibitors we set up a large, international cohort study including 606 patients with severe hemophilia A born between 2000 and 2010. The findings suggested that prophylaxis does not affect the development of early inhibitors. It may, however, prevent late inhibitors, especially in patients with low risk F8 mutations. All doses and frequencies of prophylaxis used in our cohort carried similar inhibitor risks. After studying 20 years of hemophilia treatment still many questions remain open. More knowledge about the risk factors of inhibitor development is needed, for it is a condition for prediction and possibly even prevention of the development of inhibitors in patients with severe hemophilia A. If we are able to prevent inhibitor development, the morbidity of patients with hemophilia will be greatly improved. Moreover, inhibitors will then not hinder the cure of hemophilia by gene therapy.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['After myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock the inflammatory response is the result of an ischemic insult. Elevated procalcitonin levels, correlated to IL-6 levels, are triggered by bacterial toxins. In cardiac surgery with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) hypoperfusion of the gut may result in a loss of barrier function and as a consequence bacterial endotoxins may enter the systemic circulation. Alkaline phosphatase is capable of detoxifying endotoxins and extracellular nucleotides. Based on the promising results of alkaline phosphatase in the attenuation of the inflammatory response in several studies we focused in this thesis on the effect of bovine Intestinal Alkaline Phosphatase (bIAP) on the inflammatory response in the field of cardiology and cardiac surgery. In chapter 2 of this thesis the proposed mechanism of endotoxin release during cardiac surgery with the use of CPB is discussed, followed by both material dependent and material independent measures taken throughout the years to diminish endotoxin release. In chapter 3 we investigated the effect of bIAP in myocardial infarction. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) was induced in mice. BIAP was given intravenously. A single dose of bIAP reduced the production of the chymase mMCP-1 and diminished the systemic pro-inflammatory cytokine response in the acute phase after AMI . In chapter 4 a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study among a total of 63 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with low till intermediate EuroSCORE is discussed. Bovine intestinal alkaline phosphatase or placebo was administered as an intravenous bolus followed by continuous infusion for 36 hours. Five patients in the placebo group displayed a significant TNFa response followed by an increase in plasma levels of IL-6 and IL-8. Such a TNFa response was not observed in the bIAP group, confirming the anti-inflammatory activity of bIAP. In chapter 5 we focused on alkaline phosphatase release. The intravenous administration of bIAP as a bolus followed by continuous infusion to patients undergoing elective CABG with CPB leads to an initial rise of plasma alkaline phosphatase levels followed by a significant increase of plasma alkaline phosphatase at about 4-6 hours post start of surgery. This second peak of alkaline phosphatase has an endogenous origin. The most likely source is liver type alkaline phosphatase. To exclude that aprotinin as possible anti-inflammatory agent was the eliciting factor in endogenous alkaline phosphatase release we performed a small study in patients undergoing CABG with the use of CPB, but without the use of aprotinin. This study is described in chapter 6. In this study it is demonstrated that the release of endogenous alkaline phosphatase is not induced by aprotinin, and that it is only induced by bolus bIAP followed by continuous infusion. In piglets bIAP was administered intravenously, intramuscularly or subcutaneously either as a single bolus or as repated bolus twice a day, with an interval of about 8 hours for 3 consecutive days. No endogenous alkaline phosphatase release could be demonstrated in piglet experiments which are described in chapter 7'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['This thesis is the result of 20 years follow-up of preterm and full-term born ‘graduates’ of the neonatal intensive care unit of the Wilhelmina Children’s Hospital, Utrecht. The aim was to answer questions that arose during admission and follow-up assessments. Typical gross motor development of preterm infants Gross motor development of 800 preterm infants (gestational age [GA] <32 weeks) was assessed when the children were between 1 and 19 months corrected age (CA). The scores were significantly lower compared to norm-referenced values, most likely reflecting a variant of typical gross motor development. Prediction of neuromotor outcome based on brain imaging Sequential cranial ultrasonography (cUS) until term-equivalent age (TEA) combined with conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at TEA enables us to predict motor outcome in infants born preterm as long as experienced examiners interpret the images. Persistent normal cranial ultrasonography (cUS) is predictive of a normal outcome, whereas major brain injuries can accurately predict cerebral palsy (CP). Also in infants born full-term, cUS and MRI (including diffusion-weighted imaging) are effective tools to predict CP. Specific neuromotor developmental pathways We examined the association between PVL grade and gross motor functional abilities in 59 children with CP born preterm (GA ≤34 weeks) at four timepoints in their life (between a mean of 9.5 months CA and a median of 7.5 years). Infants’ gross motor abilities varied depending on the severity of PVL. Children with PVL grade I–II were able to walk independently, whereas most infants with c-PVL grade III–V did not achieve the potential to walk. Stability of gross motor function became more robust after the first year of age. In infants born preterm (GA'],\n",

       "  'Description': [\"Our ability to perceive, to act and to remember is a reflection of the elaborate synaptic connections and neuronal circuits that make up the brain. The formation of these connections relies on a series of developmental events including axon growth and guidance, synapse formation and cell death. The occurrence of defects in these events is thought to lead to mental disorders such as schizophrenia or autism. Neuronal circuits and synaptic contacts established during development are maintained during adulthood. Loss of connectivity in the adult brain is a hallmark of neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Insight into the cellular and molecular processes that normally control the formation and maintenance of neuronal conections will help to further understand situations of perturbed connectivity during disease and may provide new leads for therapeutic intervention. The aim of this thesis is to further our understanding of the functional roles of a large family of axon guidance cues, the semaphorins, during nerual circuit development (part1) and to characterize the signaling pathways that operate downstream of semaphorins in neurons (part2). In part 1 we show a novel and important role for semaphorin 3F (Sema3F) and its receptor neruopilin 2 (Npn2) in the formation of the axonal projections from the ventral tegmental area towards the prefrontal cortex (medial forebrain bundel). These projections are involved in cogitive functions and are altered in mental disorders such as autism and schizophrenia. We further show that Sema3F is not only a repellent cue, as demonstrated previously by several groups, but can also attract axons. Furthermore, we show that Sema3F not only acts through Npn2, but also through a new unidentified receptor. In part 2 of this thesis the focus is shifted to the intracellular signaling protein MICAL, which is thought to act downstram of semaphorin signaling. Here we investigated the expression pattern and analyzed the role for MICAL proteins in axon projection formation. We show that certain brain area's form an attractive neural system to further examine the role of MICAL proteins. Furhermore, we show how MICAL proteins can affect axonal projections required for memory and which are effected in disorders like stress and epilespy. In all, the results from the work discribed in this thesis form a valuable framework for future studies on semaphorins and MICALs in physiological (cognition and memory) and pathological processes (autism, schizophrenia, epilepsy and stress).\"],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Nosocomial sepsis is a major cause of morbidity in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), with coagulase-negative staphylococci (CONS) generally reported to be the most frequent causative micro-organisms. There is substantial evidence for the association between CONS sepsis and indwelling intravascular catheters, predominantly central venous catheters (CVCs). Due to advanced medical techniques survival of very and extremely low birth weight infants (VLBW and ELBW) has increased considerably and they are the category of infants at greatest risk of nosocomial sepsis. This thesis focuses on clinical management issues of coagulase-negative staphylococcal sepsis in the neonatal intensive care unit, in particular diagnostic aspects, clinical effects of antimicrobial therapy in relation to antimicrobial resistance, neurodevelopmental outcome and prevention. To avoid the use of vancomycin as empiric antimicrobial agent for neonatal CONS sepsis is an important subject of this thesis. We have clearly demonstrated that first generation cephalosporins, such as cefazolin, were clinically efficacious and that MIC values still remain in the susceptible range, despite their consistent use during more than two decades. Data from a second study revealed a striking discrepancy among mecA gene positive CONS blood isolates between universal resistance to oxacillin and apparent susceptibility to cefazolin and amoxicillin-clavulanate. The results of this study may explain the favourable response, although rarely reported, to beta-lactams, despite the fact that most CONS blood isolates are mecA positive. Using beta-lactams in neonatal CONS sepsis gives the opportunity to reserve vancomycin for selected cases and may postpone the emergence of vancomycin resistance. Another important topic of this thesis was the shortening of duration of antibiotic treatment. At first we showed that the removal of a central venous catheter is an important therapeutic measure in infants with clinical symptoms of sepsis. In another study we demonstrated that CONS are rapidly (within 48-72 hours after starting anti-staphylococcal treatment) cleared from the blood stream, and that infants show rapid clinical improvement with 24-48 hours. Finally, we demonstrated that 3 days instead of the generally used 7 days of antibiotic treatment was clinically efficacious in infants with uncomplicated CONS sepsis, in whom the central venous catheter was removed. A randomized controlled trial demonstrated the successful use of two doses of an anti-staphylococcal agent during the procedure of removal of a peripherally inserted central venous catheter to prevent CONS sepsis after removal, which is a new and important finding in case of prevention of CONS sepsis. Study of the neurodevelopmental outcome after CONS sepsis showed no cerebral white matter damage on MRI at term-equivalent age and no significant delay in cognitive and motor development at 15 months to 24 months corrected age.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Despite high pertussis vaccination coverage, pertussis is reemerging in the Netherlands since 1996. In attempt to improve protection against whooping cough, two major changes in the national immunization program have been made; the introduction of a preschool booster vaccination in children 4 years of age in 2001 and the replacement of the whole-cell pertussis (wP) vaccine with an acellular pertussis (aP) vaccine at 2, 3, 4 and 11 months of age since 2005. Despite these changes, pertussis is still reemerging, although the incidence has shifted to adolescents and adults. In this thesis we studied the effect of primary wP and aP vaccinations on the long-term memory immune responses against pertussis in groups of children between 3 and 9 years of age. We showed a superior memory immune response in children after aP vaccinations compared with children after wP vaccinations. However, in children 4 years of age an overstimulation of the immune system seemed to occur after the fifth high-dose aP vaccination. In wP primed children a high-dose aP booster at 4 years of age induced superior memory immune responses as compared to a low-dose aP vaccine and an extra aP booster vaccination at 9 years of age even further improved the pertussis-specific memory immune responses. Moreover, we showed an additional role for serum IgA antibodies against pertussis toxin in pertussis diagnostics in the vaccinated population. The findings in this thesis demonstrate the additional value of the investigation of pertussis-specific memory B- and T-cell immune responses that represent long-term immunity when antibodies have waned. We show that memory B-cell responses next to antibody responses will probably be involved in the reduction of pertussis disease after vaccination in children. We support that aP vaccines have improved protection against pertussis in children. However, further investigation to an optimal pertussis vaccination program with aP vaccines has to be done. Memory B- and T-cell responses provide more information of the immunological mechanisms of protection induced by pertussis vaccinations. Therefore, memory immune responses offer further hallmarks for the optimalization of pertussis vaccination strategies.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['The food-pharma interface: consequences of combined use of functional foods and statins'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['It is increasingly being recognised that most chronic diseases are multifactorial in origin. The focus of this thesis was cardiovascular disease (CVD), a multifactorial disease in which a combination of genetic and environmental factors contributes to the aetiology and progression of the disease. To control multifactorial diseases, a treatment approach in which medicines and nutrition complement each other may prove to be the most successful. In the domain of nutrition, apart from (disease-related) dietetic regimes, an increasing number of functional foods and dietary supplements, each with their own health claim, are marketed. These food items are considered to be positioned between traditional foods and medicines at the so-called ‘Food-Pharma interface’. The attention of the European Union regarding functional foods and dietary supplements has been principally directed to food safety and (claims of) efficacy, and most of the research focuses on these two areas. Currently little is known about physiological or behavioural interactions between functional foods or dietary supplements and pharmaceuticals. This thesis aims to start filling the gaps in knowledge in this field and adds to our understanding of the beneficial and harmful effects of the combined use of functional foods/dietary supplements and medicines. The present thesis shows that the use of functional foods and dietary supplements may offer opportunities to reduce health risk factors when combined with prescription drugs. We have shown that functional foods enriched with phytosterols/-stanols lower total and LDL cholesterol by 4% and 5%, respectively, when used in combination with statins in a real-life setting. At the moment, however, it is not clear whether these reductions in cholesterol levels lead to a reduced CVD risk. For functional foods enriched with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) it was found that patients on statin therapy were at a relatively low risk of future cardiovascular events, such that supplementation with n-3 PUFA did not provide additional protection against cardiovascular events. There are also potential problems related to the use of functional foods and dietary supplements. First, their use may increase the risk for physiological food-drug interactions due to the elevated amounts of specific functional ingredients in the diet. In an experimental animal study, it was shown that the cholesterol-lowering effect of statins was reduced when oat beta-glucans were present in the diet of female LDL-receptor deficient mice. Second, we showed that the use of functional foods or dietary supplements may lead people to indulge in self-medication, resulting in lower adherence to drug therapy. Research towards this behavioural interaction is currently lacking and will become more important in the future as the world market for functional foods and dietary supplements is growing.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['In this thesis, we tested the hypothesis that human stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes can bridge the gap between the preclinical and the clinical phases of drug discovery by offering a new model system for cardiac safety pharmacology that is based on human cells. We show that human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) have many similarities with the adult CM (Chapters 4-5), but that they are electrically immature (Chapters 6 and 9), a feature that limits their general usability. Human cardiac progenitor cell (hCPC)-derived CMs, however, are more mature and therefore closer to an adult CM (Chapter 7), but are so far not being produced in a stable and reproducible manner. The ideal safety pharmacology model will I) be applicable to use with existing techniques and methodologies, and II) resemble the adult human CM in great detail. We have shown here that different techniques, ranging from in-depth patch clamp recordings of ion currents, to AP recordings using sharp microelectrodes, and medium-throughput beating frequency recordings using an impedance-based technique, can all be applied to SC-CM. These techniques are relevant tools currently in use by both small and large (pharmaceutical) companies. As for the resemblance to the adult CM, we have showed that even though human SC-CMs functionally express all major ion channels with the exception of IK1, the response to drugs affecting several ion channels was not as expected. The clearly immature phenotype of hESC-CM is currently the biggest obstacle for introducing them as a tool for broad safety pharmacology screening purposes, and thus strategies to improve their maturity through increased expression of IK1 must be developed. Still, based on the expression of most ion channel subunits, human SC-CM may be a useful tool to study ion channel kinetics and the effect of drugs thereof during voltage clamp experiments. With regards to AP recordings, the same cells can be used for hERG screening but testing multi-target drugs requires caution. The more mature CPC-CM may be a better tool considering its higher expression of IK1, but its use is limited due to production problems.'],\n",

A patent foramen ovale (PFO) is a tunnellike communication between the right and the left atrium and has been associated with the occurrence of cryptogenic stroke. PFO closure has proven its efficacy in preventing recurrent TIA or stroke. An atrial septal defect (ASD) occurs when a part of the interatrial septum is missing and is characterized by a left-to-right shunt, resulting in volume overload of the right heart. Percutaneous closure has become common practice. New devices for PFO and ASD closure are being constructed to facilitate the procedure and to lower the complication rate.

       "  'Description': ['MMN In a national study on MMN we identified 97 patients. Eighty-eight patients participated in our study. Multivariate analysis showed that axon loss and longer disease duration without IVIg were independent determinants of more severe weakness and disability. IMMUNE PATHOGENESIS Prevalence and specificity of antibodies against single gangliosides and ganglioside complexes in serum were investigated. Anti-ganglioside IgM antibodies in MMN had a surprisingly limited specificity (against GM1, and occasionally against GD1b and GM2). Therefore, we investigated whether anti-ganglioside antibodies also showed limited clonality. Using light chain analysis of anti-GM1 IgM antibodies, we demonstrated that serum anti-GM1 IgM antibodies in the majority of patients with MMN have the same Ig light chain, suggesting that these antibodies are monoclonal. Patients with anti-GM1 IgM antibodies had more disability, more axon loss and more severe weakness compared to patients without anti-GM1 IgM antibodies.These findings support the assumption that antiganglioside IgM antibodies play a role in MMN pathogenesis. It is not clear whether MMN is a ‘classic’ autoimmune disease (AID). Since different AID often co-occur within patients and their families, we studied the prevalence of AID among MMN patients and their families. In a case-control study encompassing 81 MMN patients and 417 first-degree relatives, and 438 controls and 2,377 first-degree relatives we found that AID are more common in MMN patients (11%) compared to controls (5%). We also studied variation in the activity of the classical and lectin pathway of the complement system in MMN patients and controls. We found no difference in activity of both pathways and complement activity was not associated with outcome of MMN. GENETICS The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) locus is highly heterogeneous, and several HLA alleles have been found associated with AID. A case-control study showed that HLA-DRB1*15 is associated with MMN. Although this finding may support the hypothesis that MMN is a classic AID, we did not find increased frequencies of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes that are common in a number of other AID. TREATMENT Maintenance treatment with IVIg every few weeks is necessary because the beneficial effects only last a few weeks. A cross-sectional descriptive study showed that IVIg treatment at home is time-saving and reduces the number of days missed at work. Home-treatment is safe and more convenient for most patients. Despite its use, the mechanisms of IVIg that underlie its efficacy in MMN have not been studied in detail. Relevant effector mechanisms of IVIg include anti-idiotype effects, and modulation of B-cell and complement function, among others. We compared the complement-activating properties of anti-GM1 IgM antibodies in sera from MMN patients and disease controls. We showed that anti-GM1 IgM antibodies in sera from MMN patients efficiently activate complement in comparison with disease controls. The addition of IVIg reduced complement deposition significantly. IVIg also reduced concentrations of crucial classical pathway components including C1q in sera of MMN patients. IVIg may thus exert both local and systemic effects on the classical route of the complement system, which may contribute to reduced complement deposition in nerves.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Relationships between different reproductive hormones were studied in the dog 1) around the time of ovulation, 2) during spontaneous and aglepristone-induced parturition, 3) before and after gonadectomy in both males and females, and 4) before and after chemical castration with the GnRH-agonist deslorelin in males. Additionally, the effect of trilostane, a competitive inhibitor of 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, on progesterone production was studied. The most important conclusions from these studies were: - the plasma concentrations of LH and FSH are differentially regulated; - oestradiol-17β probably exerts a positive feedback effect on preovulatory LH release, as in other species; - the start of the preovulatory LH surge is associated with a slight increase in plasma progesterone concentration; - shortly after the LH surge the plasma progesterone concentration remained stable for a variable period before rising sharply. This could reflect variation in the interval between the preovulatory LH surge and ovulation, suggesting that measurement of the preovulatory LH surge is less reliable than progesterone for determining the exact time of ovulation; - aglepristone is an effective and safe drug for the induction of parturition in dogs that are 58 days pregnant and carry 3 or more pups. Parturition occurred 41 h (mean; range 32 h – 56 h), after the first dose of aglepristone. The progress of whelping and the survival and growth of pups were similar in the control and induced group. More research is necessary to determine the potential use of aglepristone in prolonged one- and two-pup pregnancies. - aglepristone-induced parturition is associated with incomplete luteolysis, an altered plasma PGFM profile, and elevated postpartum plasma cortisol concentrations; - GnRH administration in intact male and female anoestrous dogs induces increased plasma concentrations of LH, FSH, oestradiol and testosterone; - gonadectomy results in increased plasma concentrations of LH and FSH; - the ranges of the plasma oestradiol concentrations in anoestrous and ovariectomized bitches overlap; - the following parameters appear to be appropriate to verify the presence or absence of functional gonadal tissue - the basal plasma FSH concentration in bitches and male dogs; - the basal plasma testosterone concentration in male dogs; - the plasma oestradiol concentration 120 min after GnRH administration in bitches; - chemical castration of male dogs, caused by use of a deslorelin implant, induces decreased plasma concentrations of LH and FSH and, as a consequence, lowers plasma oestradiol and testosterone concentrations to values similar to those after surgical castration; - administration of the GnRH analogue buserelin in chemically castrated male dogs, at 4.5 months after administration of a deslorelin implant, induced a significant increase of the plasma LH concentration, indicating that the pituitary gonadotrophs were not completely desensitized in all dogs; - trilostane is effective in decreasing plasma progesterone concentration during the luteal phase, but the treatment regimen used in this study resulted in less clear-cut inhibition of ovarian steroidogenesis than is probably needed for abortion. Increasing the dose of trilostane is probably not a good option, for the adrenal reserve capacity had decreased more than what is considered to be safe in dogs.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['MicroRNAs regulate endocardial cushion differentiation To investigate more specifically the function of miRNAs in both the myocardium and endocardium, I generated MZdicer mutant lines carrying either a cmlc2:GFP (myocardium) or a kdr-l:GFP (endothelial cells, endocardium) transgene. We performed detailed protein and mRNA expression analysis and found that the endocardium was most affected by a loss of miRNAs. Endocardial cushion (EC/ valve) specific markers like hyaluronic acid synthase 2 (has2) and the cell surface protein Alcama/Dm-grasp, were ectopically expressed in endocardial cells lining the chambers of MZdicer mutant hearts indicating an expansion of the EC primordium. We subsequently identified miR-23 to be functionally responsible for restricting valve formation in the embryo. MiR-23 knockdown resulted in a similar EC expansion and reintroducing miR-23 rescued the MZdicer endocardial phenotype. We could detect miR-23 expression in the ECs from 53hpf, 20 hours after the onset of cardiac cushion differentiation. Interestingly, when we overexpressed miR-23 in mouse embryonic endothelial cells (MEECs), we could inhibit a TGF-β induced EMT response. We next searched for miR-23 target genes. We selected a group of candidate genes that were specifically expressed in mouse embryonic hearts at E10.5 and contain a putative miR-23 3’UTR target sequence (www.targetscan.org). We subsequently selected candidate genes that were shown to be up-regulated during EMT in MEECs and identified functional interactions with miR-23 using zebrafish 3’UTR sequences. This study identified three novel miR-23 targets; has2, transmembrane protein 2 (tmem2) and β-catenin interacting protein 1 (ctnnbip1/icat). Having established that miR-23 regulates these genes and EC formation in the embryo, we finally showed that extracellular HA production is directly responsible for the excessive endocardial cushion cell differentiation in dicermutants.HA can bind the CD44 receptor and thereby stimulate the PI3K pathway, which results in increased Has2 expression. In addition, the HA/CD44/ErbB2 interaction induces β-catenin activation, which results in the induction of Has2 expression. Therefore based on my studies we have proposed that excessive HA production in the cardiac jelly due to a loss of miR-23 function, inducesan auto regulatory loop in normally non-responsive cells which start to express has2 resulting in more HA secretion. With this study we were the first to report a role for miRNAs during cardiac valve development.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Studies in nonhuman primates are indicated in translating research results towards a clinical application, in particular to assess the safety and efficacy of immunosuppressives and cell therapy products. This requires a thorough consideration of animal well-being, i.e., the 3 Rs refinement, reduction, and replacement. A comprehensive refinement approach was initiated in the model of transplanting insulin-producing porcine pancreatic islets of Langerhans into diabetic macaques; this model is considered most close to the clinical condition in a diabetic patient. The approach was as follows: Training animals for cooperation with handlers, including handfeeding and drinking; shifting; and limb presentation for examination, injection, or intravenous access for blood sampling and administration of medication, fluids and nutrition. Cooperation with handlers completely eliminated restraint in routine handling, and significantly reduced the stress to the animals as concluded from pathophysiological parameters. Animal cooperation facilitates medical management in chronic (disease) models and allows early detection of adverse events; Implementation of vascular access ports and in-depth evaluation of risk factors for adverse events in relation of the respective procedures. The introduction of novel placements and refinements significantly increased patency, substantially lowered infectious complications, and facilitated cooperation with handling in the familiar homecage. Also, a procedure was developed for access to the portal vein to deliver medication or cell therapy products in the liver, enabling repeated access without the need for multiple major surgeries; Optimization of diabetes induction using the chemotherapeutic streptozotocin, based on careful analysis of adverse events and illustrated by case studies. Also, protocols were developed to recognize adverse events in the earliest stage so that animals could recover from life-threatening adverse events with appropriate medical management; Evaluation of the limitations of the model. Using a well-selected immunosuppressive regimen, islet function and diabetes reversal up to 6 months was achieved. When combined with refinement described above, this period could be extended to meet requirements defined in a consensus statement written by international experts. However, complications were observed such as the absence of weight gain turning in progressive weight loss: this affected the consistency in outcomes and appeared intrinsic to the model and prompted for an in-depth evaluation. Contributing factors were identified and included metabolic incompatibilities (i.e., control of blood glucose) between the species, characteristics of the islet product, and absorption characteristics of immunosuppressive medication. This evaluation included data from other groups that reported long-term outcomes in pig-to-macaque islet transplantation, and the comparison with outcomes in clinical islet transplantation and macaque-to-macaque islet transplantation. These limitations are relevant and give a better positioning of the model when defining studies aimed to translate animal research to a clinical application. This comprehensive approach enabled to capitalize on synergies between various refinement tools, i.e., avoidance of stress and sedation/restraint when using vascular access ports in animals trained for cooperative handling. It is postulated that the increase in refinement leads to a reduction in animal numbers, on the one hand by increasing the scientific quality of outcomes (i.e., limiting confounding by interfering factors), and on the other hand by reduction of non-informative cases.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Cachexia is a major problem in many cancer patients with a global incidence of malnutrition ranging from 30% to 90% during the course of cancer. The main characteristics of this chronic condition of catabolism include progressive weight loss, anorexia, wasting of muscle and adipose tissue, muscle weakness and fatigue. Tumor-derived factors, therapeutic strategies, but also nutritional status, age and even stress and depression are involved in this process, resulting in a chronic inflammatory state and paradoxically, impaired immune responsiveness. Together, these factors may lead to disease progression, increased (infectious) complications and a delayed or suboptimal treatment regimen resulting in a reduced quality of life and a poor prognosis. Accordingly, a multi-disciplinary approach, including nutritional support is recommended which is initiated at the moment of diagnosis and runs parallel to the pathway of anti-cancer therapies. For that reason, a specific nutritional combination (SNC) has been developed for application in cancer patients. This concept is high in protein and leucine and is enriched with emulsified fish oil (containing EPA and DHA) and specific oligosaccharides. In preclinical experiments the SNC significantly improved the immune response and reduced the inflammatory state in tumor-bearing mice prior to weight loss. Translated to a setting investigating the resistance to infections with a relevant living pathogen, dietary intervention with the SNC significantly reduced the incidence and severity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa translocation in a mouse model of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. Plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines tended to be reduced and a strong correlation was observed with bacterial translocation. Several mechanisms might have played a role, including the modulation of the intestinal microbiota, an improved gut barrier function, improved immune function and a reduced inflammatory state. In a study in healthy human volunteers, both the efficacy as well as safety of the SNC was investigated as it was applied in a specific medical food. An additional objective was to investigate the incorporation kinetics of EPA and DHA (from fish-oil) into white blood cell (WBC) phospholipids within one week of intervention, since a rapid and effective incorporation of these n-3 PUFA might be important for cancer patients starting a treatment regimen soon after diagnosis. The nutritional intervention significantly increased the percentage of EPA in phospholipids of WBC within one week. Simultaneously, ex vivo immune responsiveness to LPS was increased significantly. In a study in newly diagnosed esophageal cancer patients, intervention with the specific medical food significantly reduced serum PGE2 levels. This effect was accompanied by a significant increase in body weight and an improved performance status. In cancer patients receiving radiotherapy, intervention with the specific medical food rapidly increased the percentage EPA and DHA in WBC phospholipids and reduced serum levels of the inflammatory mediator PGE2 within one week. Consequently, these results show that nutritional intervention with the specific medical food may represent a new opportunity for applications in cancer patients being an integral part of disease management to provide optimal treatment support. Additional research is recommended to elucidate the potential immunological effects and clinical benefits in different types and stages of cancer.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Costs and Outcomes in Hemodialysis and Hemodiafiltration'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Both survival and quality of life (QoL) are poor in patients on hemodialysis. Earlier studies have shown their QoL to be lower than in patients with for instance chronic heart failure, arthritis and metastatic colon cancer. Hemodialysis patients do not only face the symptoms of end-stage renal disease, but also the challenges of a demanding therapy. It is therefore important to explore determinants of QoL to ameliorate this outcome. Online hemodiafiltration might be such a determinant. It is a relatively new dialysis therapy that improves the clearance of middle molecular weight substances. It was hypothesized that due to this improved correction of the uremic environment, hemodiafiltration could decrease cardiovascular damage and thus cardiovascular morbidity and mortality as compared to low-flux hemodialysis. As resources in health care are scarce, there is an increasing demand that the surplus value of a new therapy is not only addressed by showing its effectiveness, but also by proving its cost-effectiveness. It was the aim of this thesis to evaluate both costs and outcomes in hemodialysis and hemodiafiltration. This thesis mainly included data of the Convective Transport Study (CONTRAST), a randomized controlled trial with 714 patients in 29 dialysis centers in the Netherlands, Norway and Canada. Patients were randomly assigned to either hemodiafiltration or hemodialysis. QoL was measured every year with a questionnaire, the Kidney Disease Quality of Life – Short Form (KDQOL-SF). This questionnaire combines the generic short-form 36 (SF-36) with kidney disease-specific QoL domains. Costs were analyzed using a societal perspective. Hemodialysis patients’ QoL improved over time. Physical domains however remained behind and these were especially poor. The physical composite score was one of the domains that differed in hemodialysis patients between dialysis centers. Current clinical performance targets in dialysis care showed no relation with patients’ QoL. Various parameters of protein-energy nutritional status did show a relation, but a composite score of this entity had no better prediction of outcome than its individual components. Hemodiafiltration had no effect on QoL or survival if compared to hemodialysis. An on-treatment analysis however suggested a positive effect of hemodiafiltration on survival in patients who reach a convection volume of more than 20.3 L per session. Even considering this fact, hemodiafiltration is not a cost-effective treatment. Although the additional cost of hemodiafiltration was relatively minor as compared to hemodialysis, it was not counterbalanced by a relevant gain in quality-adjusted life-years (QALY, a hypothetical year in optimal health). Physical QoL domains stayed behind in hemodialysis patients and its improvement should be a subject of future research. The variation in patients’ QoL between centers suggests room for improvement, which may be guided by the development of meaningful performance targets (e.g. on protein-energy nutritional status). Hemodiafiltration had no beneficial effect on survival or QoL. There may be a clinical advantage of hemodiafiltration as compared to hemodialysis in patients that attain >20.3L of convection volume, but still, hemodiafiltration is not cost-effective. Perhaps the surplus costs of hemodiafiltration can be reduced in the future; otherwise cost-effective alternatives for traditional in-center hemodialysis should be pursued.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) disease is a growing healthcare burden. Besides theassociated cardiovascular comorbidities, the AAA itself poses a risk for the patient in two fashions. First, it could rupture, which is associated with high mortality and morbidity. This thesis focused on the second, more indirect, hazard the patient with an AAA is exposed to: the operative risk. Our aim was to improve patient outcome by seeking discrepancies in AAA expressions and repair. Variance and variants in AAA Screening for patients at risk for adverse events due to aneurysmal disease is currently based on traditional risk factors, which does not allow individual risk stratification. The instability of the vessel wall was previously shown to be a part a systemic process, and we show that local proteins predict postoperative cardiovascular adverse events. Currently no differences among AAAs have been established. In this thesis we demonstrate that half of the AAA had only very low amounts of wall inflammation, more pronounced intimal atherosclerosis, more atherosclerotic risk factors and more postoperative events, when compared to the AAA with moderate to severe inflammation. The low-inflammatory AAAs appeared more closely related to atherosclerosis, and might need a different therapeutic approach. Furthermore, we report that there is a regional variance in wall composition inside the AAA. Inflammation and proteases were more pronounced at the lateral sides of the AAA, suggesting decreased local wall strength. This location coincides with the most frequent site of rupture, and merits a prominent focus of (medication-related) research on the lateral wall. Improving outcome after repair Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) comprises the majority of AAA repairs, and various access types exist, which influence outcome. We compared percutaneous access (pEVAR) and femoral cutdown access (cEVAR) both in a tertiary university center and in a more national database, both in the USA. We found that in our hospital pEVAR is associated with an improved (local) outcome and lower operative time and lower hospital stay. However, these results could not be generalized to a national level as this mixture of centers demonstrated only minimal or absent advantages of pEVAR versus cEVAR. When zooming in on physician specialty and experience in a national database in the USA, we noted that vascular surgeons repaired an increasing proportion of AAA overall from 2001 to 2009. Mortality was higher with lower surgeon volumes, especially for open repair. Medium and high volumes decreased over time, suggesting that it will be increasingly hard to deliver good quality treatment. For EVAR, more physicians had medium or large volumes, thereby significantly improving outcome. Current and future advances in knowledge should lead to an individual approach with a tailored cut off for intervention and management of co-existing diseases. Ultimately, if AAAs are better understood, patients who need treatment because of a higher rupture risk can be identified better. Also, the AAA repair of patients who are at high-risk for postoperative mortality and morbidity should be postponed as long as possible to delay the burden of repair, ideally to be repaired just before AAA rupture.'],\n",

The bleeding tendency in patients suffering from hemophilia A can be treated by regular intravenous administrations of FVIII. A severe complication that occurs in approximately 30% of hemophilia A patients is the recognition of administered FVIII as “non-self” by the recipients’ immune system, leading to the formation of FVIII-neutralizing antibodies. The initial steps in the formation of these antibodies are recognition and uptake of the administered FVIII by antigen-presenting cells, which is followed by presentation of FVIII fragments to the immune system on MHC class II complexes. In this thesis the mechanism of FVIII endocytosis and presentation on MHC class II by antigen-presenting cells was investigated. The thesis describes that the uptake of FVIII by antigen-presenting cells can be inhibited by shielding or modifying certain amino acids in the C1 domain of FVIII. A FVIII variant was constructed that is less immunogenic. Administration of this FVIII variant to hemophilic mice led to significantly less antibody formation than administration of normal FVIII. Additionally, it was shown that recognition of FVIII by antigen-presenting cells leads to donor-dependent differences in the presentation of FVIII fragments on MHC class II. The results described in this thesis contribute to the development of alternative treatments for hemophilia A patients resulting in less formation of antibodies against FVIII.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['CHECKing radiographic joint damage in early osteoarthritis'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Osteoarthritis Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common joint disease, characterized by pain and functional disability. OA commonly involves the larger joints, with symptomatic knee and hip OA affecting 6% and 3% of the adult population (age 30 years and over), respectively. The prevalence and disease duration will increase in the coming years since known risk factors for OA (ageing and obesity) are increasing in the community. Evaluation of radiographs The symptoms of OA are assumed to originate from structural changes of all tissues of the joint, consisting of cartilage degeneration, osteophyte formation, subchondral sclerosis (increased bone density), synovial inflammation, and soft tissue affection. In clinical practice however, an inconsistent association between structural changes and symptoms hampers the diagnosis of OA. Despite this inconsistency, radiography is the gold standard to detect structural changes since image acquisition is non-invasive, cheap, fast, and generally available. A drawback of the common method to evaluate radiographs (Kellgren & Lawrence grading) is that it provides a summary grade (0-IV) for the whole joint, which has low sensitivity to (subtle) change and assumes a fixed sequence in the development of OA characteristics. Separate quantitative features By evaluating separate radiographic features the existence of such a sequence can be evaluated. Furthermore, more detailed evaluation of radiographs is enabled when quantitative measurement is applied (instead of qualitative grading). Therefore, Knee Images Digital Analysis (KIDA) was developed, which (semi-) automatically measures joint space width (JSW), varus angle, osteophyte area, eminence height, and bone density. Early osteoarthritis For better understanding of OA and for developing adequate preventive treatment, focus needs to shift to individuals at high risk or with early disease, in which structural changes are still absent. Therefore, the Cohort Hip & Cohort Knee (CHECK) was initiated, in which individuals with early complaints of hip and/or knee OA were included who are expected to develop OA in the following years. This thesis This thesis aimed at improving the insight in onset and development of radiographic joint damage due to OA early in the disease. Separate features of knee OA are quantitatively measured by KIDA in CHECK participants. The challenges in measurement of separate features are evaluated, and also the value of these measurements for application in clinical practice and in detecting a relation between damage and symptoms. Conclusions The use of standardized outcome measures of OA is important in evaluating radiographic damage and in finding an association between radiographic and clinical characteristics. Proper image acquisition is of major importance to utilize the surplus value of KIDA, specifically in an early phase of OA. The measurement of separate features can be applied in clinical practice to evaluate radiographic changes in more detail, even in very early OA. Specific radiographic features are identified that are related to clinical outcome, and that are predictors of onset of radiographic OA. Based on measurements of separate features phenotypes of radiographic progression are identified, which is valuable in developing more targeted treatment.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['The cancer epigenome : towards epigenetic therapy'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Epigenetic gene silencing occurs in many important biological processes including differentiation, senescence and imprinting. In most cases, epigenetic silencing is orchestrated by an intricate interplay between DNA methylation, histone modifications and nucleosome remodeling that act in concert to provide transcriptional repression. Epigenetic gene silencing is deregulated in cancer, often leading to inactivation of genes that control key regulatory pathways in the cancer cell, which include many tumor suppressor genes (TSGs). The enzymes involved in epigenetic silencing of TSGs are often deregulated in cancer. In support of this notion, the recent cancer genome analyzes have identified an impressive and still increasing number of epigenetic enzymes to be subject to mutations in many types of cancer.  Epigenetic modifications are reversible, making the enzymes responsible for establishing these modifications promising targets for therapeutic intervention\\r\\n\\r\\n This notion together with the recognition that epigenetic enzymes are frequently deregulated in cancer has fueled the development of inhibitors of epigenetic enzymes. The usefulness of epigenetic therapy in cancer treatment has been clearly validated by the therapeutic successes of DNA methyl transferase inhibitors (DNMTi) and histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) in some hematological malignancies. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe combination of DNMTi and HDACi in cancer therapy is being tested in clinical trials, given the ability of these agents to more effectively reactivate silenced TSGs. Moreover, this combination therapy may also compensate for lack of potency and prevent dose-related drug toxicities that can occur with these agents as monotherapy. Indeed, the combination of DNMTi and HDACi appears to induce more robust clinical responses in several early phase clinical trials. One potential complication in the use of the current generation of HDACi and DNMTi in cancer therapy is their limited target selectivity and off-target effects. Consequently, current HDACi and DNMTi induce global effects on gene expressionthat control many cellular pathways that can be either supporting or inhibiting tumor growth, which might explain the heterogeneous clinical responses of tumors to these agents . As such, effective epigenetic therapy with these agents may benefit from identifying the relevant drug targets within these larger enzyme families to allow the development of more selective inhibitors. Another approach would be to develop novel agents that can selectively restore expression of epigenetically silenced TSGs while avoiding global gene activation and off-target effects. However, for most of these epimutated TSGs we have not identified the enzymes involved and consequently do not know the relevant drug targets. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe findings of this thesis address many of the issues described above and may therefore have important implications for epigenetic therapy in treatment of cancer. We discover epigenetic regulators of key biological processes including DNA repair, cell cycle, senescence and tissue remodeling that are frequently deregulated in cancer.  We elucidate the molecular mechanism for the synergy between HDACi and DNMTi in reactivation of silenced TSGs and identify the relevant targets of currently used HDACi in TSG reactivation. Moreover, we identify the nucleosome remodeler CHD4 as a novel and potentially drug-able target in cancer therapy. Finally, we describe a pharmacokinetic factor that may determine responsiveness to epigenetic therapy with the currently used DNMTi decitabine in breast cancer.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Although the success of pulmonary vein antrum isolation (PVAI) in eliminating atrial fibrillation (AF) has been proven, its impact on the left atrium (LA) remains uncertain. This thesis aimed to determine the impact of PVAI on LA size and function in patients with AF. The existing literature regarding the impact of catheter ablation of AF on the LA shows a great diversity. Several reasons may account for this diversity, including different imaging techniques and methods to assess LA size and function. Therefore, the first part of this thesis focused on comparing different methods to assess LA size and evaluating their accuracy in patients with AF. The first mentioned method, the LAD by echocardiography, is a rough measurement and only includes one dimension of the LA. Therefore, it should not be used as a representative for LA size. The Simpson’s rule with either CT or MRI is considered to be the gold standard for LA size assessment, since it takes into account that the LA is an asymmetrical shape. It is the method of choice for LA volume assessment in research settings. However, for clinical practice this method may consume too much time and, therefore, alternative techniques exist that closely correlate to this gold standard and which are much easier to obtain. Although these techniques have shown to underestimate true LA size, they may have enough precision for LA size assessment in clinical routine. The second part of this thesis studied the clinical implications of the LA in patients with AF and mainly focused on the impact of PVAI on the LA size and function. Two main factors may be responsible for changes in LA size and function following PVAI: 1. remodeling, 2. ablation induced LA fibrosis. This thesis has shown that the LA is influenced by both remodeling as well as ablation induced fibrosis post-ablation. PVAI resulted in a reduction of maximal LA volume in all patients, indicating an effect of ablation induced fibrosis. Minimal LA volume only decreased in patients with a successful outcome, indicating an effect of reverse atrial remodeling. As a result, LA function post-ablation was preserved in patients with a successful outcome and decreased in patients with AF recurrence. These results are of clinical importance since the LA function determines, to a certain extent, the thrombo-embolic risk within a patient. Based on the abovementioned results, it may be defensible to discontinue the anticoagulation several months after ablation in patients free of AF recurrences, because they showed a preserved LA function post-ablation. However, one must be careful because only the effect of PVAI on the LA was examined and no other ablation techniques that involve extensive additional LA ablation were examined. In addition, no different anticoagulation strategies post-ablation were analyzed. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the effects of more extensive catheter ablation in the LA on LA function and thrombo-embolic risks.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Lung transplantation is the treatment of choice for patients with end-stage lung disease. However, long-term survival is limited due to the development of chronic rejection in the donor lung of the transplant recipient, called bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS). \\r\\n\\r\\nBOS is diagnosed after lung transplantation when a decline in lung function occurs, which is not due to rejection, infection or problems of the bronchial anastomosis. The development of BOS is characterized by persistent injury of the airway epithelium that is caused by several factors. This process leads to inflammation and remodeling, which is followed by an aberrant repair response, and finally fibrosis and occlusion of the small airways of the allograft. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen BOS is diagnosed, the process is already at an advanced and mostly irreversible stage and treatment options are limited. The current status of diagnosis of BOS clearly indicates the need for biomarkers in serum and DNA that may detect processes leading to BOS before the decline in lung function occurs. These unmet needs are the basis of this thesis. \\r\\n\\r\\nTLRs are critical molecules for activation of the innate immune system by recognition of pathogens, and they can prevent the induction of allograft tolerance. Genetic polymorphisms in Toll-like receptor (TLR)2, TLR4 and TLR9 might contribute to patients’ susceptibility for BOS. These genetic polymorphisms could predispose to increased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, causing injury and inflammation of the airway epithelium. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe exact role of different types of cytokines in rejection or tolerance of the allograft is under debate. We showed that the T helper (Th)1 cytokines were similar between patients who developed BOS (BOSpos)and those who did not (BOSneg)patients. However, the Th2 cytokines revealed a different pattern between these two groups. This suggests that Th2 cytokines are involved in the process of chronic rejection, possibly due to the inhibition of transplant tolerance, the absence of inhibition of the Th1 response and the influence on proliferation of regulatory T-cells. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn relation to excessive injury and chronic inflammation, the process of fibrogenesis is considered to be of central importance to the development of BOS. Normally, after injury of the airway epithelium an adequate repair mechanism is required to prevent fibrogenesis. BOSpos patients, however, seem to have an impaired repair mechanism and a profibrotic airway milieu. They had a different genotype distribution of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)7 and lower levels of MMP-7 than BOSneg patients which might contribute to an impaired repair mechanism of the airway epithelium. Besides, there is more degradation and turnover of the extracellular matrix in BOSpos patients than in BOSneg patients as shown by increased levels of MMP-9. Though, the functionality of the genetic polymorphisms in the caveolin-1 (CAV1) gene is not known, it might contribute to fibrogenesis as well through the transforming growth factor beta signaling pathway.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion, genetic polymorphisms in TLRs, MMP7 and CAV1 and biomarkers in serum, such as Th2 cytokines, MMP-7 and MMP-9, are related to the development of BOS after lung transplantation, and may be potential biomarkers for clinical decision making.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Tight regulation of genes upon changing environments is important in establishing and maintaining infections by pathogens. In Staphylococcus aureus, gene expression and particularly controlled expression of various groups of genes dependent on growth and environmental conditions is essential for survival of the pathogen. Accordingly, differential regulation of unlinked genes encoding virulence proteins, toxins and adhesins is accomplished by global regulators, like two-component systems (of which 16 are present in the genome), quorum-sensing systems, DNA-binding proteins, and the recently identified sRNAs. Also features like operon structures and untranslated regions on the 5’- and/or 3’-ends play an important role in gene regulation. This thesis describes the interaction between S. aureus and its host and in particular the pathogens’ gene responses upon interaction with the host. A better comprehension of regulation in this important human pathogen will aid in understanding its capacity to cause such diverse infections and identifying potential new targets for antimicrobial agents. Colonization is the first step in infection. S. aureus is able to effectively colonize the human nose.. We verified the vestibulum nasi as niche and additionally identified bacteria in outer and inner parts of hair follicles, which might be an important lead to the differences in decolonization and carriership. Next, we determined important aspects in gene regulation. With the use of highly reproducible standard laboratory growth curves, we were able to accurately predict the operon structure of S. aureus. Operons play a major role in regulation of metabolic pathways. Moreover, regulation within an operon was confirmed for two innate immune evasion proteins, Efb and SCIN-B, showing the importance of operons. Small RNAs have been identified as regulators of many genes, including virulence genes, in various pathogens. In S. aureus, sRNAs were predicted and functionally characterized. An sRNA possibly regulating delta toxin, able to lyse many cells, was identified and examined further. Lastly, the altered gene expression upon exposure to human blood and IMDM both at 5% CO2 was examined. Especially the genes encoding Staphylococcal superantigen-like proteins showed a strong up-regulation in human blood, while no differential regulation was observed in IMDM with 5% CO2. Moreover, we have demonstrated that variances in gene expression between genetically similar strains can occur. In conclusion, the exact niche of S. aureus in the human nose was determined, different regulatory elements in S. aureus depicted and the difference in gene regulation upon exposure to human blood and IMDM both at 5% CO2 was analyzed. This thesis only describes small steps in understanding gene regulation of virulence genes and regulatory elements in S. aureus. Much more research has to be done to fully understand the world of the S. aureus transcriptome.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['From non-pharmacological interventions to therapeutic targets for the treatment of PTSD'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe anxiety disorder, which may develop after exposure to a traumatic event. PTSD gained a lot of attention in the media due to recent wars and the attack on the World Trade Centre in New York. Currently available pharmacological therapies are effective only in a subpopulation of patients. Therefore, better treatment options are needed. Development of new drugs starts with target discovery. A therapeutic target is a molecular switch, most often a protein, that, when triggered, selectively alleviates disease. Non-pharmacological therapies are relatively effective treatments for depressive and anxiety disorders. From studying the underlying mechanisms of the non-pharmacological interventions that lead to behavioral recovery, it may be possible to deduce novel therapeutic targets. In this thesis we have investigated the underlying mechanisms of the anxiolytic/antidepressive effects of environmental enrichment with or without voluntary exercise (EE/VE), re-exposure (RE) and food restriction (FR) in the inescapable foot shock (IFS) paradigm (an animal model for model PTSD in rats). Our aim was to identify pathways and proteins that can serve as therapeutic targets. EE, as opposed to standard housing, consisted of a larger cage with a shelter, large plastic tubes, gnaw-sticks, tissues, nesting materials, and sometimes a running-wheel. RE consisted of repeatedly placing the rat in the same box in which it received the IFS but without the shocks. Rats that were under the FR regime were provided with 60% of the amount of food the ad libitum fed control rats ate. We found that exposure to EE/VE or RE enhanced the recovery of the traumatized rats. However, FR did not attenuate the anxiogenic effects of IFS. We investigated these interventions to elucidate the molecular changes that might lead to recovery after IFS. Our discoveries that the neuropeptide Y1 receptor (Y1) and the corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 1 (CRFR1) are involved in this recovery are examples of therapeutic target discovery using non-pharmacological interventions. In conclusion we showed that EE and RE are very effective strategies to treat PTSD in an animal model. We hope that our experiments will contribute to the identification of therapeutic targets that, when activated, really cure patients suffering from PTSD or depression. Unfortunately, such targets have not yet been identified, which is why, until then, we really urge patients to exercise.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Genetic determinants for metabolic abnormalities'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Psychiatric patients often use psychotropic drugs. Apart from frequent problems regarding lack of efficacy, use of these drugs also often results in (severe) adverse effects. The use of (atypical) antipsychotic drugs in particular can give rise to weight gain and metabolic deregulation regarding glucose metabolism and lipolysis, resulting in an increased morbidity and mortality in these patients. However, not all patients experience these adverse effects to the same extent. This interindividual variability suggests that genetic susceptibility plays an important role. The studies in this thesis have investigated the potential impact of polymorphisms in the ADRA2A and HTR2C genes, coding for the adrenergic α2A- and serotonergic 5HT\\xad2C-receptors respectively, on metabolic complications in patients with and without psychotropic drugs. Comparing the effects of these polymorphisms on metabolic complications between these groups of patients adds to understanding the potential modifying role of psychotropic medication on the impact of the investigated polymorphisms. The studies in this thesis show that the HTR2C 759 C/T polymorphism has been associated with prevalence of obesity in patients without antipsychotic drugs and antipsychotic-induced weight gain. Carriership of the variant 759 T-allele resulted in a more favorable metabolic profile regarding these endpoints, which appears to be independent of antipsychotic drugs. The HTR2C rs1414334 polymorphism has been associated with prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in patients using antipsychotic drugs and triglyceride concentrations in patients with and without psychotropic drugs. Carriership of the variant rs1414334 C-allele resulted in an increased prevalence of the metabolic syndrome and increased triglyceride concentrations. The effects of the rs1414334 polymorphism on triglyceride concentrations appears to be independent of antipsychotic drugs. The effects of this polymorphism on prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in patients without psychotropic drugs has not yet been investigated. Carriership of the variant 1291 G-allele of the ADRA2A 1291 C/G polymorphism appeared to be protective for the metabolic syndrome in schizophrenic patients without antipsychotic drugs at the time of the study and was associated with lower concentrations of LDL cholesterol in obese patients without psychotropic drugs. Both associations require further study. Although the genotypes of the investigated polymorphisms contribute to increased or reduced metabolic risks, these genotypes alone do not fully explain the complex metabolic abnormalities. However, combined with other potentially relevant polymorphisms (e.g. within the leptin or histaminergic system) and relevant patient factors it may be possible to take steps in the future towards the development of algorithms that can be tested in clinical practice. If these algorithms accurately predict a patients metabolic risk, using these algorithms in clinical practice might result in a better treatment regarding efficacy and occurrence of adverse effects.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Since 40 years, angiogenesis has been recognized to be a prominent factor in the development of solid tumors and has been regarded as an attractive target for cancer therapy. A promising strategy to interfere with diseases where (over)expression of specific genes contributes to the pathological process, such as angiogenesis, is gene silencing by RNA interference (RNAi). So far, clinical success of RNAi-based strategies to inhibit tumor angiogenesis have been limited due to (1) scarcity of clinically promising pharmacological targets and/or (2) inefficiency or toxicity of the siRNA carrier system. In this thesis, we attempted to improve both siRNA target and carrier. Therefore, we studied a novel small Rho GTPase protein, Rac1, as a potential target for anti-angiogenic therapy. Our results indicate that Rac1 is an important regulator of VEGF-mediated angiogenesis and that knockdown of Rac1 using siRNA may represent an attractive approach to inhibit tumor angiogenesis and growth. At the same time, we tried to adapt and improve a novel class of biodegradable poly(amido amine)s, with built-in characteristics for intracellular release of its siRNA payload, for drug delivery purposes. By titrating the positive charges, these polymers were optimized for siRNA delivery. PEGylation of the polymers resulted in increased stability of siRNA polyplexes in salt and serum and further decreased their toxicity. Additionally, we modified a previously described lipid-based carrier for siRNA to target angiogenic endothelial cells. We show that these systems ensure cellular uptake and gene silencing in both murine and human endothelial cells. Further research should evaluate the use of these carriers for gene silencing in vivo. This thesis provides starting points for future research on the optimization of polymeric and lipidic carrier systems for silencing of genes involved in angiogenesis. This may ultimately lead to the development of safe delivery systems that enable therapeutic RNA interference in cancer therapy.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Obstacle Avoidance Behaviour during Locomotion: Strategy Changes as a Result of Visual Field Limitations'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['In order to walk through structured surroundings without colliding with any obstacles or parts of that environment, humans rely for the most part on the visual system. Therefore, impairment in the acquisition of visual information poses a threat to efficient and save locomotion through structured environments. One form of impairment is the limitation of the extent of the visual field, which is approximately 200° wide and 135° tall when unrestricted. Eye diseases and certain hardware devices may limit this field extensively. This thesis is concerned with the influence of visual field limitation on obstacle avoidance behaviour. In Chapters 2 and 3 it is investigated how limitations of the horizontal and vertical viewing angles affect obstacle avoidance behaviour. The results show that decreasing the size of the visual ﬁeld causes impairment of performance on several obstacle avoidance tasks. The ﬁnding that the size of the visual ﬁeld causes similar performance degradation for each of the tasks suggests that the effect is robust and not dependent on the nature of the actual movements required to complete the task. Also, a performance plateau was found between a width of 75° and 120° above which speed increases and below which speed deteriorates. Furthermore, an enlargement of the vertical angle yields a greater increase in speed compared to a similar enlargement of the horizontal angle. In chapter 4 it is investigated how the vertical viewing angle affects body kinematics and strategy changes during an obstacle crossing task. For all viewing limitations, participants choose to optimise safety at the cost of spending more energy. Moreover, it seems that walking with a preferred speed has priority over the minimisation of clearance to the obstacle since the latter was sacriﬁced ﬁrst as a consequence of compromised safety and a decrease in speed was only observed after further reduction of the vertical viewing angle. Finally, Chapter 5 presents a study on strategy changes during a steering task. In addition, head movement and balancing are examined. During the steering task similar strategy changes were observed as with the crossing task. As the visual field size deteriorates, safety becomes increasingly threatened causing participants to ﬁrst enlarge their clearance before decreasing their speed. Furthermore, speed of head movement decreases as the visual ﬁeld gets smaller while magnitude of head rotation remains unaltered. It seems that the spatiotemporal integration of small pieces of visual information requires additional time compared to the processing of larger pieces. In addition, the increased step width that is observed with a small visual ﬁeld indicates the presence of balancing impairment. The influence of visual field limitation on obstacle avoidance behaviour as presented in this thesis may contribute to several application areas. First, these insights may benefit people suffering from eye diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa and glaucoma in traversing their environment in a safe and efficient way. Second, it is possible to formulate guidelines for the procurement and design of visual field limiting devices such as Head-Mounted Displays and Night-Vision Goggles.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Despite advances during the last few decades in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), its incidence remains high. In this thesis, strategies are described for improvement of the quality of clinical management in patients with pneumonia and for the reduction of the healthcare burden. The focus is on the prevention of pneumonia, a better understanding of the immune response in CAP, further development of biomarkers, and adjunctive therapies.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nRecent studies have suggested that gastric acid-suppressive medication may increase the risk of CAP. In Chapter 2, a population-based case-control study is presented on the relationship between proton pump inhibitor (PPI) treatment and CAP. In Chapter 3, the cytokine response in a cohort of 201 non-immunocompromised patients with CAP is described. In addition to the inflammatory response as discussed in Chapter 3, the complement system is an important component of the innate immune system. In Chapter 4, the role of polymorphisms in the genes of these two lectins in patients with S. aureus peritonitis on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) is studied.  This led to the study described in Chapter 5 in which binding to the pneumococci of MBL, ficolin-2 and subsequently MASP-2 was explored. This study showed that pneumococci can bind MASP-2 and that ficolin-2 seems to be the overriding MASP-2 activator.In Chapter 6, a quantitative multiplex immunoassay for the measurement of serotype-specific antibody concentrations after the onset of CAP is described. The estimated contribution of the pneumococcus in patients with an unidentified causative agent of CAP was calculated to be 57%. In Chapter 7, the usefulness of serum angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) activity at the time of hospital admission as a prognostic marker is assessed. Serum ACE activity can become useful for the identification of bacteremia before the outcome of blood cultures is known. In Chapter 8, the incidence and predictive value of proteinuria as a biomarker for outcome in patients with CAP is presented. Proteinuria on admission was independently associated with increased length of hospital stay in CAP patients.In Chapter 9, the current literature concerning the various options for supportive therapy of patients treated with otherwise effective antibiotics is reviewed. In Chapter 10, a randomised placebo-controlled trial (RCT) using corticosteroids as an adjunctive treatment to antibiotics in patients with CAP is described. The median length of stay was 6.5 days for patients in the dexamethasone group and 7.5 days in the placebo group (p= 0.048).To further elucidate which patients benefit most from corticosteroids, the cytokine response of 304 patients in an RCT was evaluated in Chapter 11. The overall decrease in cytokine levels was more rapid in patients with CAP treated with dexamethasone in addition to antibiotic treatment than in patients without dexamethasone. In Chapter 12, it is shown that in patients with CAP, a cortisol level <10 µg/dL was not found to be associated with poor outcomes. Furthermore, patients with high cytokine responses and unexpectedly low cortisol levels (<50% of the patients with high cytokine responses) were shown to benefit more from dexamethasone therapy.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Role of the endocannabinoid system in human brain functions relevant for psychiatric disorders'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Impaired cognitive function is a fundamental characteristic of many psychiatric and neurological disorders such as schizophrenia or Alzheimer’s disease. The endocannabinoid (eCB) system, consisting of cannabinoid receptors and accompanying ligands, has been implicated in these disorders. In addition, behavioral evidence from healthy subjects indicates that modulation of the eCB system by administration of eCB agonists such as Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) impairs performance on cognitive paradigms. However, the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying these effects are unknown. In this thesis, results of functional MRI (fMRI) studies are presented in which we investigated the effects of THC on cognitive brain function of healthy volunteers. Healthy males participated in double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over pharmacological fMRI studies. All subjects underwent two fMRI sessions, separated by two weeks, receiving THC (6 mg) or placebo using a Volcano vaporizer. Effects of THC administration on brain function and task performance were assessed using different cognitive tasks. The first study included a memory task that consisted of separate encoding and recall conditions. Findings suggest involvement of the endocannabinoid system in encoding of information. In addition, recall activity was increased, which may be a compensatory mechanism to maintain normal levels of task performance. In the second study, subjects performed a Sternberg item-recognition task with increasing difficulty. After THC administration, a profile of working memory load, task performance and brain activity was shown that corresponds with current concepts of working memory inefficiency, and that resembles that of schizophrenia patients. In the third study, task performance on an executive function task (CPT-IP) was impaired after THC administration. This was associated with reduced deactivation in the default mode network, whereas activity in brain regions activated by the task was unaffected. These results suggest a role for the eCB system in executive function through modulation of the default mode network, which may be a common brain system that is affected in a broad range of psychiatric disorders. The fourth study included an emotional processing task. THC administration reduced both task performance and brain activity for negative emotions, without effects on processing of positive emotions. This indicates that THC administration changed emotional bias in healthy subjects, mainly reflected in decreased reactivity towards negative stimuli, which may suggest a role of the eCB system in symptoms of depression. Together, these results provide compelling support for endocannabinoid involvement in the control of higher cognitive functions. In addition, similarities in brain function between healthy volunteers after THC administration and psychiatric patients provide indirect evidence for possible involvement of the endocannabinoid system in psychiatric disorders. With these results, the endocannabinoid system becomes a promising candidate for novel therapies to target symptoms in psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia or depression.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death in the Netherlands. By the year 2030 it will be the leading cause of death in all parts of the world, including third world countries. Therefore, it is essential to improve diagnostic tools and continue research into the development of these diseases. Two themes are addressed in this thesis: magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of atherosclerosis and cardiac imaging in heart failure and myocardial infarcts. In the first part of this thesis research has been focused on the evaluation of new MRI contrast agents in mice to identify atherosclerotic lesions which are at risk to cause serious events. The dangerous, rupture-prone atherosclerotic plaques can cause heart attacks or strokes. When these rupture-prone atherosclerotic plaques are located and identified in an early phase patients can be treated earlier and events might be prevented. In an additional study we worked at the identification of different components which are present in atherosclerotic plaques in the carotid arteries in humans. With the 7 Tesla MRI scanner it is possible to image the brain and atherosclerotic plaque in a high resolution. Hopefully, this 7 Tesla MRI scanner can be used to identify rupture-prone atherosclerotic lesions in carotid arteries without the need of contrast agents. In the second part of this thesis research was performed in mice which suffered from a myocardial infarction or diastolic heart failure. First a new method was evaluated to perform cardiac function measurements with MRI in small rodents. This self-gating method makes the need for ECG-electrodes obsolete and therefore gives more reliable and faster results. Cardiac function assessment in mice is used to determine effectiveness of new medications and could lead to new or improved treatments in patients in the future. In a different study we studied heart failure, diastolic failure in diabetic mice. Patients suffering from diabetes can develop disturbed ventricular filling patterns, diastolic heart failure. Diastolic heart failure may lead to systolic heart failure and pulmonary edema, however in the early phase no clinical symptoms are present. The early detection of diastolic heart failure is essential to start treatment early on and prevent further deterioration of cardiac function. The study showed that in diabetic mice early detection of diastolic failure was possible with a high temporal resolution MRI scan, even before the mice developed systolic heart failure and cardiac hypertrophy.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Allergy is an exaggerated immune reaction to usually harmless foreign proteins present in food and airborne pollens for example. Allergic hypersensitivity can be subdivided in IgE- and non-IgE-mediated allergies. A critical role for mast cells is extensively described for IgE-mediated allergies, but evidence for their role in non-IgE mediated allergies is convincing as well. IgE can bind antigen with high affinity and crosslinking of mast cell-bound IgE by multivalent antigen causes mast cell activation leading to the release of multiple inflammatory mediators. These mediators initiate or contribute to the persistence of an inflammatory response. Despite this important contribution of IgE in many allergies, many patients (up to 40%) suffer from a non-IgE-mediated allergy (e.g. in food allergy). What causes mast cell activation in patients suffering from this type of allergies or other disorders in which mast cells play an important role? Besides IgE, immunoglobulin free light chains (FLCs) can mediate antigen-specific mast cell activation. A number of studies have indicated a possible functional role of (antigen-specific) FLCs in preclinical models of contact hypersensitivity, cow’s milk allergy, and asthma. The main focus of this thesis is to gain more insight in the production, presence, distribution, and putative functional role of FLCs in different human disorders. Upper and lower airway disorders were studied by analyzing the presence of FLCs in allergic rhinitis and nonallergic rhinitis patients, chronic rhinosinusitis with and without nasal polyposis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. In all disorders, most apparent increases in FLC concentrations were observed at local sites of inflammation. Furthermore, part of the FLC-positive cells in nasal mucosa of rhinitis patients showed to be mast cells supporting a mast cell-mediated effect of FLCs. Extremely high FLC concentrations were found at local sites of inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, and FLC concentrations showed to correlate with disease severity. In addition, FLC concentrations only significantly decreased in patients that responded to B cell depletion therapy (anti-CD20). Moreover, the abundant presence of FLCs within human cancer tissues of different organs and aetiologies was found, and this showed to be associated with poor clinical outcome in breast cancer patients. In a preclinical melanoma model it was shown that tumour growth was highly dependent on the presence of both FLCs and mast cells. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that FLCs bind to human basophils and that cross-linking of FLCs modulates IgE-mediated basophil activation. Finally, it is demonstrated that FLCs monomers and dimers might be secreted as distinct entities. FLC dimers showed to have a significantly higher antigen-specific binding affinity compared to FLC monomers. In conclusion, current knowledge on the biological activity of FLCs obtained in in vitro research, and preclinical and clinical studies suggests that FLCs possibly affect multiple cell types, including mast cells and basophils, in physiological and pathological conditions. Considering the described pro-inflammatory effects of FLCs, it would be interesting to investigate the therapeutic value of FLC antagonists (such as F991) in further detail.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy at ultra-high field in humans'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['MR spectroscopy (MRS) has gained an important place in fundamental research as well as in clinical research. In vivo MR spectroscopy provides a unique window to measure the concentration of chemical compounds (metabolites) inside the human body without the need for a chirurgical intervention or puncture. It obviates the need for tissue excisions or biopsies and provides direct tissue biomarkers, rather than indirect parameters derived from blood, plasma or urine samples. MR signals from tissue volumes of less than 1 ml and metabolite concentrations below 1 mM can be detected. Therefore MR spectroscopy is applicable to study normal and pathological metabolism inside the human body. However, for many research purposes and especially for clinical practice, the sensitivity and specificity of the MRS measurement is still a limiting factor. The sensitivity is limited by the low concentrations in the body, which make it difficult to detect these signals above the noise. This puts a restriction on the spatial resolution that can be obtained and leads to long measurement times. Also the specificity of MR spectroscopy is often a limiting factor, as the spectral resolution is not much higher than the difference in chemical dispersion between some resonances. The overlap in the MR spectrum between different compounds makes it hard to separately detect metabolites. For example, the resonances of glutamate and glutamine show significant overlap, and are difficult to detect individually. The recent development of ultra-high field magnets for human use offers a platform where both the sensitivity and the specificity of MRS are substantially increased. The intrinsic signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the MRS measurements increases approximately linear with the static magnetic field strength. MR experiments at a field strength of 7 tesla therefore show a more than twofold increase in the intrinsic SNR, as compared to a 3T MR scanner. In addition, the chemical shift separation between resonances is increased, leading to a more reliable discrimination between metabolites in the MR spectrum. These two effects show potential for a next step in the evolution of in vivo MR spectroscopy. Before the increased sensitivity and specificity can be utilized in practice, several technical impediments will have to be overcome when performing MRS in the human body at ultra-high field. The most important challenges that ultra-high field MRS applications impose are the decreased homogeneity in the static magnetic field (B0) and the transmit field (B1), a demand for higher gradient strengths, altered relaxation times and an increased power deposition in the body. This theses describes several studies and new methods to counter these challenges, and shows how high quality MRS data can be acquired at ultra-high field in humans.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Introduction Medication adherence can be subdivided into drug initiation, drug taking compliance and (non)persistence. Objective of this thesis was to (1) investigate whether measurement methods and reporting of adherence influenced outcomes, (2) predict poor drug taking compliance and nonpersistence from historical dispensing data and patient beliefs. Methods To answer objective (1) a systematic review and meta-(regression)-analysis was done to investigate whether reporting of adherence, measurement methods and different definitions and cutoff values influenced adherence. In a retrospective cohort study we investigated the influence of four exposure outcome combinations on persistence. To answer objective (2) we undertook two database studies investigating whether historical dispensing data and therapeutic complexity predicted poor drug taking compliance. Second, we performed a prospective cohort study, investigating patient beliefs, using the Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ) and Satisfaction on Information about Medicines Scale (SIMS). These questionnaires were sent at the start of therapy and after one month. We used the answers to individual questions to construct a predictive model for nonpersistence. Results Both drug taking compliance and persistence were better if studies reported both outcomes, compared with reporting only drug taking compliance or (non)persistence. Self reported adherence was better than assessment of adherence using databases. Different definitions and cutoff values exist which are very likely to influence adherence outcomes. Accounting for supplies from previous dispensings was associated with better persistence, but differences seized to exist at gap lengths (period without medication available) of 90 days or longer. Long-term poor drug taking compliance was predicted by short-term poor drug taking compliance using a predictive model. The model increased efficiency in screening patients for poor drug taking compliance (Number Needed to Screen: 5). Nonpersistence could not be predicted from therapeutic complexity, although different predictors in multivariable analysis were statistically significant. We found early changes in attitudes towards chronic medication based on the BMQ-specific questionnaire. Compared to accepting patients (high necessity and low concern scores), skeptical patients (low necessity and high concerns scores) showed an almost seven times increased risk for nonpersistence after one month. A predictive model for nonpersistence was developed, using individual questions from the BMQ and SIMS with a high negative predictive value. Conclusions Adherence should be reported as both poor drug taking compliance and nonpersistence to obtain more reliable and comparable data. It is recommended that definitions for drug taking compliance should be standardized and preferentially both MPR and PDC to increase comparability with other studies. Gaps should be sufficiently long and cutoff values to classify poor drug taking compliance should be based on forgiveness of the drug. If short gaps are of clinical importance, supplies from previous dispensings should be accounted for. Historical dispensing data are probably not useful for the prediction of poor drug taking compliance and nonpersistence. We recommend that patient beliefs should be used and discussed with the patient during the early course of therapy, because during this period, the patient does a cost-benefit analysis and an intervention to increase adherence is expected to be most beneficial during this period'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Persistence of infectious agents in populations is an important issue in epidemiology. It is often assumed that spatial fragmentation of a population of hosts, in a so-called metapopulation, increases the probability of persistence of the infectious agents, and that increased movement of hosts between patches, i.e. increased connectivity between the subpopulations, is beneficial for this. In the first part of this thesis, a stochastic model is used that describes both within- and between-patch dynamics and explicitly models movement of the hosts. It is shown that the relation between persistence of the infectious agents and the movement of hosts is less straightforward than previously thought. As a concrete example, the persistence of the plague bacterium Yersinia pestis is studied in a metapopulation of great gerbils in Kazakhstan. In the second part, the concept of the invasion indicator Rm , an analogy to Ro specifically adapted for metapopulations, is introduced to determine whether an infectious agent can successfully invade a metapopulation. This invasion indicator is then used to determine whether a mutant-infectious agent can invade a population and successfully replace the resident-infectious agent. This is a relevant problem for the evolution of infectious disease agents in spatially fragmented populations of hosts.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Evidence-based medicine refers to the conscientious, explicit and judicious use of the current best evidence to support decision making at point of care. To facilitate the transition of evidence into daily practice several evidence-based otorhinolaryngology guidelines have been developed. In this thesis we first describe a survey among Dutch otorhinolaryngologists to study their current awareness, knowledge, and opinion of these evidence based guidelines since clinical uptake of guidelines is of high importance. Our results show that Dutch otorhinolaryngologists are familiar with the available guidelines and a majority uses them in daily practice. Most choose treatment consistent with the guideline. The lack of strict recommendations in guidelines can be difficult to use directive, but it also gives room for flexibility and preferences of doctors and patients when selecting treatment. Since guidelines have such a prominent role in clinical practice, it is important that recommendations in these guidelines are formulated in the same systematic and transparent way, based on the best available evidence. If different guidelines are substantiated from similar scientific studies, they will generate similar conclusions and corresponding recommendations. However, in a comparative study between English (SIGN) Dutch (CBO) and American (ICSI) guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), we come to the conclusion that these guidelines focus on different aspects of the management of OSAHS. Furthermore, for similar clinical questions these 3 guidelines showed conflicting conclusions (11%-18%), differences in attached levels of evidence (32%-63%), and remarkable discrepancies in cited studies. A plausible explanation for these differences is the citation preference for papers from members of the guideline work group and from own country. Despite different publication dates, more recent guidelines fail to cite earlier published guidelines. Despite the generally accepted approach regarding the development of Evidence Based guidelines, remarkable differences exist between guidelines from different countries on the same clinical subject. At last, we emphasize the potential additive value of Evidence Based Case Reports (EBCR’s) to earlier reported limitations of the current evidence based guideline development. An EBCR starts with a knowledge gap identified in daily practice regarding diagnosis, prognosis, or interventions. An explicit and transparent approach is followed, and practical best evidence summaries are provided that are applicable to specific patient management issues. EBCR’s may play a role in guideline development since evidence is transparently separated from judgement. EBCR’s can be used to assist guideline panel consensus sessions. An apparent definition of knowledge gaps and a formal system for rating the evidence can be used. Subsequently, recommendations can be progressively formed by the guideline panel using a considered judgement approach during a group decision making process, instead of being based on so-called “expert discussion”. Furthermore, EBCR’s can also be used in the formation or adjustment of local diagnostic and treatment protocols, and assist in developing interactive media, to further improve evidence and guidelines in otorhinolaryngology'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The gut is an important organ for the immune system. Microbes and immune cells interact directly or via epithelial cells. Both TH17 and Treg cells mature in this environment. The composition of the microbiota has an important influence on the immune homeostasis. Influencing the immune system via the microbiota has been a challenge for scientist and clinicians for several decades. Especially atopic disorders like asthma and eczema have been subject to prophylactic trials with probiotics, with disappointing results however. We hypothesized an important role for bacterial species in the immune regulating effect of probiotics. We tested a large number of gut derived lactic acid bacterial strains for there in vitro immune regulating properties using several techniques. All known subsets of CD4+ T cells (TH1, TH2, TH17 and regulatory T cells) could be induced by these bacteria, showing that probiotics can direct the immune system in different directions. These findings show that careful selection of a strain prior to clinical application is needed in order to select the appropriate strain for an immunological purpose. Some strains show to be potent inducers of functional FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Treg). These Treg are induced de novo from CD25- T cells, without a dependency on IL-10. The effect of strains showed to be donor dependent, which implies that different strains will be beneficial for each individual. The effect of probiotic supplementation has been shown by others to be most effective early in life. We hypothesized that the neonatal naive immune system is more prone to produce Treg than the adult counterpart, resulting in immune regulation rather than immune activation. In order to test this, we compared cord blood (CB) and adult peripheral blood (APB) derived naive T cells after activation with anti-CD3. Indeed, CB T cells became FOXP3+ more easily than APB T cells. This effect was critically dependent on the interaction between antigen presenting cells (APC) and T cells; removal of APC from the cultures reduced the effect. Moreover, blockade of the interaction between the molecules programmed death (PD)-1 and its ligand PD-L1 expressed by T cells and APC respectively significantly reduced the induction (of differentiation to) of FOXP3+ Treg. The ability to differentiate into TH17 cells is affected in CB as well; anti-CD3 activation of APB cells induced IL-17 producing T cells, but CB cells were unable to do so. Interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and IL-23 are known to positively influence the induction of TH17 cells; addition of these cytokines resulted in more IL-17 production by APB cells, but had no effect on CB cells. Nevertheless, FOXP3+ cell number in CB cell cultures was reduced by these cytokines. This finding shows that another factor affects the possibility of naive T cells to differentiate in either an inflammatory TH17 cell or a regulatory Treg. This T cell intrinsic factor could show to be a future target for directing the immune system towards inflammation or regulation'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['It was the aim of this thesis to perform a meta-analysis of published trial on FECG monitoring during labor, to assess its effects on fetal outcome, on the use of FBS, and on instrumental and operative interventions. Furthermore we conducted secondary studies of published data sets to address thus far unresolved issues, such as: are the consensus-based recommendations for additional fetal information effective in preventing fetal acidosis; what is the association between the baseline T/QRS of the FECG (i.e. the T/QRS at the beginning of a recording) and fetal outcome; are biphasic events of the FECG associated with adverse neonatal outcome; what is the effect of maternal fever on the FECG complex; and what is the effect of maternal epidural analgesia on the FECG complex. The first chapter of this thesis describes a meta-analysis comparing ST-waveform analysis of the fetal ECG in combination with cardiotocography (STAN) with continuous cardiotocography alone for several neonatal and maternal outcomes. In this meta-analysis, STAN failed to show a significant reduction in the incidence of metabolic acidosis. Although the meta-analysis did show a significant reduction in the incidence of operative vaginal deliveries with an unaltered incidence of cesarean deliveries. Instrumental vaginal deliveries were reduced with 12% when using STAN. In addition, the meta-analysis showed a 40% reduction in the need for additional fetal blood sampling (FBS) when using STAN in comparison to conventional CTG. The second part of this thesis therefore elaborates on the STAN guidelines and on its recommendations for additional fetal blood sampling. We showed that FBS performed according to these criteria revealed acidosis (defined as pH'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The therapeutic value of various targeted nanomedicines was evaluated in several inflammatory disorders, including cancer, while exploring which nanocarrier may be most suitable for a specific therapeutic application. First, an overview of drug targeting systems presently available for anti-inflammatory therapy was given. Then, the thesis fell apart in three sections: two sections diverging the therapeutic scope of several novel and established targeted nanomedicines to various inflammatory diseases and cancer, and a final section to bring these and other efforts together in the quest for the ‘optimal’ nanomedicine for a given application. The first section dealt with the preclinical evaluation of targeted dexamethasone-containing carriers in three different models of inflammatory disease. On the one hand, the therapeutic activity of dexamethasone encapsulated into the aqueous core of long-circulating liposomes was studied in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model for multiple sclerosis (MS), as well as in mice with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis, a model for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Interestingly, the targeted delivery of dexamethasone using long-circulating liposomes was therapeutically efficacious in preclinical models of RA and MS, but not in IBD. On the other hand, a dexamethasone-delivery system based on core-crosslinked polymeric micelles demonstrated strong therapeutic efficacy in two preclinical models of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The second section focused on the development of new nanomedicines derived from colchicine with vascular disrupting activity. The synthesis, liposomal encapsulation and in vitro characterization of two polymeric prodrugs of colchicine were described, and one of these prodrugs was selected for preclinical evaluation in tumor-bearing mice, to demonstrate a highly efficacious in vivo vascular disrupting activity of this new type of colchicine-derivatives. As part of the third and last section, which addressed the application-oriented search for an optimal nanocarrier system for drug targeting, three different nanocarriers of dexamethasone were evaluated in a comparative study to assess their therapeutic efficacy in two animal models of RA, providing deeper insights in the therapeutic efficacy of each of the systems. Then, to allow for the screening of different nanomedicines without requiring extensive usage of laboratory animals, an in vitro assay for predicting the in vivo circulation kinetics of liposomes was presented.

       "  'Description': [\"Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common and often potentially life threatening disease. Severe morbidity and mortality can be prevented if PE is diagnosed and treated in time. CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) has emerged as an effective method for diagnosis of PE, but interpreting a CTPA is complicated by the size of the image date set, the various PE look-alikes and also human factors such as experience and attention span. In this thesis, we therefore evaluated the performance of a computer-assisted detection (CAD) prototype for the detection of pulmonary embolism (PE) to help radiologists detect PE. The first part of this thesis summarises the latest technical development of CT scanners, the new challenges for protocol design associated with these new techniques and the options offered by new processing and evaluation tools. In the second part the standalone performance of a CAD prototype is described in 278 CTPA scans that had been consecutively obtained during night and weekend shifts. The CAD performance was compared with a reference standard obtained by consensus of three readers and with the reports made after acquisition of the clinical scans. The results suggested that CAD can help to find subtle isolated segmental and subsegmental emboli and to exclude PE. Furthermore, we found that image quality parameters and thus scanning protocosl effect the standalone performance more than scanner type, using 240 CTPA scans in 3 different hospitals. In the third part of this thesis we tested if CAD has indeed an impact on the performance of readers. Per study set up we used 6 readers with varying radiological experience to analyse the effect of CAD when CAD was used as a second or as a concurrent reader. Using CAD as a second reader in 209 CTPA scans, we showed an increase in readers' confidence and sensitivity without loss of specificity. Similarly as seen in the second part, we found the greatest impact of CAD on the detection of small segmental and subsegmental emboli. However, these results came with an increase of reading time, which is undesirable in clinical practice. When we tested CAD as a concurrent reader in 196 CTPA scans, we found that readers' sensitivity improved or remained at the same level and readers' confidence increased compared to the readings without CAD, but with a significant shorter reading time. In summary, CAD has the potential to aid readers to find patients with isolated segmental and/or subsegmental emboli, to reassure readers in excluding PE and to decrease reading time. However, before making CAD available for broader application in clinical practice, its impact on readers' decisions and patient outcome needs to be studied in a larger prospective trial.\"],\n",

There is sometimes focus on increasing the quantity of motivation, but the how and why need more evidence. The aims of this thesis were to gather insights and investigate medical students’ motivation, particularly the importance of quality of motivation, factors influencing and outcomes and to explore how these can be applied to make medical education better suited to support motivation. The main research questions were: 1. Is motivation a predictor for learning and academic performance in medical students? 2. What factors affect motivation? 3. How can intrinsic motivation be stimulated among students? Methods The literature on development of medical education curricula was reviewed to explore whether these developments were geared towards stimulating student motivation. The literature was also reviewed to determine how motivation was investigated as a dependent and an independent variable in medical education. The validity of a scale (Strength of Motivation for Medical School) to measure the strength of motivation for medical school was investigated. Two research studies investigated motivation as an independent variable, the relationships of student motivation with their learning strategies and efforts and their academic performance were investigated through structural equation modeling analysis and cluster analysis. An approach towards investigating motivation, which combined quantity and quality of motivation, was proposed. As a dependent variable the relationships of age, maturity, gender and educational background with motivation were investigated through multiple regression analysis. Applications of this research were described and recommendations were made. Results 1.Developments in medical education appear to have undervalued student motivation. 2. Motivation is an independent variable in medical education and intrinsic motivation is significantly associated with deep study strategy, high study effort and good academic performance. 3. Motivation is also a dependent variable in medical education and is significantly affected by age, maturity, gender, educational background, intrinsic motivation is specifically enhanced by providing students autonomy, feedback about competence and emotional support.4. Strength of motivation for medical school can be reliably measured by Strength of Motivation for Medical School questionnaire. Discussion Student motivation has been given low consideration in medical education as indicated by the gap in the literature on this topic. Medical curricula have undergone major reforms, but these reforms are not geared towards enhancing student motivation. An approach towards studying motivation in medical students is to give importance to both, the quality and quantity of motivation. Intrinsic motivation (learning for the sake of learning) as compared to extrinsic motivation (learning for reward), leads to better learning and performance. Intrinsic motivation can be enhanced by providing students with autonomy in learning, feedback on their performance and emotional support. Conclusions It is important to give consideration to motivation among medical students because intrinsic motivation leads to better learning and performance and because it can be enhanced by providing autonomy, feedback and emotional support to students'],\n",

       "  'Description': [\"In order to successfully execute our actions in daily life, it is beneficial to focus on specific features of the incoming visual information. 'Action-modulated perception' refers to the process of enhancing action-relevant perceptual features during the preparation of an action. For instance, when preparing to grasp an object, action-relevant features of the object (orientation, size) will be enhanced. Similarly, when preparing an eye movement, the intended target location will be enhanced. If the visual system is made 'ready' to better process relevant parts of the incoming visual information, the execution of the intended action will improve. The research presented in this thesis focuses on the effects of action preparation on perception, and its implementation in the brain. This was studied in both the oculomotor and skeletomotor system. The time course of events during eye movement preparation was studied using electro-encephalography (EEG). Early frontal activity was found, followed later by occipital activity, contralateral to the eye movement direction. The amplitudes of the early frontal (likely the frontal eye fields, FEF) and late occipital activity were significantly correlated, indicating that the early FEF activity may drive spatial attention shifts by means of top-down feedback projections to the early visual areas during eye movement preparation. Using the same saccade task, single pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was applied to the FEF during eye movement preparation. This enhanced spatial attention at the eye movement end point, when applied shortly after the go-signal and contralateral to the eye movement direction. This indicates that it is the early FEF activity that may drive top-down feedback to the visual areas, modulating perception at the location to which an eye movement is being prepared. The second part of the thesis demonstrates the effect of action-modulated perception for grasping actions. In a behavioral study, subjects were better able to detect changes in the orientation of a bar that was to be grasped, rather than pointed to. This paradigm was used to investigate the role of the anterior intraparietal area (AIP) in mediating action-modulated perception. AIP, a visuomotor area involved in grasping planning and execution, was stimulated during action preparation. This disrupted the increase in orientation sensitivity with grasping preparation over pointing preparation. This shows that AIP is an essential component in establishing action-modulated perception for grasping actions and implicates AIP as a source of top-down feedback to the early visual areas. This perceptual effect of grasping preparation was further investigated using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and multivoxel pattern analysis techniques (MVPA). Subjects performed grasping and pointing actions in the 7T MRI scanner. Results show that the action in preparation can be reliably predicted from activity in early visual areas, indicating that action preparation has a profound effect on early visual processing. In this thesis, two important areas have been identified that contribute to the enhancement of action-relevant perceptual features during action preparation. Taken together, this suggests that the preparation of an action modulates action relevant features through top-down feedback connections, enabling action-modulated perception.\"],\n",

Our results provide new insights into the limbic upregulation and prefrontal downregulation of defensive states. We delineated neuroanatomical systems that may play an important role in fear regulation in response to the on- and offset of acute stressors. We extended work that implicated common genetic variation in serotonin transporter function as a possible prelude to anxiety by showing that serotonin transporter genotype is associated with basic defensive reactivity as indexed by fear-potentiated startle and functional magnetic resonance imaging measures of anxiety. We made first steps in the development of paradigms that may aid in the discovery of new and improved medication for anxiety disorders. Finally, we performed fear-potentiated startle measurements in two very rare populations: subjects with a rare genetic defect leading to selective calcification of the lateral amygdala and subjects that received deep brain stimulation at the ventral striatum to treat severe obsessive-compulsive symptoms. The latter two studies enabled us to obtain unique information on the contribution of these brain regions to fear learning and basic defensive reactions.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['In this research, several block copolymers were synthesized and characterized with regard to possible pharmaceutical applications. All block copolymers were thermosensitive and self-assembled at 37 °C into structures like micelles and hydrogels, which can be used for innovative drug delivery purposes. Some of the synthesized polymers were biohybrid, in the sense that they contained peptide segments which enabled their cleavage by enzymes that are upregulated in diseased tissues. First, methods were explored for the synthesis of polymer (bio)conjugates. One suitable and popular reaction for synthesizing such conjugates is the copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition ‘click’ reaction. A novel method was developed to introduce a reactive azide functionality on polymers after their synthesis by Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization (ATRP). The newly developed reaction is catalyzed by the ATRP copper catalyst and can be followed by a ‘click’ conjugation reaction using again the same catalyst. Another, relatively new, method to synthesize polymer bioconjugates is to grow a polymer from a peptide or protein. In this research, a peptide containing an enzymatic cleavage site for the tumor-associated matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) 2 and 9 was functionalized at its C-terminus with an ATRP initiator, followed by the polymerization of a hydrophilic polymer block, poly(oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl ether metharcrylate).Then, another ATRP initiator was conjugated to the N-terminus of the peptide followed by the polymerization of a thermosensitive block, poly(N-isopropylacrylamide). At 37 °C in water, all polymers formed micelles with a favorable size for drug delivery purposes. It was shown that the coronas of the micelles could be cleaved off enzymatically. This system may function as a long-circulating drug delivery vehicle with enzyme-triggered destabilization in the target tissue to release e.g. a cytotoxic payload. Subsequently, a study of the physico-chemical differences between ‘star-like’ micelles and ‘flower-like micelles’ was performed. Star-like micelles are formed from amphiphilic diblock copolymers, whereas flower-like micelles are formed from triblock copolymers that consist of two hydrophobic blocks separated by a hydrophilic block. Both Static Light Scattering and 1H NMR T2 relaxation measurements indicated that hydrophilic polymer blocks in flower-like micelles are less flexible than in star-like micelles. The last part of this research focused on a particular property of flower-like micelles, namely the fact that at high concentration they are in equilibrium with a hydrogel. When a thermosensitive triblock copolymer hydrogel was brought into water, flower-like micelles were released. When the hydrogel was pre-loaded with the cytostatic drug paclitaxel, this was co-released with the micelles. The system was tested in a tumor xenograft mouse model: paclitaxel-loaded hydrogels were injected i.p., after which paclitaxel was slowly released and could be measured in the circulation for two days. Furthermore, the released paclitaxel was able to inhibit tumor growth for at least three weeks'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The research performed for this thesis focused at strategies to improve bone graft substitutes for future clinical applicability. We started by investigating the value of cell based tissue engineered constructs. First we showed that at the ectopic location, bone formation was only present when BLI signal was present until the end of the implantation period, indicating that living MSCs were necessary for bone formation. By immunohistochemistry we showed, that the implanted MSCs were present in the newly formed bone as bone cell. For the spinal fusion location the question whether the implanted MSCs contribute to the bone regeneration remained unanswered. Next, we created hybrid constructs by using allogeneic MSCs as off-the-shelf components, and showed their effectivity in goat models both at the ectopic as well as the orthotopic location. Before allogeneic MSCs can be used in clinical practice further studies need to be performed to analyze safety in man. In other studies performed in goats we found that location has great influence on the effectiveness of MSCs. They show an additive value in enhancing bone formation at the ectopic location, e.g. in rats, but at the orthotopic location this beneficial effect is only present during the first few weeks, and not after implantation of 3-4 months. From this we can conclude that MSC seeding is not necessary for bone formation at clinically relevant orthotopic locations. Furthermore, early EPCs were coseeded with MSC to stimulate vasculogenesis, which is a prerequisite for osteogenesis. We found that in spite of the positive effect that both cell types (MSCs and EPCs) exerted on proliferation of the other in vitro, co-seeding of MSCs and EPCs did not improve bone formation. Bone-marrow-derived EPCs alone did reveal enhanced bone formation as compared to control implants without cells. The second aspect of this thesis emphasized on construct optimization, involving material improvement and investigation of bioactives. PLG, containing growth factors, was used in three studies in combination with (allogeneic) MSCs and EPCs to enhance bone formation. Results were highly variable, which was also reported in animal and human studies in the literature, making PLG in our current opinion an unreliable component for bone tissue engineering purposes. Next, the value of timing of sequentially released BMP-2 and VEGF was analyzed at ectopic and orthotopic sites in dogs. A positive effect of growth factors on bone formation was seen at both locations, which is in agreement with reports from literature. With respect to timing of the growth factors, we were the first to show that a differential timing of dual VEGF and BMP-2 delivery did not influence orthotopic bone regeneration, whereas at the ectopic site early release of BMP-2 significantly enhanced bone formation. Finally we performed an instrumented posterolateral fusion, using a new TCP, and demonstrated that the cell-free TCP constructs and MSC-seeded TCP implants performed not different from autograft, implying a future role for osteoinductive materials such as the TCP for spinal fusion. From preclinical studies we conclude that cell seeding is almost never needed in bone regeneration.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) patients, particularly patients on dialysis, often experience difficulties with participating in daily activities, including paid work. Restrictions on the quantity or quality of activities, may impede people’ perceived autonomy and self-esteem. This thesis addressed the question why some patients with CKD succeed in keeping high levels of autonomy and self-esteem, and maintaining paid employment, whereas others do not, and focused on psychological factors considered relevant for patients’ functioning. The research examined to what extent (pre-) dialysis patients feel autonomous, experience self-esteem, and perform paid work, and to what extent variation in therein can be explained from differences in illness and treatment perceptions and experienced social support. Cross-sectional data from 109 pre-dialysis patients, and cross-sectional and longitudinal data from 166 dialysis patients were used. A further aim was to develop and pilot test a psychological intervention for patients and their partners, aimed at supporting participation in daily activities – including paid work – and perceived autonomy and self-esteem. Patients’ average autonomy levels were only moderate; the average self-esteem levels were rather high. Labour participation among dialysis patients was low, and results suggest that pre-dialysis patients already resign from paid jobs. Multiple regression analyses (controlled for background characteristics) demonstrated that illness and treatment perceptions explained a substantial amount of variance in autonomy and self-esteem (17 to 27%). On the whole, patients who perceive high personal control over the illness, little impact of the illness and treatment on daily life, and little concern about the illness, reported higher levels of perceived autonomy and self-esteem. Perceptions were not associated with employment, though trends were observed. By means of pooled-cross sectional analyses (controlled for background characteristics and dependency of multiple observations within individuals), it was investigated whether patients’ perceptions vary across the illness trajectory, i.e. depend on dialysis duration and type of treatment in (pre-) dialysis patients; vary across an 8-month interval in dialysis patients. Results suggest that illness and treatment perceptions - relevant for patients’ outcomes - vary across the CKD trajectory, and therefore offer starting points for altering these perceptions by means of an intervention. Next, the role of support was investigated, and whether the effects of support depend on patients’ perceptions of concern and personal control. Emotional support was solely positively related to autonomy in highly concerned patients. Overprotection was negatively associated with autonomy, and this association was stronger in patients high in personal control. Furthermore, a positive main effect of emotional support, and negative main effects of perceived lack of emotional support and overprotection on self-esteem were observed. Next, a psychological intervention was developed, based on theories of self-regulation, social learning and self-determination, and the empirical study results. The intervention was tested on feasibility and first experiences on a small scale. Findings were positive and suggest that a theory-driven multiple approach is feasible and possibly effective. Future research needs to investigate whether the developed intervention leads to fewer patients quitting daily activities (including jobs) and increased feelings of autonomy, both in the short term and in the long run.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Allogeneic haematopoeitic stem cell transplantation is a potentially curative treatment for a variety of diseases. Its use is limited by 1) the risk of graft failures and relapse of malignant diseases, 2) transplantation-associated complications, and 3) late effects. There is a large and largely unpredictable variability in outcomes of allogeneic haematopoeitic stem cell transplantation between children. Within a complex setting with a lot of variables, individualisation of the drug therapy in the conditioning regimen may improve the benefit - harm balance of pediatric allogeneic haematopoeitic stem cell transplantation. Busulfan is an alkalating antineoplastic agent which forms the backbone of most chemotherapy-based conditioning regimens and there is a large variability between children in exposures, in efficacy and toxicity of busulfan based-conditioning. The studies performed in this thesis focused on three items: 1) the association between exposure to busulfan (area under the concentration-time curve or route of administration) and clinical outcomes, 2) the relationship between dose and exposure to busulfan in neonates, infants, children and adolescents, 3) the association between biomarkers of immune reconstitution and clinical outcomes in sibling bone marrow, unrelated bone marrow, and unrelated cord blood transplantation.Our studies showed that therapeutic drug monitoring based dose-targeting of intravenous busulfan resulted in higher event-free survival and overall survival compared to un-targeted oral busulfan, but also to a higher incidence of toxicity (veno-occlusive disease). Intravenous busulfan exposure of a narrow window between 74 and 82 mg*h/L was optimal for the outcome parameter event-free survival. The pharmacokinetics of intravenous busulfan in neonates, children, adolescents and young adults, based on data from multiple international transplant centers, with body weights ranging between 3 and 100 kilograms, were best described on the basis of a 2-compartment model. A non-linear function was found to best describe the relationship between bodyweight and clearance, thereby explaining 65% of the observed variability in clearance between patients. The external validation showed that the model predicted busulfan concentrations in pediatric and young adult patients ranging between 3 and 86 kg without bias and with good precision, regardless of transplant center, underlying disease, ethnicity, body weight age or body mass index. This model forms the basis for individualized busulfan dosing. A study of biomarker – outcome relationship showed that the speed of immune reconstitution early after allogeneic haematopoeitic stem cell transplantation, and hence mortality, differed among recipients of matched sibling bone marrow, unrelated bone marrow and unrelated cord blood. Longitudinal biomarkers related to immune reconstitution, namely: the area under the CD4+ cell curve in the first 90 days and the occurrence of an early peak in CD4+ cell counts, were identified as early predictors of overall survival. The PK-related biomarkers (busulfan-exposure) and PD-related biomarkers (biomarkers of immune reconstitution) defined in this thesis can be implemented in clinical practice and form the basis of future PK-PD studies of other drugs in pediatric allo-HSCT such as ATG, fludarabine and new agents.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['During rest, a set of brain areas shows increased activity compared to when people are performing complex tasks. This network is commonly referred to as the default-mode network (DMN) and includes the ventral and dorsal medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex and lateral posterior cortices. Activity within these regions is highly correlated during resting-state and is thought to reflect self-referential processes important for social cognitive functioning.Abnormal functioning of the DMN is associated with various psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia. However, it is also suggested that activity and connectivity within the DMN is caused or confounded by non-neural noise such as cardiorespiratory processes. The aim of this thesis was to gain more insight in the function of the DMN in self-referential processing and social cognition using functional MRI. The first part of the thesis is focused on healthy volunteers, while the second part describes two studies in unaffected siblings of patients with schizophrenia. These siblings are at increased genetic risk of developing the disorder and exhibit difficulties in social functioning. In the first study of this thesis, we investigated whether resting-state and task-induced activity within the DMN could be explained by effects of cardiorespiratory processes. This study showed that activity within the DMN is highly interconnected during resting-state and cannot be explained by cardiorespiratory confounds alone. In the second study, the role of the DMN in self-referential processing was assessed by investigating connectivity and activity during a self-referential processing task. This study revealed increased activity during self-referential processing within the DMN in combination with decreased functional coupling between areas of the network, suggesting functional specialization within the DMN. After focusing on DMN function in healthy controls, the third study investigatedresting-state DMN connectivity in siblings of schizophrenia patients and whether this was related to the functioning of the network during self-referential processing. Compared with controls, siblings showed exaggerated connectivity during resting-state between the midline areas of the DMN and this was associated with aberrant interactions between these areas during self-referential processing. These findings suggest that the functional organization of the DMN is aberrant in subjects at increased risk of developing schizophrenia. Finally, the fourth study showed that the unaffected siblings exhibit abnormal activation within the DMN, the amygdala and hippocampus during another important aspect of social cognition, namely emotion processing. Together, the studies of this thesis confirmed that activity within the DMN reflects self-referential mental activity relevant for social cognitive functioning and does not merely reflect physiological noise. In addition, these studies suggest that the DMN is organized in highly interconnected but functionally specialized regions. Abnormalities within this organization of the DMN may contribute to difficulties in social cognitive functioning observed in schizophrenia'],\n",

       "  'Description': [\"Depression and cognitive impairment are highly prevalent in later life, and frequently co-occur. One of the possible mechanisms that may underlie both conditions is the presence of cerebral small-vessel disease. The presence of cerebral small-vessel disease is strongly associated with common vascular risk factors, and is characterized by white matter lesions and lacunar infarcts on brain MRI. The 'vascular depression' hypothesis proposes that disruption of emotion-regulating frontal-subcortical pathways is an underlying mechanism by which cerebral small-vessel disease may precipitate or predispose to late-life depression. In this thesis, we investigated the influence of cerebral small-vessel disease on MRI on depressive symptoms, cognitive performance and self-rated functioning in patients with atherosclerotic disease. Our major findings were that: 1) Poorer self-rated functioning is an independent risk factor for mortality in patients with atherosclerotic disease, and patients with lacunar infarcts are particularly vulnerable for the adverse effect of poorer self-rated mental functioning on mortality; 2) The influence of white matter lesions, infarcts and atrophy on depressive symptoms and cognitive performance depends on lesion location rather than on lesion severity. We found that subcortical infarcts in deep white matter tracts were associated with depressive symptoms, poorer executive functioning and memory. Periventricular white matter lesions, cortical infarcts and atrophy were associated with poorer executive functioning and slowed processing speed, but not with depressive symptoms; 3) The depressive symptoms associated with cerebral small-vessel disease in frontal and deep white matter tracts are primarily characterized by motivational problems and not by mood problems; 4) The motivational problems associated with cerebral small-vessel disease are also present in patients without major depression, suggesting that these may be expressions of 'vascular apathy' rather than 'vascular depression'; 5) In persons without dementia, apathy is related to both cerebral small-vessel disease and neurodegeneration, and may therefore also be an early manifestation of cognitive decline\"],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Transitional pharmaceutical care for patients discharged from the hospital'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Patients visit multiple healthcare providers, obtain medications from multiple pharmacies and transition between settings, all of which can lead to inaccurate medication information and thus medication errors. To improve continuity of care, transitional pharmaceutical care programs are needed. These programs incorporate medication reconciliation (i.e. obtaining and evaluating a complete medication overview), patient counselling regarding medication changes and information transfer between healthcare providers. Continuity of pharmaceutical care is especially important at hospital discharge as the patient needs to resume responsibility for his medication and other healthcare providers, e.g. general practitioner and community pharmacist, need to guide the patient after hospital discharge. The objective of this thesis was to summarise existing evidence on interventions regarding discharge medication and to develop and evaluate a transitional pharmaceutical care program, developed by the hospital pharmacy, with respect to effects and costs. Existing evidence was summarised in a systematic review. Various discharge medication related interventions were reported to be mainly effective for process measures; 75% of studies were effective for the outcome knowledge, 70% for adherence and 93% for DRPs. A limited number of studies reported effectiveness on morbidity; 18% for readmission and 40% for health services use. For the development of a transitional pharmaceutical care program the informational needs of general practitioners and patients regarding discharge medication, the additional contribution of patient participation in medication reconciliation, the labour costs versus the medication costs and the documentation of relevant discharge medication information by community pharmacies was assessed. General practitioners stated that discharge medication information was delayed. They desired information regarding the reasons for changes in the pharmacotherapy. Patients also expressed this need. Furthermore, patients expressed variable needs, e.g. regarding side-effects, so information at discharge should be tailored to individual needs. Patient participation was essential during medication reconciliation as discharge prescriptions were adjusted frequently after patient counselling due to discrepancies in use or need of drug therapy. The adjustments made by the hospital pharmacy resulted in higher medication cost savings after hospital discharge than the costs related to the net time investment (€56 savings per patient). However, continuity of pharmaceutical care after hospital discharge was shown to fail in the majority of community pharmacies as relevant discharge medication information (e.g. allergies/medication changes) was not documented in computer systems. The transitional pharmaceutical care program COACH (Continuity Of Appropriate pharmacotherapy, patient Counselling and information transfer in Healthcare) was evaluated in 365 patients versus 341 usual care patients. For all patients in the COACH program, interventions were performed to prevent drug-related problems (mean number of interventions: 10 per patient). Examples of interventions included re-starting of pre-admission prescribed medication, adjusting dosing schemes due to kidney malfunction and discontinuing redundant medication. Patients were significantly more satisfied with counselling provided by a hospital pharmacy member compared to the resident (69% resident versus 87% pharmacy). The COACH program did not decrease all-cause unplanned rehospitalisations. Further research will show whether medication-related rehospitalisations are decreased. A cost-effectiveness study showed that the COACH program was not considered cost-effective, although costs were 1000 euro less per patient for the COACH program.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The new paradigm in cancer treatment that aims to inhibit the smoldering inflammatory response in tumors is explored to develop new anticancer treatments. It appears that targeted drug delivery is essential in this concept as high local levels of anti-inflammatory agents are needed to observe the beneficial effects of inflammation inhibition. An overview of classes of anti-inflammatory drugs and drug delivery systems that so far have been studied to treat cancer-inflammation is given. This thesis falls apart in two sections: the first section studies and evaluates the antitumor efficacy of targeted glucocorticoids, whereas the second part focuses on the development and preclinical evaluation of antitumor effects of different anti-inflammatory compounds encapsulated in long-circulating liposomes. In the first section, it is shown that the antitumor effects of liposomal prednisolone phosphate are not limited to tumor-graft models since this potent anti-inflammatory nanomedicine also inhibits tumor growth in a spontaneous mouse tumor model (which more closely resembles the slow progressive chronic inflammatory human disease). When the glucocorticoids is targeted to tumors with core-crosslinked polymeric micelles, the observed antitumor effects do not differ substantially compared to long-circulating liposomes, however the versatility of the polymeric system on drug release profile may assist on the optimization of glucocorticoids release for maximal antitumor effect. In the second section of this thesis, liposomal formulations of different natural (resveratrol, caffeic acid, pterostilbene, carvacrol, etc) or synthetic (pravastatin) anti-inflammatory compounds were developed, characterized and evaluated for antitumor efficacy. Interestingly, only targeted nanomedicines of multi-targeted and potent anti-inflammatory compounds seem to induce antitumor effects in experimental tumor models. The targeted delivery of anti-inflammatory drugs to tumors as anticancer strategy is more complex that foreseen at the outset of these studies and involves several critical factors that have been pinpointed with these studies. Finally, the findings presented in this thesis and suggestions for future work are discussed in a final summarizing discussion.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Today’s children and adolescents have a much higher prevalence of overweight than the generation of their parents had in their childhood. The prevalence of asthma symptoms has also increased at the end of the last century and associations between overweight and asthma have been convincingly shown in previous research. The increase in childhood and adolescent overweight might enhance the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases or earlier onset of cardiovascular disorders and the same can be hypothesized for lung diseases. The Prevention and Incidence of Asthma and Mite Allergy (PIAMA) study enables the study of associations between childhood overweight on the one hand and respiratory health and early indicators of cardiovascular health in adult life on the other hand. 3963 children participate in this prospective birth cohort study with yearly questionnaires and medical examinations at ages 4, 8 and 12 years. In the Netherlands the prevalence of obesity is relatively low compared with that in the UK and USA. However, we observed higher blood pressure levels, more adverse cholesterol concentrations and more asthma symptoms in overweight than in normal weight children. Furthermore, in the 12-year-old children we observed similar blood pressure and cholesterol levels in normal weight children with and without a history of overweight. This suggests that the effects of overweight on blood pressure and cholesterol might be reversible, which is promising. In the studies with cardiovascular and respiratory outcomes, we assessed the relative importance of waist circumference and BMI in these associations. We have not demonstrated that children’s waist circumference is always more important than BMI in associations with health outcomes. However, we have several findings indicating that waist circumference is at least as strongly associated with adverse health outcomes as BMI is. Furthermore, we found the early-life determinants maternal pre-pregnancy overweight, maternal smoking during pregnancy and rapid infant weight gain to be associated with 8-year-olds’ cholesterol concentrations. BMI was associated with current asthma symptoms, but a high BMI and large waist circumference were not associated with lower lung function, measured as FEV1\\xad and FVC, in 8-year-old children. Over the 4-8 age range, we prospectively studied the association between BMI and asthma symptoms to assess whether this association could be explained by pro-inflammatory proteins such as hs-CRP, C3 and C4. We found a strong cross-sectional association between BMI and asthma symptoms. We did not find evidence for a role of the measured pro-inflammatory proteins in the association between BMI and asthma symptoms. Furthermore, waist circumference measured and reported by the parents corresponded well with the waist circumference measured by the professionals, indicating that reported waist circumference may be used to study associations between waist circumference and risk factors or health outcomes. The most important conclusions of this thesis were, firstly, that already in childhood being overweight has adverse consequences; overweight children had higher blood pressure levels, more adverse cholesterol concentrations and more asthma symptoms than normal weight children. Secondly, waist circumference measured and reported by parents corresponded well with waist circumference measured by professionals.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Anticancer drugs are valuable assets in the treatment of cancer. However, before a new drug is admitted to the market and available for patients, it has to survive a lengthy path of pre-clinical and clinical studies to demonstrate its efficacy and safety. Critical information required to understand the clinical behaviour of a drug is its disposition: the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion. This thesis focuses on the ultimate clinical study in which these drug characteristics can be determined: the mass balance study. In a typical mass balance study in oncology, a drug is mixed with a radiolabelled isotope and administered to a small group of patients. After administration, blood samples and excreta are collected and analysed for total radioactivity (unchanged drug plus metabolites), for unchanged drug and for unknown metabolites. The gathered data is used to determine the pharmacokinetic parameters of the drug and to identify the metabolites and major biotransfomation pathways. \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter an introductory review outlining the bioanalytical aspects of mass balance studies, this thesis describes the results of these studies for the anticancer agents bendamustine, eribulin, lenvatinib and dovitinib. To support the mass balance studies, quantitative analysis methods needed to be developed for the agents bendamustine, eribulin and lenvatinib. Using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), assays were established and validated to quantify bendamustine and three metabolites in plasma and urine, eribulin in plasma, urine, whole blood and faeces, lenvatinib in whole blood and lenvatinib and four metabolites in plasma, urine, and faeces. \\r\\n\\r\\nFour to six patients with advanced cancer were enrolled in the mass balance studies and these patients received a single 14C-radiolabelled dose of the agent under investigation, which was followed by collection of excreta and blood samples. In a subsequent study phase, patients could continue receiving treatment with non-labelled drug in their best interest, whereby safety and efficacy was monitored. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe alkylating agent bendamustine was extensively metabolised and rapidly cleared from plasma. Approximately half of the radioactive dose was recovered in urine and a quarter in faeces. Metabolite profiling of urine with high-resolution mass spectrometry revealed 25 bendamustine-related compounds, including products of N-demethylation, hydroxylation, hydrolysis, N-dealkylation, oxidation, cysteine conjugation and various other conjugations. The range of metabolic reactions was similar as previously demonstrated in rats. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe antimitotic drug eribulin was slowly eliminated and primarily excreted unchanged in faeces. Only minor metabolites were detected in plasma, urine and faeces. The oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor lenvatinib was rapidly absorbed and extensively metabolised, with subsequent excretion predominantly in faeces. Dovitinib, also an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was well absorbed, extensively distributed and mainly eliminated by oxidative metabolism followed by excretion, predominantly in faeces. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion, quantitative bioanalytical methods were developed and successfully applied in mass balance studies, to extensively investigate their pharmacokinetics. This thesis demonstrates the value of mass balance studies and provides a better understanding of the disposition of four anticancer drugs, thereby contributing to the development of these drugs.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['This thesis describes studies on the electric potential of a neuronal population of about half a million neurons. It is essential to understand neurophysiology at the millimeter scale since ECoG and fMRI studies have shown that some functional units are specifically defined at this scale. While ECoG measures neuronal activity, fMRI only reflects its vascular and metabolic correlate and it is not well understood how this relates to the underlying neurophysiology. In the setting of motor and language function we used ECoG to define the dominant neurophysiological processes at the scale of millimeters: high frequency changes that are related to local neuronal activity and low frequency changes that reflect more global processes. We studied their interaction and investigated how these are related to the fMRI BOLD change to gain a better understanding of the role of these processes. The studies described in this thesis were done in a clinical setting with a brain computer interface (BCI) application in mind. These studies are relevant for at least two questions from the BCI field. First, which part of the ECoG signal is optimal for BCI and whether the optimal location for a BCI device can be predicted with fMRI. This thesis has shown several characteristics of the fMRI and ECoG signal that can help to answer these questions. First, chapter 4 showed that in the subjects who were scanned on a 1.5 T scanner instead of on a 3 T scanner, the signal in primary sensorimotor cortex did not correlate as well with high frequencies. It is thus necessary to have a good signal to noise ratio to be able to use fMRI as a localizer for high frequencies. Second, chapter 4 shows that large fMRI signal changes in primary sensorimotor areas corresponded best with high frequency increases, similar as what we have shown in chapter 3 for premotor cortex during motor imagery and for dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during working memory 58. However, in nonprimary areas, there may be BOLD changes that do not correspond to high frequency power change, but only to low frequency power changes. It is thus essential to choose areas with a primary involvement in a task, with a large BOLD signal change, before implantation of an electrode is considered. Furthermore, it is often assumed for brain computer interfaces that every action is linked to the same neuronal activity. Chapter 5 shows a drastic decrease in high frequency activity during fast repeated movement. It may be much more difficult to classify these faster movements compared to slower movement. In short, using fMRI to localize target areas for BCI seems possible when people are scanned on a 3T machine or at even higher field strength, provided that a) an electrode is placed on an area primarily involved in the task at hand, b) high frequency power changes are used to control a BCI and c) repetition effects are well understood before an electrode is placed.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Therapeutic proteins have become invaluable in treating a wide range of serious and life-threatening diseases. However, repeated administration of these drugs to patients often induces the formation of undesirable anti-drug antibodies, also known as immunogenicity. Among the factors that are known to play a role in immunogenicity of therapeutic proteins, the presence of protein aggregates has been indicated as one of the main product-related risk factors. Even though several studies have shown that protein aggregates have the propensity to trigger an antibody response against the monomeric form of the protein, little is known about the particularities that make them immunogenic. The work presented in this thesis focuses mainly on aggregate characterization and aggregate-related immunogenicity of monoclonal antibody formulations, using a monoclonal human IgG1 with k light chains as a model. The use of emerging analytical techniques for the characterization of IgG aggregates is evaluated; non-native aggregation mechanisms of IgG are studied; the fate of fluorescently labeled IgG aggregates upon contact with human biological fluids in vitro and upon injection in mice is investigated; and the correlation between type and amount of IgG aggregates with their immunogenic potential is studied in transgenic mice (containing the human genes for Ig heavy and light chains) and their nontransgenic counterparts'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a rare and devastating lung disease of unknown aetiology. Itis thought to be caused by repetitive damage to the epithelium and abnormal repair. The resulting fibrosis is defined by an overgrowth of fibroblasts and extracellular matrix deposition which results in fatal respiratory dysfunction. IPF mainly occurs in elderly white males and has an average survival time of less than 4 years. \\r\\n\\r\\nCurrently, there is no simple test available to diagnose IPF. Clinical findings such as lung function tests and high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) are often considered sufficient, especially in typical cases of IPF. In other cases, lung biopsy will be needed. In many cases a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) will be performed to help exclude other diagnoses.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe aim of this thesis was to find disease specific markers. In the search for molecular markers for diagnosis and prognosis, we focused especially on the immunological response to injury and on apoptosis, because of their emerging role in the pathogenesis of IPF. We hypothesized that the results might also contribute to new insights into the biological mechanisms involved in IPF. \\r\\n\\r\\nGenetic variations in TP53 and CDKN1A, the genes encoding p53 and p21, were associated with susceptibility to IPF and progression of the disease, in our cohort of 77 IPF patients. P53 and p21 are vital cell cycle regulators that influence apoptosis, cellular senescence and proliferation. Variations in these proteins could affect the damage and repair processes in the alveolar epithelium.\\r\\n\\r\\nDamaged epithelium is thought to send out signals that activated the immune system. Many inflammatory cytokines are elevated in IPF patients but their exact role in the disease is unknown. We measured levels of MRP14 and YKL-40 in serum and BAL fluid of IPF patients and in closely related interstitial lung diseases. These proteins are thought to be produced by macrophages, neutrophils and epithelial cells and may represent chronic inflammation and fibrosis. Both MRP14 and YKL-40 were elevated in IPF patients and were highest in diseases that are hallmarked by fibrosis. YKL-40 was significantly associated with the prognosis in IPF patients\\r\\n\\r\\nWe also performed a meta-analysis of genetic variations in IL1RN that were determined in 5 IPF cohorts with a total of 302 IPF patients and 879 healthy controls. The VNTR*2 haploblock was significantly associated with IPF susceptibility and resulted in lower levels of the cytokine IL-1Ra. Our results suggest IL-1Ra plays a role in IPF pathogenesis. IL-1Ra is an inhibitor of the pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokine IL-1. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe findings in this thesis confirm that apoptosis and immune responses play a role in IPF susceptibility and progression. Our results suggest there may be a role for alternatively activated macrophages in the aetiology of IPF. These macrophages, also referred to as M2 macrophages, play a role in wound repair and fibrosis. They are thought to be elevated in IPF patients and may be associated with a poor prognosis. Further research is needed to identify the exact nature of the M2 macrophages and their role in IPF'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Fibrosis represents the common final pathway of many chronic diseases including inflammatory, ischemic and metabolic disorders. There is great need for non-invasive biomarkers that reflect activity of the fibrogenic process and can help predict progression. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) seems an ideal biomarker for monitoring ongoing fibrosis, since it is an important fibrogenic cytokine that is readily quantifiable in body fluids. Plasma and urine CTGF levels are increased in various chronic diseases. However, there is lack of knowledge of the processes contributing to elevated CTGF levels, which hampers correct interpretation. Thus far, CTGF levels were expected to reflect CTGF tissue expression. Aim of this thesis was to determine whether elimination and distribution processes may also influence CTGF levels. To investigate this, the pharmacokinetic profiles of CTGF and its N-terminal fragment (N-CTGF), the predominant form of CTGF in plasma and urine, were studied. Rodent and human studies showed that plasma N-CTGF is highly dependent on glomerular filtration rate (GFR). In healthy rodents, intravenously administered N-CTGF was primarily eliminated by the kidney. Plasma N-CTGF accumulated in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients with the highest levels in end stage kidney disease. Successful kidney transplantation resulted in a decrease of plasma CTGF proportional to the increase of GFR. In contrast, full length CTGF was primarily eliminated by the liver in healthy rodents, presumably via a low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein1-mediated pathway. Full length CTGF had a large distribution volume due to a protamine-sensitive process, presumably extensive binding to heparan sulphate proteoglycans. Rodent and human studies demonstrated that urinary CTGF is highly dependent on tubular function. In healthy subjects hardly any CTGF was excreted into the urine, due to almost complete proximal tubular reabsorption of filtered CTGF via megalin-mediated endocytosis. Impairment of tubular protein reabsorption, either by Gelofusine or in megalin-deficient mice, resulted in substantially increased urinary CTGF excretion. Urinary CTGF was tightly associated with β2-microglobulin in CKD patients, indicating that elevated urinary CTGF may reflect proximal tubular dysfunction. In diabetes mellitus, a disorder characterized by high renal CTGF expression, urinary CTGF was determined by both decreased tubular reabsorption of filtered CTGF and increased CTGF expression in glomeruli and medullary tubules. Plasma CTGF was further explored in two large patient populations. In hemodialysis patients, plasma CTGF was associated with residual kidney function and presence of cardiovascular disease. Elevated plasma CTGF increased the risk of all-cause mortality. Plasma CTGF was not removed by low flux hemodialysis and its concentration increased over time while hemodiafiltration substantially lowered plasma CTGF resulting in a sustained decrease. In patients with manifest vascular disease, plasma CTGF was related to GFR and total cholesterol and showed a robust association with the risk of new cardiovascular events and mortality. In conclusion, this thesis shows that impaired elimination and altered distribution may influence CTGF levels in chronic disorders, in addition to increased CTGF production. This knowledge is essential for correct interpretation of CTGF levels. Furthermore, CTGF may be regarded as risk marker for mortality in hemodialysis patients and patients with vascular disease'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The main topic of this thesis is arteriogenesis and the role circulating leukocytes play in this process of perfusion recovery. We have used clinically applicable inhibitors to increase leukocyte attraction and extravasation and discovered previously unknown factors which play a role in arteriogenesis. In chapter 2 we sought to further elucidate the systemic changes that occur in circulating leukocytes after arterial occlusion. We have shown that the total number of leukocytes did not change after arterial occlusion. However, leukocyte number within the different subsets changed dramatically and the emerging temporal patterns differed per leukocyte subset. In addition, the observed changes could be linked to the corresponding progenitor cells in the bone marrow. In chapter 3 we used the clinically available CD26 inhibitor Sitaglipin to improve perfusion recovery in atherosclerosis prone ApoE -/- mice. Daily doses of the CD26 inhibitor improved both short term (7 days) and long term (56 days) perfusion recovery. As previous pro-arteriogenic factors also proved to increase atherosclerosis we assessed plaque stability in ApoE -/- mice during CD26 inhibition. Plaque stability and plaque size were unaffected by CD26 inhibition indicating that CD26 inhibition might be a feasible therapeutic strategy to improve perfusion recovery in the clinic. In addition, recent results have shown that CD26 inhibition deters the progression of atherosclerosis in murine models[1,2]. To improve our understanding of the role that CD26 plays in human plaques we assessed CD26 content in chapter 4. We show that a higher CD26 content is correlated to a more atheromatous plaque in contrast to a more fibrous plaque. In addition, a higher CD26 content is related to a high number of macrophages, a larger lipid core and less smooth muscle cells. Our data indicates that CD26 is involved in the progression towards a more vulnerable plaque phenotype. However, based on our studies we cannot draw any conclusions on the mechanisms involved. In chapter 5 we explored the role of platelets in perfusion recovery. Platelet depleted mice were generated using a platelet depleting antibody. Platelet depleted mice show decreased perfusion recovery as well as reduced arterial remodeling. Macrophage numbers around growing collaterals were decreased and ex vivo models showed that leukocyte rolling was absent in blood from platelet depleted mice. Our results indicate that platelets are involved in the process of monocyte extravasation which is crucial for perfusion recovery. In chapter 6 we assessed differences in mRNA expression between leukocyte samples obtained at different time points after perfusion recovery. We assessed mRNA expression of CXCL10 which is a component of the TLR-pathway and found that its expression was down regulated. Using CXCL10 -/- mice we showed that mice lacking CXCL10 display a decrease in perfusion recovery when compared to WT mice. To elucidate the role of CXCL10 specifically in bone marrow derived cells we generated chimeric mice which lack CXCL10 in their bone marrow derived cells. These mice showed a similar decrease in perfusion recovery indicating that the expression of CXCL10 in leukocytes is of importance during perfusion recovery.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) is characterized by amenorrhea in association with postmenopausal follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels in women younger than 40 years. POI affects 1% of women and greatly influences a woman’s fertility potential and her overall health. The exact cause of POI remains to be elucidated in most women. In 2004, the Dutch POI consortium was established. This national collaboration is aimed at unraveling the genetic components of POI and to further describe the phenotype of women affected by POI. This thesis presents results from the ongoing research activities of the national POI collaboration. POI is nowadays regarded as a complex genetic trait. Through the common disease - common variant approach, research is focused on the identification of important new genes and non-coding alleles involved in gene expression modulation. It is of utmost importance to include a homogeneous and well-phenotyped population in this type of study. We demonstrated that women with familial POI (incidence of 29%) have no distinctive phenotype characteristics than women with sporadic POI, and conclude that familial background of POI does not necessitate a different genetic approach. Meanwhile, researches worldwide have always focused on the possibility that specific single gene mutations could explain a considerable proportion of POI, especially in familial cases. One of these candidate genes is NR5A1. In contrast to previous findings of a mutation frequency of 8% of NR5A1 in women with POI, we found an overall mutation rate of only 1.4%. NR5A1 can therefore not be considered as a major contributor to the presence of POI. Similarly, FMR1 premutations and intermediate-sized CGG repeat alleles were previously found to contribute to POI in up to 13%. In our POI cohort only 1.7% of women were FMR1 premutation carriers. Moreover, measures of POI severity did not significantly depend on CGG repeat numbers, which emphasizes that normal and intermediate FMR1 CGG repeat sizes do not play a central role in POI. While hypoestrogenemia in women with POI and the probably associated effects have been fairly well documented, the role of androgens remains to be determined. Our systematic review and meta-analysis showed that women with POI have significantly decreased total testosterone concentrations in comparison with female controls. A complicating factor in this matter is that androgen measurement in female samples is problematic due to trueness and precision problems. We assessed that, compared with a labor-intensive extraction radioimmunoassay, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry is a reliable, fast alternative for measuring androgen hormones in women. Women about to undergo gonadotoxic treatment are increasingly seeking medical help for fertility preservation. Fifteen children have now been born following ovarian cryopreservation and subsequent autotransplantation. The question remains whether this still experimental technique is sufficiently successful (possible publication bias) to offer to women about to undergo gonadotoxic treatment. We identified that ovarian reserve parameters such as AMH and inhibin B, are very low following this procedure, which indicates a low ovarian reserve status. This explains the poor pregnancy rate, and we therefore conclude that this method is not very successful.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Infection with low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) virus is widespread and has led to outbreaks in domestic birds in many countries. Although infection does not pose a serious concern for animal heath, LPAI virus subtypes H5 and H7 can mutate into the highly pathogenic form (HPAI), which can cause massive epidemics in poultry and threaten human health. However, the knowledge of the underlying mechanisms of mutation from LPAI to HPAI is insufficient for predicting these mutations, especially because the molecular changes necessary for the virulence shift seem to occur at random. Hence, to reduce the likelihood of HPAI emergence, LPAI circulation in general should be reduced. To this end, early detection of LPAI infections in domestic poultry is fundamental. The main objective of this thesis was to develop a framework of surveillance strategies for the early detection of LPAI infections in poultry. The studies described in this thesis were based on surveillance data collected during the LPAI epidemics in Italy in the period 2000-2009, which involved both the industrial and rural sectors. First of all, the Italian monitoring system, which is the longest running system in the EU, was evaluated in terms of its capacity to detect outbreaks of LPAI infection in poultry, with particular regard to fattening turkeys, which has been the most affected species. It was shown that the majority of outbreaks were detected by active surveillance, which was especially successful in vaccinated flocks, given the vaccine-induced decrease in the severity of clinical signs and the consequent reduction in the sensitivity of passive surveillance. Subsequently, the involvement of the rural poultry sector in LPAI outbreaks was investigated. Grower and dealer holdings probably play a major role in perpetuating the infection, due to the peculiar husbandry and trade practices adopted, which facilitate the circulation and persistence of LPAI viruses in the rural sector. After that, the transmission dynamics of LPAI infections in industrial turkey flocks was modelled based on field data, and it was shown that these dynamics varied greatly among flocks. Subsequently, the sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic assays for detecting LPAI antibodies were estimated, without considering any assay as a gold standard. The estimates confirmed that the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test, which is generally accepted as the gold standard, has a near perfect accuracy and may be considered as a reference test; however, to perform LPAI surveillance, for which large numbers of samples have to be processed, valid alternatives exist. Finally, different surveillance strategies were evaluated in terms of their performance for early warning; it was shown that the prompt detection of LPAI outbreaks in turkeys can be achieved through active surveillance by increasing the sampling frequency to once every 15 days, though very frequent sampling may not be sustainable in the long term. In the last chapter, the main findings of the above mentioned studies were integrated and critically discussed coming up with a framework of surveillance strategies for the early detection of LPAI infections in industrial poultry.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Chronic kidney disease is an important cause of morbidity and mortality, and its prevalence is increasing. The histopathological hallmark of chronic kidney disease is renal fibrosis, a process of extracellular matrix formation and atrophy of functional renal tissue resulting from sustained injury. The pathophysiology of this process is complex, with many mediators and mechanisms involved in remodeling of extracellular matrix. In this thesis, we focus on the role of the antifibrotic bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs, particularly BMP-6) and the profibrotic connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) in renal fibrogenesis, via experimental and human studies. Data are presented on the interplay between BMP-expression levels, oxidative stress and inflammation in a mouse model of obstructive nephropathy. The impact of BMP-6 knockdown on renal fibrosis was studied by implementing unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) in BMP-6 null and wild-type mice. There was increased inflammation in obstructed kidneys of BMP-6 null compared to wild-type animals, with upregulation of genes and proteins involved in matrix formation. There was also increased tubulointerstitial damage and an altered, profibrotic growth factor profile. Exploring the mechanisms by which BMP-6 deficiency exerts its harmful effects, we noticed increased levels of circulating myofibroblast progenitor cells and increased renal iron deposition with increased oxidative stress responsive gene expression. To study the effects of genetic CTGF attenuation on fibrosis in the context of chronic and severe renal injury, transgenic CTGF+/- and wild-type CTGF+/+ mice were subjected to models of long-term diabetes (6 months), UUO and aristolochic acid nephropathy. All three models resulted in a severe renal phenotype with generation of tubulointerstitial damage. In the diabetes model, also significant increases in albuminuria, mesangial matrix volume and glomerular basement membrane thickness were present. However, the experiments failed to show differences in renal phenotype between CTGF+/- and wild-type mice. This possibly relates to the context of pronounced kidney damage in this study, or the relatively mild effect of genetic CTGF lowering. It is conceivable that reducing CTGF expression to subnormal levels is needed to prevent harmful effects in severe renal damage. The SNP -945GC in the promoter of the human CTGF gene was investigated with respect to plasma levels of CTGF and to outcome in a large population of diabetes type 1 patients with or without nephropathy. It was confirmed that plasma CTGF levels were higher in patients with diabetic nephropathy as compared to normoalbuminuric diabetic patients, but there was no relationship between genotype and nephropathy, renal and cardiovascular outcome, or mortality. Furthermore, urinary CTGF (uCTGF) levels were evaluated in kidney transplant patients. At 3 and 12 months after transplantation, there was a correlation between the low molecular weight proteins α1 and β2-microglobulin and uCTGF, reflecting tubular dysfunction. However, there was no predictive effect of uCTGF on long-term renal function. The data from this study underscore the complexity of interpreting biomarkers for renal fibrosis, especially in complicated settings such as kidney transplantation.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is one of the most common types of partial epilepsy. Because about 30% of the TLE patients poorly respond to medication, identification of new drug targets to treat TLE is imperative. This requires detailed knowledge of the pathophysiology of TLE . The aim of this thesis was to provide such new information through profiling of surgically removed brain tissue and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of TLE patients. The complex changes in the TLE brain indicate simultaneous dis-regulation of multiple pathways, possibly by microRNAs (miRNAs). These are newly discovered molecular switches which can control expression of multiple proteins by regulating translation of transcribed mRNA into protein. Expression profiling all human miRNAs in the human TLE brain (Chapter 2) revealed distinct miRNA expression profiles TLE patients with and without hippocampal sclerosis. In TLE patients we found an over representation of miRNAs regulation proteins in the immune system. Two of these miRNAs (221 and 222) regulated glial expression of ICAM1, a protein important in the blood-brain barrier, which is impaired in TLE tissue. Thus, microRNAs may act as molecular switches in TLE, particularly in regulation of the inflammatory response (activated immune system). In Chapter 3 we therefore profiled the activated immune system in TLE. Using a high-throughput ELISA system we simultaneously measured 40 inflammatory proteins in brain tissue of TLE patients. This study replicated the up-regulation of a number of inflammatory mediators previously implicated in TLE studies, and also identified new inflammatory proteins up-regulated in the TLE brain. Principle component analysis showed that individual patients segregate into groups based on their unique expression profile. Moreover, up-regulation of the immune system in TLE occurs in clusters or networks. Interestingly, these up-regulated networks of immunological mediators contained both potentially pro- and anti-epileptogenic proteins. These results provide an explanation for the limited success of general anti-inflammatory treatment in TLE and suggest that treatment strategies should be directed to immune therapy interfering with specific pro-epileptogenic pathways. In chapter 4 we showed that part of the immune profiles identified in brain tissue of TLE patients could also be detected in CSF of these patients. These data indicate that immune profiling of CSF may have diagnostic potential for TLE. In chapter 5 we studied whether expression changes of a subset of up-regulated inflammatory mediators (chemokines), maybe causally involved in TLE. We analysed expression of chemokines at different times after the induction of epileptogenesis in an animal model for TLE. Our results showed that some chemokines are up-regulated early in epileptogenesis, way before the clinical symptoms of TLE occur (spontaneous recurrent seizures). Thus our data suggest a causal role of these chemokines in epileptogenesis. In all, this thesis constructs a detailed picture of the posttranscriptional TLE brain and indicate that profiles of miRNA and inflammatory mediators may contribute to the diagnosis of TLE and provide leads to devise new treatment strategies'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Robustness and Optimal Design Issues for Cluster Randomized Trials'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Cluster randomized trials (CRT), in which whole clusters instead of individuals are assigned to conditions, are not uncommon in the social, behavioral, educational, medical and organizational sciences. Though the assignment of individuals to treatment conditions is more efficient, this may not always be feasible due to ethical, financial or organizational reasons. Using a CRT has consequences with respect to the sample size and data analysis technique. The sample size should be increased to reach the same level of efficiency as with subject-level randomization and the data should be analyzed with a technique like multilevel analysis that accounts for the dependency of subjects within the same cluster. The intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) is a measure for this dependency, but may also be seen as the proportion cluster level variance of the total variance. Thanks to extensive literature, most researchers are aware of the forenamed consequences of application of a CRT and take them into account when designing a CRT and analyzing the resulting data. However, various issues concerning design and robustness remained unclear so far and some of these issues have been covered by this thesis. In the design phase of a CRT the researcher has to determine the optimal allocation of units at the cluster and at the subject level for detecting the treatment effect -if existing- with the highest precision. The optimal allocation depends, among other things, on the magnitude of the ICC. In advance this value is unknown and the researcher has to make an educated guess. It is shown that the design is rather robust against incorrect ‘initial’ ICC estimates. The performance of multilevel structural equation modeling applied to a 2\\uf0e01\\uf0e01\\uf0e01 mediation model is investigated. It is shown that the mediation effect itself is estimated seemingly accurately. However, the parameters that determine the mediation effect are often biased, even with large sample sizes. Three different incorrect model specifications are investigated; heteroscedasticity, ignoring partially nesting, and ignoring inequality of within-cluster and contextual effects. In a CRT the variance in the experimental condition may differ from the variance in the control condition. This phenomenon is called heteroscedasticity and may be due to the treatment. When in a CRT one of the conditions consists of clusters, while the other condition consists of non-clustered individuals, the resulting data has a partially nested structure. In case a subject level covariate is taken into account, the multilevel model gives a single estimate for its effect, since the model assumes that there is no between-cluster effect. In practice the within-cluster and contextual effect may differ and when not modeled this difference is ignored. It is shown that within the framework of a CRT it is advisable to model the design specific issues appropriately when the researcher wishes to have a complete and correct view of the various effects and relations between the variables in the model. However, it is also shown that the estimation of the treatment effect and its standard error is rather robust.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Robert Musil wrote Der Mann ohne Eigenschaften as a critical intervention in the intellectual debates of his time. There are three general questions which prevail in the Musil scholarship: 1. What exactly did he want to critique and how is this critique at work in the novel? 2. What were his aims with his critique or the utopian aspect of his work? 3. What is the function of all the pathological behavior in Der Mann ohne Eigenschaften? I attempt to clarify these three general concerns in this dissertation. Moreover, instead of seeing them as three distinct topics, I argue that all three are inseparable from each other and can only be understood in relation to each other. In the first chapter I look at Musil’s work as a critical project. In Musil’s analysis of the mechanisms that were hampering people from facing the present and to form new epistemological and ethical models adequate for modern life, morality and ideology play a crucial role. In his view, people were profoundly shaped by the prevailing moral order, a bond which was strengthened, perpetuated and motivated by ideological apparatuses. Throughout Der Mann ohne Eigenschaften, Musil relentlessly exposes and problematizes the mechanisms that kept people in a state of rigidity, blocking them from transforming their ethical and conceptual guidelines according to the challenges and possibilities of the modern world. In the second chapter, I look at Musil’s work as a utopian project. If the first chapter presents what was hampering the capacity to form a new ethics, the second chapter explores how Musil was trying to overcome this state and what he was hoping to achieve. His utopianism does aim for one stable ideal state, but is inherently open-ended, aiming toward the constant reformation and readjustment of one’s approach and norms. In the third chapter I explore the different ways in which the pathological plays a role in Der Mann ohne Eigenschaften. Rather than one homogenous theme, I argue that the role of the pathological, madness and the monstrous in Der Mann ohne Eigenschaften, works on different levels at the same time. From diverse writings, I distill a Musilian theory of pathology, which should be distinguished from the ways other artists adopted the theme of madness or pathology to critique society. At the same time, Musil never stops critiquing the rhetoric of pathology adopted by conservative, moralist groups. He exposes the rhetoric of those defending the old moral order and a naturalized view on humans, society and its values in clinical terms, as if everything which poses a threat to this order is a deviation of a “healthy”, “natural” order. And finally, I situate the prevalence of pathological, transgressive behavior in Der Mann ohne Eigenschaften as a technique to expose the inadequacy of the current moral models or norms and to increase the need and possibility for new ethical formations. Finally, in a postscript, I look at the relevance of Musil’s ideas for today, in the light of the recent stage adaptation by Toneelhuis.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Several obesity-related metabolic abnormalities may contribute to the unfavorable cardiovascular risk in obese subjects. These risk factor include dyslipidemia, reflected by low HDL-cholesterol and high triglycerides, hypertension, low-grade inflammation, a prothrombotic state and abnormalities in glucose homeostasis. Dysfunctional adipose tissue, characterized by an increased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, free fatty acids and a decreased secretion of anti-inflammatory adipokines, has been implicated in the development of cardiovascular risk factors. A review of literature presented in this thesis shows that dysfunctional adipose tissue may influence platelet activity, enhance the production of coagulation proteins and attenuate fibrinolysis, thus stimulating a prothrombotic state. The concept of the adipose tissue–liver axis is proposed indicating an interconnection between adipose tissue and the liver through the portal vein, in which visceral adipose tissue(VAT) derived adipokines and cytokines are secreted that may induce the hepatic synthesis of coagulation proteins and pro-inflammatory cytokines. In subsequent in vitro experiments, it was shown that the secretome of (pre)adipocytes stimulated the production of fibrinogen and plasminogen activator inhibitor(PAI)-1 by HepG2 hepatocytes, while there was no effect on tissue factor production. Predominantly interleukin(IL)-6 and IL-1β present in the culture media from (pre)adipocytes were responsible for stimulating fibrinogen and PAI-1 production respectively. To determine the association between the amount and composition of adipose tissue and markers of hemostasis, coagulation and fibrinolysis, a study in 32 patients undergoing aortic surgery was undertaken. Plasma concentrations of thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor, tissue plasminogen activator, factor VIII and PAI-1 were significantly higher in the inferior mesenteric vein compared with the subclavian vein, suggesting that VAT may contribute to circulating levels of these proteins. Furthermore, not only the amount of subcutaneous adipose tissue(SAT) and VAT was related to prothrombotic proteins, also morphologic characteristics of adipose tissue were associated with these proteins. Also, a broad panel of cytokines, chemokines and adipokines was measured in mesenteric and systemic venous blood samples of this study population. Higher levels of the chemokine interferon-g-inducible protein(IP)-10 and angiogenic hepatic growth factor(HGF) in the inferior mesenteric vein led to the hypothesis that VAT significantly contributes to these proteins. Amount and morphology of adipose tissue were predominantly related to adiponectin levels. The hypothesis that VAT contributes to IP-10 and HGF levels was supported by the significant relation between specifically VAT and these proteins in a large cohort of patients with manifest vascular disease from the SMART-study. In addition, both IP-10 and HGF were independently associated with components of the metabolic syndrome. Even though patients with atherosclerotic disease usually already exhibit a state of low-grade inflammation, still C-reactive protein(CRP) levels were significantly higher with increasing adiposity in these patients. Specifically VAT and not SAT was associated with (hepatically produced) CRP, supporting the concept that pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by VAT stimulate the production of pro-inflammatory proteins by the liver. In conclusion, evidence presented in this thesis show that VAT, being distinct from SAT with respect to secretory characteristics, may directly influence hepatic metabolism by stimulating coagulation and inflammation.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['To survive and protect: testosterone and the neuroendocrinology of human social behavior'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['The studies reported in this thesis show that despite the development that the human brain has undergone during evolution, this organ and the behavior it brings forth is still strongly sensitive to the effects of testosterone. Testosterone strengthens the neural response to sounds of crying babies, towards faces of anxious and untrustworthy individuals, and during the anticipation of reward. Testosterone further seems to reduce the communication between higher and lower brain structures. These important effects on the brain also manifests itself in behavior. Two studies described in this thesis show that testosterone reduces interpersonal trust and disrupts recognition of emotions of other individuals. An important aspect of these effects of testosterone on behavior is that they are strongly context-dependent and also to a large extent depend on individual differences, for example personality traits, or the amount of testosterone which one is exposed in the uterus. An overview of the literature also presented in this thesis shows that human social behavior is importantly affected by hormones such as testosterone and estradiol, and the neuropeptides oxytocin and vasopressin. As such, testosterone and vasopressin seem especially important in a socially challenging environment that requires action, while oxytocin and estradiol are more important for caring behaviors in a safe environment. The research in this thesis has a fundamental character, but in the long term may contribute to the development of treatment for clinical disorders such as social anxiety disorder.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The number of people conducting exercise in a natural environment, such as walking parts of an ancient pilgrimage, is increasing, justifying scientific research to its health effects. Walking part of the pilgrimage route to Santiago de Compostela in Spain, consisting of 280 km in 12 days, resulted in a sustained weight loss of around 2 kg, but no other beneficial metabolic of vascular effects persisting for at least 2 months after the pilgrimage. However, during the pilgrimage, there was a large, steady decrease in LDL-cholesterol (LDL-c), reaching a maximal decrease on day 10 of 1.1±0.7 mmol/l (-29%) compared to study baseline. Furthermore, male and female participants walking this pilgrimage with higher speed showed a larger increase in HDL-cholesterol (HDL-c), but a smaller decrease in LDL-c and total cholesterol than the participants walking with lower speed, and a higher walking speed was independently related to a higher increase in HDL-c and a lesser decrease in LDL-c. The underlying mechanisms of these changes in serum lipids were not investigated, but consumption of cholesterol for cellular metabolism and repair due to muscle damage seems the most likely explanation. Patients with the metabolic syndrome, participating in a nurse-led lifestyle modification program aiming at increasing physical activity and changing dietary habits, reached a average body weight loss of 2,5% (-2.3 kg. 95%CI -3.8--0.8) after 1 year. Both the amount of baseline physical activity and the change in physical activity during the study, were independently related to beneficial changes in parameters of body weight and insulin resistance. The effects of changes in physical activity on measures of body weight and insulin resistance are small, but increasing physical activity remains a cornerstone in the first step treatment of the metabolic syndrome. In the present thesis we present arguments for obesity and insulin resistance as both causes and consequences of sympathetic nerve activation. We show that typically ultrasonographically measured visceral adipose tissue thickness is independently related to increased resting heart rate in men and, to a smaller extent, in women, even after adjustment for body mass index. Furthermore we show that there is an independent relation between resting heart rate and incident type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) during follow-up in patients with clinically manifest vascular disease. Resting heart rate has been accepted as a risk factor for premature mortality in patients with heart disease, and heart rate reduction is important in the treatment of these patients. In the present thesis we show that an increase in resting heart rate of 10 beats/minute is independently related to an increase in all-cause mortality of 14% (95%CI 7-21%), in vascular mortality of 15% (95%CI 6-25%) and in incident type 2 diabetes of 10% (95%CI 0-21%), in patients with clinically manifest vascular diseases, irrespective of the location. Therefore, we suggest that measurement and evaluation of resting heart rate should become routine practice in the management of patients with clinically manifest vascular diseases and the effect of heart rate reduction therapy in these patients should be investigated.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Complications and therapy after subarachnoid haemorrhage'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) is a subset of stroke with a poor prognosis, up to 40% of patients die. Besides the impact of the initial haemorrhage, several neurological and systemic complications contribute to a poor clinical outcome. The first part of this thesis describes several complications after SAH. It is well known that SAH patients often have hyperglycaemia, and in chapter 2 we showed that patients with hyperglycaemia have a higher risk of poor outcome than patients with lower glucose levels. In chapter 3, we assessed whether intracisternal or intraventricular blood and the severity of hydrocephalus on the initial CT scan were predictors for fever after SAH. Only intraventricular blood was a risk factor for the occurrence of fever. As hydrocephalus might lead to decreased cerebral perfusion, we studied in chapter 4 whether severity of hydrocephalus on the initial CT scan is related to a higher chance of delayed cerebral ischaemia (DCI). However, increasing enlargement of ventricles did not result in a higher chance of DCI. We showed in Chapter 5 that brain natriuretic peptide was elevated after SAH, and that it was related with severe hyponatraemia after SAH but that it could not distinguish hypovolemic from non-hypovolemic hyponatreamia. The second part addresses several grading scales for SAH. In chapter 6 and 7 we showed that the Prognosis of Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Haemorrhage scale (PAASH) has a good prognostic value and interobserver agreement when compared to two commonly used other scales. In chapter 8 we discussed the reliability of the mRankin scale, a commonly used outcome scale, when performed with a telephone interview compared with a face to face interview. We concluded that a telephone assessment with a structured interview can be safely used in clinical research. In the third part we describe several aspects of therapy after SAH. In chapter 9 we described a systematic review on the effects of antiplatelet therapy after SAH. Antiplatelet therapy does not have a beneficial effect on outcome. Likewise, we described in chapter 10 the effects of calcium antagonists, including magnesium. Only nimodipine decreased the occurrence of DCI and poor outcome after SAH, and should be routinely administered in SAH patients. In chapter 11 we showed that DCI is more common after clipping of the patients’ aneurysm than after coiling of the aneurysm. In chapter 12, later timing of aneurysm treatment was related to occurrence of DCI and poor outcome. In chapter 13 we studied the level of serum magnesium and its influence on the effect on DCI and poor outcome, in SAH patients treated with 64 mmol magnesium sulphate per day. A good effect on clinical outcome was seen with a broad range of magnesium levels. Apart from the assumed beneficial effect of magnesium on poor outcome, we showed in chapter 14 that magnesium therapy after SAH diminished headache and use of pain killers. Finally, chapter 15 describes the results of the MASH-II study: a large phase 3 randomised placebo controlled trial on magnesium therapy in SAH patients.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Sentinel lymph node biopsy in breast cancer : procedural issuses and prognostic impact of detecting micrometastases'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['The introduction of the sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in breast cancer patients raised several procedure-related clinical questions as well as questions regarding the implications of the obtained staging information. As a minimally invasive operative procedure as well as an enhanced pathological staging procedure SLNB has become standard of care in breast cancer patients. Part of the SLNB is the injection of a radiofarmacon during lymphoscintigraphy. Different injection techniques translate into different drainage patterns. Ultrasound (US) guided radiofarmacon injection provides a uniform procedure for both palpable and nonpalpable tumors with similar results for lymphoscintigraphic visualization and surgical retrieval rate of axillary and internal mammary sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs). When SLNs contain metastase(s), a supplementary axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is advised. Intraoperative frozen section (FS) analysis of SLNs enables a prompt ALND during the first operation, sparing the patient a second operation. The yield of FS is limited, and discordant FS results (i.e. the absence of SLN metastases in the FS and the presence of metastases following the definitive pathology examination of SLNs) still necessitates a complementary ALND. While discordant FS results were in itself relatively common, the complementary ALND rarely results in postsurgical treatment adjustments. ALND is performed to obtain locoregional control as well as for staging purposesbut comes with significant morbidity. To reduce this ALND-related morbidity, there is a recent interest in the different lymphatic drainage patterns of the breast and arm within the axilla. The different lymphatic patterns may be visualized by doing “ARM”: axillary reverse mapping. ARM is a way of reducing morbidity by selectively removing lymph nodes from the axilla and sparing axillary nodes and lymphatic’s that drain the arm. In a feasibility study we observed the absence of metastases in the ARM lymph nodes in patients who had metastases in their SLNs, while the frequency of ARM-node involvement was 22% in patients who had axillary metastases proven by preoperative US guided cytology. The sensitivity of the SLNB procedure to detect axillary metastases is not 100%. False negative rates are reported in approximately 3% of the patients, implying that the latter proportion of patients will have metastases in the axilla despite a “clean” SLN. Expectedly, patients with a false-negative SLN may develop overt lymph node metastases during follow-up but the extent of the clinical problem is unknown. In a multi-institutional cohort analyses we learned that axillary relapse rates in N0 patients are low. The annual relapse rate was approximately 0.2%. In addition, axillary relapses were significantly more common in patients who underwent ablative surgery, most likely due to the radiotherapy in patients undergoing breast conserving therapy. There is a lively debate regarding the relevance of minimal SLN involvement. In a single and multi-institutional cohort, in terms of overall and disease free survival, we observed no significant differences between N0 and N1mi, while survival in N1 patients was significantly worse. Based on these results we conclude that the presence of lymph node micrometastases should in itself not be a reason to advocate adjuvant systemic treatment'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Transfer of evidence into practice is often slow and therefore remains an important challenge. Factors influencing this process include awareness and agreement with available evidence, feelings about the applicability of the evidence to one’s own patients and pressure from patients to start or refrain from a particular treatment. The best chance of bridging the gap between health research and implementation in daily clinical practice is created by optimizing all steps of the research cycle. In this thesis we used the example of management of children with upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) to study several of the crucial steps in the research cycle. First strategies used to promote the uptake of evidence-based interventions in children with URTI in daily practice were studied. We identified ten studies, and concluded that multifaceted and computer strategies appeared to be most effective to promote the uptake of evidence into practice in the area of URTI in children. Thereafter we studied the balance between costs and effects of pneumococcal conjugate vaccinations (PCV) against AOM in children and found that key assumptions regarding the incidence and costs of AOM episodes have major implications on the estimated cost effectiveness. In an open randomised controlled trial the (cost-) effectiveness of adenoidectomy as compared to watchful waiting in children with recurrent URTI was studied. During the 2 year follow-up we found no relevant differences for the number of URTI. The prevalence of URTI decreased over time in both groups. We concluded that in children selected for adenoidectomy for recurrent URTI, immediate adenoidectomy results in an increase in costs, whereas it confers no clinical benefit over an initial watchful waiting strategy. (Results on cost are not publically available yet.) Subsequently, we performed an Individual Patient Data meta-analysis pooling the original data from 567 children of 3 trials on the effectiveness of adenoidectomy with or without tympanostomy tubes in children with otitis media with effusion (OME). We aimed to identify subgroups of children with OME who will most likely benefit from adenoidectomy and as such facilitate clinical decisions about surgery in OME. (Results are not publically available yet.) We also studied the process from design to publication of clinical research in general in all projects awarded by the Health Care Efficiency Research Program of the Netherlands Organization for Health Research and Development (ZonMw) (i.e., the Dutch “National Institutes of Health”) between 2001 and 2006. We compared the primary outcomes and subgroup analyses reported in the grant application, the trial registry, and their related publications. There was a large discrepancy between grant applications and publications regarding both primary outcomes and subgroup analyses, which is biased favouring statistical significance'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Proteins are essential molecules in all living organisms. Their involvement in numerous biological processes has led to the development of protein-based medicines (biopharmaceuticals). For good understanding of the properties and function of endogenous proteins and biopharmaceuticals, extensive protein characterisation is required. This involves assessment of features such as purity, heterogeneity, stability, activity and conformation of the protein. For instance, an altered protein conformation may influence the protein function and activity, which could have serious health implications. Clearly, there is a demand for suitable analytical methods that allow assessment of protein identity, purity and conformation. Capillary electrophoresis (CE) coupled to fluorescence spectroscopy provides high separation efficiency and selective spectroscopic detection that can be very useful for protein characterisation. Protein modifications, like glycosylation and deamidation, may involve changes in the net charge of a protein and, thus, of its electrophoretic mobility. Moreover, protein conformational changes, like unfolding or aggregation, are often accompanied by a change in protein molecular radius, which is reflected in the electrophoretic mobility as well. Fluorescence spectroscopy can provide information on the conformational state of a protein by monitoring changes in local tryptophan environments. This thesis describes the development and evaluation of novel fluorescence (Flu) and wavelength-resolved fluorescence (wrFlu) detection systems in CE for analysis of intact proteins. In order to accomplish effective Flu detection, a detector set-up was selected that incorporated a lamp as excitation source, a dedicated fluorescence detection cell and a photomultiplier detector. The analytical characteristics of the selected CE-Flu set-up and its suitability for native protein detection were tested using tryptophan and some model proteins. Protein detection limits were 7-33 nM, which was a factor of 25 better than UV absorbance detection at 280 nm, and comparable to UV detection at low-UV wavelengths. In order to obtain conformational information on separated proteins, employment of wavelength-resolved fluorescence detection was required. Therefore, the photomultiplier detector was replaced by a spectrograph equipped with a sensitive charge-coupled device (CCD) as detector. CE-wrFlu of intact proteins allowed acquisition of protein emission spectra ‘on-the-fly’. Detection limits were 6-32 nM, which is comparable to Flu detection. Analysis of model proteins in native (folded) and denatured (unfolded) state showed that protein conformational changes can be monitored via two independent parameters, the position of maximum emission wavelength and the effective electrophoretic mobility. The usefulness of CE-wrFlu for the study of protein unfolding pathways was investigated by measuring non-reduced and reduced β-lactoglobulin B (β-LGB) in several stages of unfolding. Non-reduced β-LGB showed two distinct unfolding pathways, that showed fast and slow interconversion kinetics between folded and unfolded species, respectively. Reduced β-LGB showed only one unfolding pathway, and unfolded at much lower denaturant concentration. These results suggest that disulphide bonds might be a prerequisite for the observed unfolding behaviour of non-reduced β-LGB. The potential applicability of native CE-Flu for the profiling of biopharmaceuticals was evaluated by the analysis of different products of human recombinant erythropoietin. Distinct and repeatable peak profiles were obtained, which allowed discrimination of different products based on the obtained glycoform patterns.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are important pathogens of animals and man. In humans, IAV is the cause of seasonal epidemics and occasional pandemics. The pandemics are caused by suddenly appearing IAVs from animal reservoirs, to which most humans have no immunity. The hemagglutinin (HA) protein plays crucial roles in the early stages of virus infection as it binds to sialic acid receptors, which results in endocytic uptake of the virions, and is responsible for the low pH-induced fusion of viral and cellular membranes. Because of its role in sialic acid receptor binding, it is the most important determinant of virus tropism. In addition, the HA protein is also the major immunogen. Antibody levels against HA correlate with protection against infection and disease. This thesis focuses on these two key features of the HA protein. The HA-receptor interactions were studied by using recombinant soluble stable HA trimers, which are secreted from cells, by replacing the transmembrane anchor of HA with a GCN4 trimerization motif. First we studied to what extent the expression system used, and thus the glycosylation state of the recombinant proteins, interfered with HA-receptor interactions. The results show that this is indeed the case. Differences in receptor specificity between different HA proteins could be demonstrated using recombinant proteins produced in mammalian cells, but not with the HA proteins made in insect cells. This technology was subsequently applied to compare the receptor-binding properties of the HA protein from the swine origin new pandemic H1N1 virus with a closely related H1 protein derived from a swine virus. While the new pandemic H1 protein exhibited hardly any binding to different substrates, the swine protein efficiently bound to a number of sialylated glycans. The two amino acid residues responsible for this difference were identified, which provided new insight into HA-receptor interactions. Also the vaccine potential of the recombinant soluble trimeric HA proteins was evaluated. Immunization of chickens, mice ferrets or swine with the HA trimer preparations was shown to protect against a homologous (lethal) challenge with IAV, including the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1. Vaccination with the trimers induced strong antibody responses and diminished virus replication and excretion upon challenge and decreased clinical effects of infection. In addition, we investigated to what extent the glycosylation state of the HA preparations would affect their immunogenicity. The results consistently demonstrate that HA proteins carrying terminal mannose residues, such as insect-cell produced HA proteins, induce significantly lower antibody titers against HA when compared to fully glycosylated HA preparations. In summary, the research described in this thesis demonstrates the potential of recombinant trimeric soluble HA for the study of HA-receptor interactions and for vaccination purposes.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Malaria has been a plague for human mankind. Each year roughly 125 million pregnancies are at risk for malaria infection. This thesis demonstrates the detrimental effects of malaria in pregnancy on the mother and the baby. To determine the effects of malaria in pregnancy on birth outcomes, accurate pregnancy dating is required and newborn babies weighed precisely. In most malaria endemic areas, antenatal ultrasound, the gold standard for pregnancy dating, does not exist as a result of shortage of machines and qualified sonographers. In the antenatal clinics of the Shoklo Malaria Research Unit on the Thai-Burmese border, local health workers were successfully trained in antenatal ultrasound and midwifes schooled in safe deliveries. In this thesis the promising results of quality assessments are described in fully. Antenatal ultrasound is proposed as a very useful tool for broadening our understanding of adverse fetal growth effects associated with malaria in pregnancy. Reference equations for fetal biometry and birthweight for gestational age were created, which were used for clinical practice and for further analysis of the effect of malaria in pregnancy on fetal growth. Pregnant women and local staff recognized antenatal ultrasound as an acceptable tool and described the benefits they perceived in terms of safety of pregnancy. Malaria in pregnancy was associated with growth restriction across the range of viability in this population. Accurate gestational age assessment, measured by ultrasound, and population centiles, permit differentiation of low birthweight from preterm birth and small for gestational age: low birthweight is a poor predictor of small for gestational age newborns. Despite early treatment in all positive women, one or more (a)symptomatic P.falciparum or P.vivax malaria infections in the first half of pregnancy resulted in a smaller than expected mid-trimester fetal head diameter. In a prospective followed group of pregnant women at risk for malaria with frequent ultrasound, there were no stillbirths and only one case of severe malaria. However, malaria infection in the second trimester was associated with a reduction of fetal head growth, but there was no difference in birthweight centiles between malaria and non-malaria pregnancies. The need for longitudinal analysis of this data, to detect a recovery of growth is highlighted. The new technique of 3D ultrasound volumetry of the placenta was used to improve our understanding of the pathophysiological constraints on fetal growth caused by malaria infection in early pregnancy. Most placental volumes of women who were infected with P.falciparum malaria before the volumes scan were below the 10th centile. There were no gross effects detected in fetal brain development between 22 malaria infected (but immediately treated) and 22 matched, but non infected pregnancies. Close monitoring of pregnant women and prompt treatment of any malaria episode with efficacious drugs minimizes the negative effects of malaria on fetal growth. Governments should encourage the value of antenatal care, early detection and treatment of malaria in pregnancy and correct use of antenatal ultrasound in malaria endemic countries.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Background In HIV-infected patients, tuberculosis (TB) occurs 20 to 30 times more often and is a leading cause of death. Triple combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) reduces mortality and risk of TB in HIV-infected patients. Uganda is a high-burden country of both HIV and TB; more than half of TB patients are also HIV infected. The objectives of this thesis were 1) to evaluate the current state of HIV and TB management and its effects on mortality and TB in an urban HIV care setting in Uganda, and 2) to implement and evaluate ways to optimise care of co-infected patients. Methods Routinely collected data from the HIV clinic at the Infectious Diseases Institute (IDI) in Kampala, Uganda, were used to assess cART provision, mortality and the risk of TB, as well as to investigate the impact of TB on subsequent immune recovery after cART initiation and to evaluate the implementation and impact of an integrated TB-HIV care model and intensified TB case finding. Results The median CD4+ T cell (CD4) counts at cART initiation increased from 82 cells/mm3 in 2005 to 148 cells/mm3 in 2009 at the IDI. At the same time, mortality rates decreased by almost 50% and TB case finding improved. A later year of cART initiation was associated with reduced mortality independent of the higher baseline CD4 count. An unexpected higher risk of TB after initiation of cART containing efavirenz (EFV) compared to nevirapine in patients with CD4 counts'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['The HEART score for chest pain patients'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['The HEART score was developed to improve risk stratification in chest pain patients in the emergency department (ED). This thesis describes series of validation studies of the HEART score and sub studies for individual elements of the score. The predictive value of the HEART score for the occurrence of major cardiovascular events (MACE) in chest pain patients in the ED has been determined in a series of four scientific investigations: two retrospective and two prospective studies, mostly multi center. The HEART score appears a strong predictor of event free survival on one hand and potentially life threatening cardiac events on the other hand. The HEART score helps in making accurate decisions in the ED without the use of X-rays or invasive procedures. Within one hour from presentation, it identifies both (i) a large proportion of low-risk patients, with a risk of MACE of only 1.9%, and (ii) high-risk patients, with a risk of MACE of about 50%. In case of intermediate values, the HEART score is less helpful. The HEART score is an easy, quick, and reliable predictor of outcome in chest pain patients, and may be used for triage. We investigated whether the diagnostic performance of the HEART score could be improved after redesigning based on multivariable regression analysis. We showed that the arbitrarily chosen weights of the five elements of the HEART score leave room for improvement. The improvement is relatively small with more low risk patients categorized in the intermediate risk group. Application of the adjusted HEART score results in a small fraction of diseased patients who may receive urgent treatment earlier. Hence, medical consumption in non-diseased patients will increase. This regression analysis supports the easy-to-use HEART score with an equal distribution of values given for the five elements. We investigated whether the HEART score could be beneficial in reducing this medical consumption. In particular in patients with low HEART scores, hospital admissions and specific diagnostic procedures may be reduced. Avoiding redundant medical care may result in a reduction of iatrogenic damage and cost. Theoretically, annual savings for the national health care system in The Netherlands may exceed ten million Euros. We investigated the additional value of a second troponin measurement or a cycle exercise ECG in chest pain patients in whom the HEART score was determined. A second troponin measurement results in a slight improvement of the HEART-score to discriminate patients with and without MACE, however, the clinical value of the exercise ECG in this setting is still a matter of debate. In summary, the HEART score is easy to calculate and applicable to all chest pain patients within one hour after presentation in the ED. Various approaches to improving the HEART score appear to be disappointing. The studies described in this thesis provide a better view on the approach of chest pain patients in the ED. Our results support the use of the HEART score for early risk stratification of chest pain patients and may result in a reduction of diagnostic procedures and related cost.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Genetic variation in natural populations of Arabidopsis thaliana has allowed the species to adapt to a wide range of environmental conditions. The identification of natural alleles affecting important traits can be used to enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms deployed by Arabidopsis to respond to the environment. These responses are generally controlled by multiple genes contributing quantitatively to the observed phenotypic traits. The molecular dissection of quantitative traits has been aided by the availability of RILs and genetic maps allowing the linkage of traits to genotypes by QTL analysis. The concept of genetical genomics was based on the idea that natural variation not only affects phenotypic traits, but also the variation in gene expression that can be measured on a genome-wide scale. In this thesis it was shown that the quantitative analyses of genome-wide gene expression in the Landsberg erecta (Ler)/Cape Verde Islands (Cvi) RIL population revealed heritable expression patterns for which thousands of eQTLs could be mapped. Local regulation was as prevalent as distant regulation. Loci were detected though, that harbor distant eQTLs for a large number of genes, which possibly point to master regulators. The possibility to dissect gene regulatory networks using eQTL data is based on the assumption that the expression of target genes correlates with the expression of the regulator gene. We successfully applied this principle to construct regulatory networks for genes known to be involved in flowering time and to genes downstream of the master regulator ERECTA. The two genetical genomics experiments described in this thesis allowed an initial comparison which gave an impression of plasticity in gene expression regulation. About 1000, predominantly locally regulated, linkages were identified in both experiments. The majority of eQTLs, however, was specific for each experiment, and enriched for distant eQTLs. We explored the added value of the genetical genomics in the analysis of the response of Arabidopsis to the virulent bacterial strain Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato (Pst) and to treatment with low light in the Ler/Cvi RILs respectively, in search for new factors in the regulation of these stress responses. The higher susceptibility of Cvi compared to Ler could be mapped to several disease susceptibility QTLs in the Ler/Cvi RILs. The major QTL had large impact on the transcriptional response to jasmonic acid during infection. The genetical genomics data allowed the identification of NUDT8, a Nudix hydrolase co-expressed with JA biosynthesis genes. Further studies are needed to analyze the role of NUDT8 in susceptibility of Arabidopsis to Pst infection. The low light treatment is known to induce the shade avoidance syndrome for which Ler and Cvi showed considerable natural variation. A major HTR affected the expression of components of the circadian clock, a ROS-activated signaling cascade and auxin- and sterol homeostasis. A common feature linking these processes could be the regulation of protein ubiquitination. The local regulation of CSN5A by the HTR could indicate a role for the CSN in the HTR-mediated processes. These results demonstrate the added value of genetical genomics in the dissection of quantitative traits.'],\n",

We made longitudinal and transverse ultrasound clips of the carpal tunnel during finger motion and measured the transformation of the median nerve and flexor tendons, as well as the motion direction. Additionally, we measured subsynovial connective tissue thickness and motion. We found that in carpal tunnel syndrome patients, the subsynovial connective tissue is thicker than in healthy controls. To measure its motion, we used a new technique called speckle tracking and found that this method has good accuracy for velocity measurements of SSCT and tendon motion. In the transverse plane, we found that there is more compression of the median nerve in CTS patients than in healthy controls during finger motion. Also, the flexor digitorum superficialis tensons and median nerve have a changed motion pattern compared to healthy persons. These findings can function as baseline data for further research towards understanding the etiology of carpal tunnel syndrome and the role of the subsynovial connective tissue in this disease.

       "  'Description': ['This thesis describes the various aspects of perinatal morbidity and mortality in term infants. Most children are born at a gestational age of more than 36 completed weeks. Their chances of survival are high (99.7%). However, more than a quarter of perinatal deaths occur among births from 37 weeks’ gestation onwards. The perinatal mortality of term infants in the Netherlands in 2008 was 2.7 per 1000 term infants, of which 60% occurred in the antenatal period. To obtain more insight in mortality and severe morbidity of term infants, we started a prospective study in 2007. During a two-year period, all cases of perinatal mortality and morbidity were collected in the in the catchments area of the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) of the University Medical Center Utrecht. The first aim of this study was to improve the quality of obstetric care by organising perinatal audits of all cases of perinatal mortality and severe morbidity of term infants without severe congenital malformation. The second aim was to gain insight into perinatal mortality and severe morbidity in relation to the Dutch obstetric care system. The results of this study are described in this thesis. In part I of this thesis we focused on perinatal morbidity and mortality among term infants in relation to the Dutch obstetrical care system. In total the perinatal death rate was 2.6 per 1000 infants delivered. We found that infants of pregnant women at low risk whose labour started in primary care under supervision of a midwife had a higher risk (RR 2.3, CI 1.1 to 4.8) of delivery related perinatal death compared with infants of pregnant women at high(er) risk whose labour started in secondary care under the supervision of an obstetrician. Inparticular,infantsofwomen whowerereferredfromprimaryto secondarycare duringlabour had morethan3.5-foldhigher (RR 3.7,CI 1.6 to 8.5)perinataldeathratecomparedtoinfantsofwomen whostartedlabourinsecondarycare. With respect to severe morbidity in normal term infants we found no difference between the low risk and high risk pregnancies. However, in the group of low risk women referred during labour from primary care to secondary care, the risk of NICU admission and asphyxia was significant higher compared to high(er)-risk women who started labour in secondary care. These findings are unexpected but seriously questions the supposed effectiveness of the Dutch obstetric system that is based on risk selection and obstetric care at two levels.In part II of this thesis we focused on the results of the perinatal audits. We found a possible or probable relation between substandard care factors and term stillbirths, perinatal asphyxia or perinatal infection in respectively 27%, 58% and 37% of all cases. To improve outcome, knowledge of the cause of perinatal mortality or morbidity is crucial. The underlying cause of death in the ATNICID study, based on the Tulip classification system, in term stillbirths, intrapartum deaths and neonatal deaths was respectively in 72%, 55% and 53% due to placental pathology'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Venous and arterial access are among the most widespread medical procedures performed in children. Especially in young children venous and arterial access can be problematic due to tiny blood vessels that are difficult to localize beneath a layer of baby fat. This thesis describes the development and clinical evaluation of the VascuLuminator, a guidance tool for peripheral venous and arterial access by visualizing blood vessels underneath the skin with near-infrared light. In a third to a fifth of the pediatric patients, more than one attempt is required for a successful intravenous cannulation. Arterial cannulation is successful in one attempt in only 20% of the patients. To facilitate localization of blood vessels, near-infrared light can be used to visualize blood vessels underneath the skin. Based on this knowledge, we developed a device (the VascuLuminator) to facilitate peripheral access to the blood vessels. The VascuLuminator consists of a NIR emitting LED which is placed underneath the puncture site. The light, absorbed by blood and scattered by other tissue, is processed by a NIR-sensitive camera. An LCD display shows an image of the blood vessels as dark lines against a light background of tissue. The VascuLuminator was able to visualize blood vessels in most patients, and was clinically useful in venipunctures. There was a tendency to an increase in success at first attempt in arterial cannulation with the VascuLuminator. However, the VascuLuminator was not clinically beneficial for intravenous cannulation in a general pediatric population. Only in children with a dark skin and anticipated as difficult to cannulate, the VascuLuminator increased success at first attempt. Further research is required to affirm or refute clinical effectiveness of the VascuLuminator in this specific population. The main problem with difficult peripheral venous and arterial access is advancement of the cannula into the vessel, rather than localizing the vessel. Future research should focus on methods to facilitate successful cannula advancement within the vessel'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Prosthetic heart valve (PHV) dysfunction is an infrequent but potentially life-threatening disease with a heterogeneous clinical presentation. Patients with PHV dysfunction clinically can present with symptoms of congestive heart failure (dyspnea, fatigue, edema), fever, angina pectoris, dizziness during exercise or non-specific complaints (e.g. stroke). Non-invasive imaging plays a key role in the establishment of the diagnosis PHV dysfunction. The primary imaging modality for postoperative assessment of PHV function is the transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). TTE is fast, bedside available, patient friendly and relatively cheap compared to more advanced non-invasive imaging techniques. Besides TTE, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and fluoroscopy are available in clinical practice for PHV assessment. These imaging techniques may fail to determine the exact cause of PHV dysfunction. Multidetector-row Computed Tomography (MDCT) is a novel imaging technique to evaluate patients with (suspected) prosthetic heart valve dysfunction. In the in vitro part of this thesis, MDCT imaging is optimized for PHV assessment. Different imaging/acquisition strategies are investigated to develop a low-dose MDCT acquisition protocol for PHV imaging with a good image quality and limited PHV-related artifacts. The application of prospective ECG-triggering and iterative reconstruction are promising for low-dose MDCT imaging of PHVs. Although these low-dose MDCT acquisition protocols have to be validated in patients with PHVs. The in vivo part of this thesis demonstrated that MDCT is a suitable imaging technique to visualize most commonly implanted PHVs except for PHVs that contain a cobalt-chrome alloy in the valve ring. This cobalt-chrome alloy causes severe artifacts which preclude diagnostic assessment of these valves on MDCT images. Besides PHV assessment, coronary artery segments can be assessed in most patients simultaneously. Besides PHV composition, annular movement may influence MDCT image quality of PHVs. End-systolic imaging phases (30-40%) and mid-diastolic imaging phases (75-80%) are the best imaging reconstruction phases for PHV assessment. Other imaging phases (10%-20%-50%-60%) have an inferior image quality and can be preferably imaged with dose modulation or omitted in case of prospectively ECG-triggered acquisition. MDCT is a promising complementary imaging modality to echocardiography and fluoroscopy for the evaluation of patients with (suspected) PHV dysfunction. MDCT has additional diagnostic value especially in patients with suspected aortic PHV obstruction and endocarditis. MDCT may visualize the anatomical substrate that causes the PHV obstruction or endocarditis. Besides additional diagnostic information, MDCT can provide additional information for the surgical planning in patients scheduled for reoperation namely (1) the relation of PHV pathology to relevant surrounding cardiac structures (e.g. coronary arteries), (2) the presence of coronary artery disease in patients with low or intermediate risk of coronary artery disease; and (3) aortic dimensions which can have clinical important implications (e.g. the choice for aortic ascendens replacement). Prospective diagnostic cross-sectional studies are required to determine the additional diagnostic value of MDCT to the clinical routine imaging techniques and its impact on patient management. Non-invasive imaging of prosthetic heart valves is a research field in which new imaging techniques (3D TEE, MDCT and hybrid imaging) can improve diagnostic accuracy in patients with suspected PHV dysfunction in the future'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The aim of this thesis is to assess diagnostic strategies in patients suspected of heart failure (defined as a syndrome in which patients suffer from the inability of the heart to supply sufficient blood flow to meet the needs of the body) in primary care. B-type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP or NT-proBNP, a blood sample measurement) is used as a leverage to assess diagnostic strategies encompassing besides BNP other diagnostic tests as well, with special emphasis on physical examination. Diagnostic research is about using the appropriate patient domain: patients suspected of the disease. And diagnostic research is about multivariable hierarchical tests resulting in an estimated probability of presence of disease. A new diagnostic test should have additional value on top of the other tests usually performed, including history taking and physical examination. In the main study, the Utrecht Heart Failure Organisation – Initial Assessment (UHFO-IA) study, data were collected of 721 patients with suspected heart failure After referral 207 (28.7%) were categorized as having heart failure and 514 as not (yet). A diagnostic rule, based on signs and symptoms, the patient’s medical history and the plasma NT-proBNP test, was derived to help general practitioners decide whether the patient has heart failure. The UHFO rule includes 10 items: age; history of myocardial infarction, CABG or PCI; using a loop diuretic; displaced apex beat; pulmonary rales; irregular pulse; pulse rate; heart murmur; elevated jugular venous pressure and the NT-proBNP level. The rule output is an estimated probability of heart failure present. This study estimated the quantitative diagnostic contribution of elements of the history and physical examination in the diagnosis of heart failure in primary care patients, and may help to improve clinical decision making. The largest additional quantitative diagnostic contribution to those elements was provided by NT-proBNP. The UHFO rule was assessed with respect to cost-effectiveness. Application of UHFO rule based diagnostic strategies are explored over the full course of the patient, starting from being suspected of the disease, being diagnosed timely or later, being treated and experiencing the vicious nature of heart failure, frequently experiencing hospital admissions until an often early death. it is cost effective to apply the UHFO diagnostic rule to arrive at one of three outcomes: 1) heart failure probably not present (probability 80%); start treatment and 3) diagnostic uncertainty remains; refer for cardiology consultation. In the general discussion it is argued that diagnostic studies assessing the value of items from physical examination in suspected heart failure, but also in other suspected diseases, have been too small and often lacked a valid study design. As a consequence, these studies tend to discredit solitary elements of the physical examination. The plea is made to perform large descriptive studies in the relevant patient domain, optimally designed to study the value of diagnostic tests, including findings from physical examination.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The quality of life of patients with chronic rheumatic diseases is negatively influenced by symptoms such as pain, fatigue, and stiffness, and secondary symptoms such as physical limitations and depressive mood. On top of this burden, some patients experience negative responses from others, such as lack of understanding, disbelief, distrust, or being accused of exaggerating the symptoms and consequences of the disease. We call these negative responses of others ‘invalidation’. Invalidation might be due to the invisibility of symptoms for people in the social environment of the patient. Rheumatic diseases that lack objective physical or laboratory features or well-characterized pathologic findings to diagnose the illness, such as fibromyalgia, might especially provoke invalidation. However, little is known about the prevalence and consequences of invalidation as no adequate instrument exists to assess invalidation in patients with rheumatic diseases. Aim of this dissertation was to develop a questionnaire to quantify invalidation in patients with diverse rheumatic diseases and to determine its prevalence, associated variables, and consequences. First, the definition and structure of the concept ‘invalidation’ was studied. Patients described invalidation experiences as active negative social responses (denying, lecturing, and overprotecting) as well as a lack of positive social responses (supporting and acknowledging) with respect to the patient and the condition of the patient. Subsequently, this definition of invalidation was used to develop a questionnaire to measure invalidation, which we called the ‘Illness Invalidation Inventory (3*I)’. The 3*I assess invalidation from five different social environments: spouse, family, medical professionals, work environment, and social services. Patients with rheumatic diseases reported to experience more invalidation by social services, the work environment, and the family than by the spouse and medical professionals. Patients with the rheumatic disease, fibromyalgia, experienced more invalidation than patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Patients who experienced more invalidation had more severe symptoms, a worse mental wellbeing, and they were more often lonely. Emphasizing the perspective of the social environment, rheumatologists experienced little invalidation towards patients in general, but some did experience more invalidation towards patients with fibromyalgia than towards patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Spouses of patients with fibromyalgia and of patients with rheumatoid arthritis estimated the severity of the symptoms of their (patient) spouse fairly similar. This dissertation shows that invalidation can be a problem for patients with rheumatic diseases and especially for patients with fibromyalgia. Invalidation can have a negative effect on the quality of life of patients. It is therefore important to include invalidation in scientific research. Education about invalidation and its effects is important for patients as well as for people in the social environment of the patient. Future studies should focus on the causes and consequences of invalidation to be able to develop effective interventions.'],\n",

       "  'Description': [\"In the first two years after stroke approximately one-third of the patients suffer from depression, also referred to as post-stroke depression (PSD). Patients with PSD suffer from symptoms, such as a diminished interest or pleasure (anhedonia), depressed mood, sleep disturbances, loss of energy, changes in appetite, feelings of inappropriate guilt, concentration difficulties, psychomotor retardation or agitation, and suicidal thoughts. PSD aggravates the burden of physical, psychological and social disability after a stroke and hinders patient participation in rehabilitation. Therefore, the timely recognition and diagnosis of PSD is essential for the optimization of patient recovery from stroke. In this thesis, first, the role of nurses in the daily care of depressed stroke patients is studied in a systematic literature review, focusing on the early detection of PSD and therapeutic interventions that they can use. The findings showed that nurses distinguished a screening role from an intervening role. They recognized symptoms of depression, however, they experienced the assessment of psychological status as difficult because of a lack of knowledge, skills, and training. Measurement scales supporting their observations were seldom used. We also investigated the clinical manifestation of PSD as compared to patients with symptomatic atherosclerotic diseases other than stroke or with patients in general practice. The findings demonstrated broadly similar symptom profiles in the three cohorts, showing that PSD is not a different type of depression. However, the stroke patients suffered more severely from these symptoms than the patients with other symptomatic atherosclerotic diseases or the patients in general practice. Subsequently, the clinimetric properties of the 9-item and the 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9, PHQ-2) were investigated in daily nursing practice of hospitalized patients with stroke able to communicate adequately. The inter-rater reliability, the test re-test reliability and the internal consistency of the PHQ-9 were shown to be good. Nurses judged the PHQ-9 to be a brief and easy-to-use instrument in daily practice of nursing stroke care. The PHQ-9 performed best at a score ≥\\xad10 and the PHQ-2 at a score ≥2. Administering the PHQ-9 only to patients who scored ≥\\xad2 on the PHQ-2 improved the identification of depression. The timely detection of PSD, however, is complicated by a decrease in the length of hospital stay, resulting in a large proportion of patients who are discharged within two weeks after stroke. Therefore, we developed and validated the Post-Stroke Depression Prediction Scale (DePreS).This prediction rule enables clinicians to estimate the degree of the depression risk for an individual patient within the first week after stroke. The prediction could be used as the basis for a more selective screening process for PSD. In conclusion, to decrease the burden of PSD and the negative impact on patients' recovery health care providers, such as nurses, taking care of patients with stroke should use valid and reliable assessment tools in order to detect PSD, which needs to be followed by effective and efficient treatment.\"],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Cleft of the lip, the alveolar process and the palate (CLP) is the most common congenital malformation of the head. Whereas the cleft lip is a malformation that affects aesthetics, cleft palate is a malformation that affects function. Functional disorders due to a palatal cleft include problems of nutrition, swallowing, breathing and grimacing. Moreover, speech and voice quality are commonly affected.  Speech and voice disorders may persist after repair of the palatal cleft. Speech is primarily affected by hypernasality or increased nasal resonance as well as nasal air escape, and secondarily by misarticulations, decreased intelligibility and hoarseness. Hypernasality and nasal air escape are commonly treated by surgery, while misarticulations and hoarseness are treated by speech therapy.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe superiorly based posterior pharyngeal wall flap with a Z-plasty to cover the wound surface of the flap is one of the surgical techniques that can be used to treat hypernasality in speech due to velopharyngeal insufficiency. Velopharyngeal insufficiency occurs when the soft palate is unable to separate the oropharynx from the nasopharynx. Hypernasality is one of the parameters that may influence intelligibility of speech. As speech is the cornerstone of social integration and peer acceptance, the ultimate goal of the flap operation is to obtain speech with a normal nasal resonance and with a pleasing quality. However, if after pharyngeal flap surgery speech outcome with regard to hypernasality is disappointing, revisional surgery is usually performed in order to obtain a more favourable outcome. The incidence of revisional surgery may be used as a measure to describe speech outcome after pharyngeal flap surgery. To assess speech before and after pharyngeal flap surgery, as well perceptual judgment as instrumental measures can be performed. In clinical situation, the perceptual impression is the first tool used to judge the severity of the abnormalities in speech before and after therapy. For scientific reasons it is important to know the reliability of the perceptual judgment. Unfortunately, the current research points out that the reliability of this perceptual judgment is only moderate. For a more objective support for diagnosis and decision making for therapy, instruments to measure hypernasality in speech have been developed. One of these instruments is the Nasometer®. The nasometer claims to provide measures which are based on physiology. During standardized speech, nasal acoustic energy is measured separately from oral acoustic energy. The ratio of acoustic energy proceeding from the nasal cavity and the total acoustic energy is used as a measure for nasal resonance. The correlation between the perceptual judgment and the instrumental measure is an important issue. From the current research appears that the correlation between perception and nasometry is only moderate, probably meaning that measurement by nasometry and judgment by perception reflects different dimensions of speech. Therefore, acoustic nasometry must not be considered as a substitute for the perceptual judgment, but as a tool to quantify nasal resonance before and after therapy as part of a multidimensional diagnostic process (beside aerodynamics, imaging and self-evaluation).'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['MRI follow-up of abdominal aortic aneurysms after endovascular repair'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['Aneurysm size changes form the basis of the follow-up after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, because aneurysm growth increases rupture risk. Aneurysm growth can be caused by endoleak (leakage of blood in the aneurysm sac). Therefore, accurate endoleak detection is important in growing aneurysms, because it can provide a treatment target to stop aneurysm growth. MRI has been shown to be more sensitive to endoleak than CT. In this thesis we report on the use of MRI in the follow-up of abdominal aortic aneurysms after endovascular repair. First, the use of MRI with a blood pool contrast agent for the detection of slow-flow endoleak is described. Gadofosveset trisodium, a gadolinium-based agent that binds to albumin, is used as contrast agent. The albumin binding causes a long retention time of the contrast agent in the vascular system, which allows for a longer delay between injection and imaging than conventional extracellular contrast agents. In Chapter 2 the value of blood pool contrast agent-enhanced MRI for endoleak detection is investigated in patients who present with nonshrinking aneurysms more than a year after EVAR, without evidence of endoleak on CTA and delayed CT. In 55 % of the MRI exams endoleaks were visualized. Especially the late phase postcontrast imaging 30 minutes after injection proved valuable for endoleak detection. In Chapter 3 graft porosity is visualized with this technique in patients with an original Excluder endograft. In vitro, the presumed porosity of this graft was demonstrated before. With blood pool contrast agent-enhanced MRI, graft porosity is visualized in vivo for the first time. A clear increase in signal intensity around the endograft can be observed in the postcontrast images which were acquired 30 minutes after injection. In the following chapters the superior soft tissue contrast of MRI is used for the visualization of aneurysm sac contents. In Chapter 4 we present a method to measure endoleak volume, unorganized thrombus volume and organized thrombus volume. In Chapter 5 the method is applied to patients with nonshrinking aneurysms more than a year after EVAR. This work demonstrates that – even years after EVAR – half of the nonshrinking aneurysm sac contents still consists of unorganized thrombus, irrespective of the presence of endoleaks. In Chapter 6 the longitudinal analysis of aneurysm sac contents in patients in the first year after EVAR is reported in relation with changes in aneurysm volume on long-term CT-follow up. Progressive organization of aneurysm sac contents is demonstrated which is reflected by an increase in the amount of organized thrombus volume and a decrease in unorganized thrombus volume in time. After one year still one third of the aneurysm sac consists of unorganized thrombus. No difference in the evolution of the aneurysm sac is found between stable, shrinking and growing aneurysms. Concludingly,slow-flow endoleaks can be detected with MRI with a blood pool contrast agent, and aneurysm sac contents can be visualized and monitored with MRI. Further longitudinal studies with MRI could eventually provide more clarity on the processes in the aneurysm sac after EVAR'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['The development of cancer is an evolutionary process with accumulating (epi)genetic alterations underlying the transformation of a normal cell into a potentially malignant population. Cancer cells may continue to depend on the presence of such (epi)genetic alterations for maintenance of their malignant phenotype. Concurrently, cancer cells may develop an increased dependency on the function of genes that are not affected by (epi)genetic alterations. These dependencies, named oncogene and non-oncogene addiction, are discussed in this thesis. The identification of genetic dependencies that are specific to cancer can guide the development of therapeutic agents for the treatment of cancer. This thesis describes three distinct studies in which functional genomic screens based on RNA interference (RNAi) have been employed to identify such cancer cell specific dependencies, genes involved in therapy response and regulators of a key signalling network that is often deregulat ed in cancer. The three studies presented in this thesis illustrate the versatility of RNAi-based screens in cancer research. In addition, they provided us with new insight in the regulation of NF-kB signalling and candidate drug targets in cancers driven by the yet intractable RAS oncoproteins. Hence, KIF18A represents a novel candidate drug target for the treatment of cancers driven by RAS oncoproteins. In the first study we performed an RNAi screen for regulators of TNFa-induced activation of NF-kb, a family of transcription factors implicated in immunity, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. We describe the identification of FBXO7, a component of SCF-ubiquitin ligase complexes, as a negative regulator of NF-kB signalling. We show that FBXO7 binds to, and mediates ubiquitination of, cIAP1 and TRAF2, resulting in decreased ubiquitination of RIP1 kinase and lowered NF-kB signalling activity. In the second study presented in this thesis, we screened for genes involved in ce llular response to cisplatin, a cytotoxic agent commonly used to treat a variety of cancers. Although we did not discover novel regulators of cellular response mechanisms to cisplatin treatment, our results confirm previous findings and underscore the importance of DNA damage response signalling, homologous recombination and translesion synthesis in the repair of cisplatin-induced DNA damage. The third and last study presented in this thesis involves a screen for novel drug targets in cancer. Despite ample evidence that cancer cells positive for RAS oncoproteins may depend on RAS activity for their survival, there are currently no treatment strategies that specifically target RAS oncoproteins. Therefore, we performed an RNAi screen to identify genetic dependencies associated with the expression of oncogenic RAS. We identified several genes, including kinesin family member 18A (KIF18A), whose suppression results in impaired proliferation and survival of human fibroblasts that express th e H-, K- or N-RAS oncogene. We found that silencing of KIF18A causes a mitotic arrest and that is associated with an increase in apoptosis. More important, we found a correlation between the effects of KIF18A silencing and the RAS mutation status in a panel of Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer cell lines, suggesting that the increased dependency on KIF18A function associated with the expression of oncogenic RAS is not restricted to fibroblasts. Hence, KIF18A represents a novel candidate drug target for the treatment of cancers driven by RAS oncoproteins.'],\n",

       "  'Title': ['Characterization of two types of prostasomes with distinct molecular compositions'],\n",
       "  'Description': ['During the last years it has become evident that many different cell types can communicate with each other through intercellular transfer of extracellular vesicles. Such cell-derived membrane vesicles function in several physiological processes and also in disease. This thesis describes two subclasses of prostasomes, extracellular vesicles that are released by prostate epithelial cells and ultimately enter the seminal plasma. Prostasomes stimulate sperm cell motility and influence sperm cell capacitation and the acrosome reaction, all of which are prerequisites for successful fertilization. Furthermore, prostasomes suppress immune-mediated destruction of sperm cells in the female reproductive tract. However, the exact molecular mechanisms through which prostasomes exert such diverse functions remain largely unknown. In the studies described in this thesis, prostasomes were purified and their protein, lipid and nucleic acid contents characterized. This resulted in the definition of two distinct types of prostasomes, a smaller (50 nm) and a larger (100 nm) type, which may perform different functions. The two prostasome types have distinct protein and lipid compositions. Many other types of extracellular vesicles are known to contain RNA, which may elicit epigenetic effects in their target cells. However, the RNA content of prostasomes had not been explored. In the research described in this thesis, RNA was found associated with the large prostasomes. Deep sequencing of this RNA showed that the majority is composed of a type that had not been described before. Physiological target cells for the larger prostasomes, and hence for their RNA contents, remained unknown. Given its unique composition, prostasomal RNA may serve as a biomarker of prostate cancer. The blood of healthy men is devoid of prostasomes, but in case of prostate cancer prostasomes may reach the blood stream as well. Comparison of prostasomal RNA from prostate cancer patients with that of healthy men, either from blood, urine or seminal plasma, may provide new insights in its potential as cancer biomarker. The interactions between small prostasomes and sperm cells during sperm cell capacitation were studied in an equine model. Small prostasomes were found to bind to sperm cells, but only at conditions that favoured sperm cell capacitation. Moreover, recruited prostasomes reduced the degree of protein tyrosine phosphorylation in sperm cells, which is a hallmark of a late phase in sperm cell capacitation. Prostasomes may therefore help to prevent premature full capacitation of sperm cells and their acrosome reaction. Other studies showed that transfer of progesterone receptors to the sperm cells through fusion of prostasomes with their plasma membrane. Once the sperm cells have reached the progesterone-secreting cumulus cells that surround the oocyte, transfer of progesterone receptors by prostasomes may assist the progesterone-dependent stimulation of sperm cell hypermotility and the acrosome reaction. Thus, prostasomes may bind and accompany sperm cells on their journey to the oocyte, and fuse with the sperm cells only upon their approach of an oocyte, providing them with tools that are required for effective oocyte fertilization'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIv) of H5 and H7 subtypes are able to mutate to highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIv), which are lethal for most poultry species, can cause large epidemics and are a serious threat to public health. Thus, circulation of these LPAIv in poultry is undesirable. To date, these mutations cannot be reliably predicted and they can already take place within the first infected farm. Early detection and eradication of LPAI infected farms would minimise the probability of this mutations to happen. Because LPAI infections are associated with mild and unspecific clinical signs, detection of infected flocks is mainly based on serological surveillance.The goal of this thesis was to develop the framework of a serological surveillance programme for early detection of LPAI. Data of the current surveillance programmes in the European Union and the Netherlands were evaluated to quantify the risk of introduction of a LPAIv into the different poultry sectors. It was shown that among the different chicken production sectors in the Netherland, layer chicken flocks, in particular outdoor layers, have the highest risk of infection with LPAIv. In addition, chicken layers are often located in areas of high flock density, which increases the risk of spread of infection between flocks, and with that, the likelihood of mutation to HPAI. Thus, the need of implementing a science based early detection system was justified. However, early detection may lead to high (blood) sampling frequency, which increases the cost of the programme and affects animal welfare. Eggs could be used as sample alternative. Therefore, its use for surveillance was evaluated economically. It was shown that – under the current programme – surveillance based on egg sampling appears to be equally effective to and cheaper than blood sampling. To be able to calculate sample size and sampling frequency to design surveillance, the population dynamics of the infection have to be considered. The within and between farm transmission of LPAI was studied using transmission experiments and field data. This information together with information about the performance of the diagnostic test used for surveillance (testing either egg-yolk or sera samples) were combined to develop a mathematical model to design a risk based serological surveillance programme that aims at early detecting LPAI outbreaks. This model quantitatively identifies areas with flocks with high or low risk of transmission, where an specific sampling strategy (sample size and sampling frequency) is applied according to the area’s (flocks) risk of transmission. An output-based surveillance approach is recommended. This programme would target early detection in outdoor-layer flocks located in areas with high risk of transmission. In areas of low risk of transmission, surveillance could be performed aiming at substantiating absence of infection, for trading purposes. In this thesis, epidemiological and economical tools are provided that could aid the selection of an epidemiologically effective and economically efficient programme. A risk based programme, as suggested here, would be cheaper than the current surveillance programme and would contribute to minimise the risk of mutations of LPAIv to HPAIv.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Atherosclerosis causes major invalidating and fatal events, and is a major contributing factor to the burden of cardiovascular disease, which is the number one cause of death globally. The initiation of atherosclerosis already starts in utero, but generally becomes clinically apparent during adulthood. The reason for clinical events to occur is closely associated with the underlying plaque composition. Especially for the coronary arteries, postmortem studies have revealed that atherosclerotic plaque rupture is frequently found in coronary plaques from patients who died from myocardial infarction. Also for carotid arteries symptoms including stroke and transient ischemic attack have been associated with vulnerable underlying plaque characteristics. Due to the systemic nature of atherosclerosis, and pathophysiological involvement of inflammatory responses it has been suggested that some individuals have a systemic predisposition to irregularity and rupture of atherosclerotic plaques, independent of traditional vascular risk factors. This resulted in initiation of biobanking studies, linking local atherosclerotic plaque features to patient characteristics. The Athero-Express Biobank study started in 2002 with the atherosclerotic plaque harvested during carotid endarterectomy as a starting point, followed by a three year follow up and registration of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. This unique design facilitated cross sectional but also prospective cohort research, and served as the foundation for this thesis.

       "  'Description': ['This PhD thesis focuses on the endoscopic treatment of benign and malignant dysphagia and delayed gastric emptying. Dysphagia due to a benign anastomotic stricture occurs in 40% of patients after esophagectomy and often requires ongoing endoscopic dilations. We evaluated whether corticosteroid injections added to dilation improves clinical outcome. We found a non- significant improvement in total number of dilations needed or dysphagia free period, and a higher risk of candida esophagtis in the patients treated with corticosteroids and cannot recommended steroid injections for this indication. Esophageal stent placement is considered to provide a longer dysphagia free period, but in benign strictures stent removal can be challenging due to esophageal imbedment as a result of hyperplastic tissue. By placing a second stent in the originally placed stent, pressure necrosis of hyperplastic tissue occurs, which ensures safe stent removal. We demonstrated that this stent-in-stent technique is a safe way to remove embedded esophageal stents. Another option is to place biodegradable stent, made of polydioxanone, which gradually degrades over 3 months time. We demonstrated that, although a considerable number of side effects occurred, this stent was effective in the treatment of dysphagia. For malignant dysphagia due to esophageal cancer, stent placement provides immediate dysphagia relief, while endoluminal radiotherapy provides better long term results. We evaluated whether a combination of both treatments would result in both an immediate and long-term dysphagia free period. A biodegradable stent (which is dissolved after 3months) instead of a metal stent was used to avoid long term stent complications. We showed that this combination treatment did not increase dysphagia free period, but was associated with a high number of complications, such as retrostenal pain, nausea and vomiting. We also performed radial and axial force tests in vitro of various stents in an attempt to explain clinical finding after stent placement. Although we experienced that the behavior of an esophageal stent is a complex issue that cannot be explained by radial and axial force alone, we hypothesize that a high radial force and a low axial force may be the optimal combination of an effective a-traumatic esophageal stent. Delayed gastric emptying is a common complication after abdominal surgery or in critically ill patients, which often requires nasoenteral tube feeding. In clinical practice, we noticed that after transnasal endoscopic feeding tube placement feeding tubes are often still located in the stomach, due to spontaneous retrograde feeding tube migration or inadequate placement. By performing clip-assisted feeding tube placement we aimed to reduce the number of feeding tubes that were located in the stomach. In this study we showed that this technique was effective: by performing 5 clip-assisted feeding tube placements, we avoided 1 repeat endoscopy for incorrect tube placement.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['In this PhD thesis participation in leisure activities of children and youth aged 2 to 18 years with and without a physical disability in the Netherlands is described. Determinants of participation are identified. Participation is someone’s involvement in life situations (ICF-CY, WHO). This thesis focuses on leisure activities in particular. Leisure activities are those activities that are freely chosen and performed when not involved in school or work. Although there has been a growing body of literature into participation and determinants of participation in leisure activities, comparisons between children with and without physical disabilities were lacking. In order to measure participation in a valid and reliable way, two measures were translated from English into Dutch and assessed in a large group of children with and without a physical disability. For children aged 2 to 6 years of age the Assessment of Preschool Children’s Participation (APCP) was assessed. For children and adolescents aged 6 to 18 years of age the Dutch translation of the Children’s Assessment of Participation and Enjoyment (CAPE) was assessed. Both showed satisfactory psychometric properties. With these instruments a comparison between children with and without physical disabilities was made showing lower levels of participation for children with a physical disability. An extensive literature review, aimed at identifying determinants of participation in leisure activities, showed a wide range of factors being involved in the level of participation. Most important variables are gross motor function, manual ability, cognitive ability, communicative skills, age and gender. Related variables are comparable across diagnostic groups. Preference is one of the factors related to participation in leisure activities. The relation between preference for activities and actual engagement in activities is also assessed. Children with a physical disability have lower preference for physical activities, social activities and informal activities compared to their healthy peers. A prospective study looking at early determinants of participation in children with Cerebral Palsy (CP) at the age of 2, and participation at the age of 6,7 or 8 years, used multivariate regression analysis and showed that movement ability and social skills to be the best predictors of later participation in leisure activities. Another important finding is that the feeling of parents of being restricted in undertaking activities with the family when the child was 2 years of age, was also related to lower participation when the child was 6,7 or 8 years old. An international comparison study was undertaken comparing Spanish and Dutch children with CP and their non-disabled peers. Spanish children with CP showed more participation in formal activities and skill-based activities compared to Dutch peers. Looking at determinants of variance in participation between children, regression analyses showed that child related variables (age, gender, GMFCS) were related to participation in leisure activities. Country of residence was only related for participation in formal activities. Clinical implications and future research are discussed.'],\n",

       "  'Description': ['Anticancer drugs themselves can cause adverse health effects when administered to human patients. In addition, it has become apparent that personnel in human medicine, occupationally exposed to these anticancer drugs, may also be at risk. The past decades, the use of chemotherapy in veterinary medicine has been gaining popularity. Consequently, an increasing number of people in veterinary medicine may be exposed to anticancer drugs. This raises the question whether veterinary personnel and owners of treated pets may be at risk as well. However, little is known about exposure in this setting. The aim of this thesis, therefore, is to assess exposure to anticancer drugs in veterinary oncology and to evaluate the efficacy of the current veterinary guidelines on safe handling of antineoplastic drugs, treated pets and wastes. Since pet-dogs are the main group of veterinary patients treated with anticancer drugs, we have focused on this group. Potential sources of exposure are excretion products of treated pets and contaminated surfaces. Antineoplastic drug residues were detected in urine, feces and saliva up to three weeks after administration of carboplatin, doxorubicin or epirubicin to pet-dogs. Moreover, residues were found in sebum and cerumen of pet-dogs treated with carboplatin, up to three weeks after dosing. When a slow release carboplatin drug delivery formulation was used, excretion occurred at higher levels, up to at least four weeks after administration. As a result, the periods of risk considered by the veterinary guidelines on safe handling of antineoplastic drugs, treated pets and wastes may not be adequate to keep exposure at low levels. Environmental contamination with antineoplastic drug residues was generally low in veterinary oncology centers and homes of treated pet-dogs. Furthermore, the presence of residues of carboplatin was monitored on surfaces in human oncology settings. Environmental contamination was higher in human oncology units and slightly lower in homes of treated human cancer patients. In all instances in veterinary and human oncology, surface contamination indicated that dispersion of antineoplastic drug residues by people occurred. Potential uptake of residues of carboplatin, doxorubicin and epirubicin was evaluated in people at risk of exposure. The veterinary guidelines were able to avert uptake of antineoplastic drug residues by veterinary personnel. On the other hand, uptake could not be prevented in some of the owners of pet-dogs treated with carboplatin, doxorubicin or epirubicin. Residues of doxorubicin and epirubicin have cytotoxic and cardiotoxic potency. In addition, some of the platinum species in urine samples from pet-dogs treated with carboplatin have DNA-binding capacity. However, the true health risks associated with the exposure as reported in this thesis are difficult to measure and still remain to be established.'],\n",
