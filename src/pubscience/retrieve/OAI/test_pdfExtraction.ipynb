       " \"1. INTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE OF THE STUDY\\n\\nCerebral arterial disease is one of the most perplexing subjects physician\\n‘an study. Thief not Because of the vagaries of vascular disease but because\\n‘of the complesity ofthe brain and the selective vulnerability fs many parts\\n1 ischaemia, Diseases ofthe cerebral arterial system wally occu late i fe\\n‘against a background of widespread long-standing vascular changes in many\\n‘other organs ofthe body. Often the function ofthe heat, kidoey and limb\\n‘esels is similarly impaired by disease and hypertension isan ade feature\\n‘in many cases, Atheromatous cerebral arterial ease, even more thas coro\\nnary artery disease is but one facet ofa generalized dnorder. Cerebral infare-\\nton rarely has a single cause. Usually its the result of both obstraction in\\ncexeraranial or intracranial cerebral arteries and systemic disease. During the\\nlast decades many stodies appear to have shown that local intracranial factors\\nare ess important than extracranial factors in the production of transient and\\npersistent cerebral deficits. AS a result of these investigations there i large\\n‘body of information concerning the pathological effets of atherosclerotic\\nlesions of the carotid arteries on the brain. Because this part ofthe cerebro-\\n‘vascular system is easily acessble 10 dingnostic techniques an surgical pro-\\ncedures, there isan increasing imeres about the detection and treatment of is\\npathology.\\n\\n‘Wien reviewing the literature one may forget that atherosclerosis isa dif\\nfase proces, ad that the hua brain obtains its vascular supply by four\\n‘main arteries: the carotids and the vertebals. On the other hand anatomical,\\n‘pathological, and clinical zudies have delineated the importance of collateral\\nCirculation between the carotid and the vertebrobasilar territories. An anon:\\n‘lous circle of Wills with a hypoplastic posterior communicating artery for\\n‘cxample, is particularly associated with increased vulnerability to stroke\\n(Weery, 1961, Alpers eta, 1963). Involvement ofthe vertebrobai\\n‘system by the atherosclerotic process increases the stroke risk of\\n‘obstructive lesions of the caroud areres (Henneril eta, 1982) Similarly,\\nbecaste of the interdependence of the carotid and vertebrobasilar system's\\n‘andthe variability ofthe origin of the dominant blood supply tothe posterioe\\n‘cerebral arteries, carotid obstructive disease may present iself with the clin\\ncal picture of vertebrobasilar iSchgemia and vice versa (Haferkamp otal,\\n1974, Veda et al, 1979, Bogousslavsty eal, 1983, 1984, 1988)\\n\\n‘Many symptoms of cerebrovascular insufficiency are infact du fo extra-\\ncranial diseae of the carotid arteries. However, in many studies dealing with\\nCerebral ischaemia, information about the status of the vertebrobasilar arte\\n‘lal system i lacking. Since the vertebral arteries are often as lage a8, and\\nsometimes larger than, the internal carotid arteries atthe point where they\\n‘enerate the dura, and since they supply the vital centres of the brain stem\\n\\n\",\n",
       " 'this omission is remarkable. A probable reason is tha the vertebral arteries\\ntake a rather inaccessible course for diagnostic investigation and surgical\\nlreatment, Another important reason may be that vertebral artery obstruc-\\ntions are les straightforward than obstructive lesions in the carotid artery,\\nland the haemodynamics of vertebrobasilar arterial insufficiency are more\\ncomplicated. However, the most important reason is that physicians have\\nfailed to comprehend the frequency of atherosclerosis of the innominate,\\nsubclavian, and vertebral arteries and its relation to cerebral ischaemia. Re\\nports on the outcome of vertebrobasilar transient ischaemic attacks are less\\nconsistent than those ofthe anterior circulation. Consequently, theresa lack\\n‘of consensus among clinicians on the management of patients with vertebro-\\nbasilar arterial disease.\\n\\nInadequacy of angiographic criteria forthe interpretation of obstructions\\nfof the vercbra arteries, difficulties of the radiological technique, and the\\nsometimes dramatic complications following vertebral angiography all con-\\ntribute to the limited knowledge of the clinical significance of atherosclerosis\\nof the vertebrobasilar arterial system. It has been reported that non-invasive\\nDoppler techniques are of help in making an individual eximation of the\\nSeverity of disease of the innominate, subclavian, and vertebral ates\\n‘Quantitative information, however, is dificult to obtain, The main problems\\nare the investigation of the proximal part of the vertebral artery and the\\nAifferentation of severe stenosis, occlusion, hypoplasia and aplasia. At pee-\\nSent no reports are available about the accuracy of ultrasoni duplex scanning\\n(of the innominate, subclavian and vertebral arteries. Ultrasonic duplex scan\\nring is a combination of two-dimensional imaging of the vesels of interest.\\nand Doppler measurement, using a single gated pulsed system. It provides the\\n‘advantage of ether technique used independently and in adition to audible\\nlnterpeetation realtime spectral analysis of the Doppler signals i used (0\\nevaluate the degree of disease. The ultrasonic image of the arteries is an\\n‘anatomical guide by which one is informed about the exact location and\\ncourse of the vessels of interest, The investigation ofthe vessels ofthe aortic\\narch, and the ostium and the proximal part ofthe vertebral artery is usualy\\n‘ota problem, It has the additional advantage of investigating the vertebral\\nartery in its bony canal until it loops around the ala.\\n\\n‘The purpose of this study is 10 evaluate uliasonic duplex scanning in\\ntracing obstructive disease of the innominate, subclavian and verebral art\\n‘es and in particular 1 assess its accuracy and clinical value. The results are\\n‘compared withthe results of contrast arteriography and they are reviewed\\nSeparately for cach ofthe three vessels mentioned above\\n\\n1 is als investigated whether there is any relation between different intra\\ncranial arterial distribution patterns in selective carotid and vertebral contrast,\\n\\nw\\n',\n",

On both sides the vertebral artery i usually the fist\\nbranch of the subclavian artery. It runs up the transverse foramina of the\\nupper cervical vertebrae, enters the skull hough the foramen magnum and\\n‘connects with its counterpart on the other side to form the vertebrobasilar\\narterial system\\n\\n‘Any discussion om disease of the vertebrobasilar arterial sytem should\\nbegin with the origin ofthis vascular system, because obstructive disease,\\ntlcerative plaques or anatomical anomalies anywhere in this part of the ere\\nbrovascular tee may produce stroke or symptoms of insufficiency.

As the examination ofthe carotid system\\nfalls beyond the scope of ths study, the anatomy of the common carotid\\narteries is only briefly mentioned and not discussed in detail.

They ae briefly summarized here and some of\\nthem are shown in figure 2.2/1. Sometimes the aorta arches over the rot of\\n‘the right Tung instead of that ofthe left lung. This right aortic arch passes\\ndownwards on the ight side ofthe vertebral column, In this condition, which\\nisnormal in birds, there is usually transposition of the thoracic and abdomi-\\nnal viscera. Less frequently, after arching ove the root ofthe right lung, the\\nsorta passes behind the esophagus 1 gain its postion on the left sie ofthe\\nvertebral column. This anatomical pecularit is not associated with ranspos-\\ntion of the viscera, In this case the left subclavian artery arses asthe last\\n‘ranch from tha arch, and crosses behind the oesophagus enroute the let\\nUpper extremity\\n\\n‘The aorta occasionally divides, asin some quadriceps, into an ascending\\nand descending trunk. The former is diceced vertically upwards, an subdivi-\\ndes into three branches to supply the head and the upper limbs. Sometimes\\nthe aorta subdivides nea its origin into two branches, which soon reunite. In\\nthis condition, which is normal in repiles and is due 1o persistence of apart\\nofthe right dorsal aorta, the oesophagus andthe trachea usually pass through\\n{he interval between the wo branches.\\n\\n‘Three branches arse from the upper aspect ofthe aortic atch the brachio-\\ncephalic trunk, the left common carotid and the left subclavian arteries. At\\n‘heir origins the distance between these vessels varies. The mos frequent\\nvatiation inthis respect i the approximation of the left common carotid\\nartery tothe brachiocephalic trunk. The branches may arise from the com-\\n‘mencement of the arch or upper par of the ascending aot\\n\\n“The numberof primary branches may be reduced to one. More commonly\\nthere are two (Fig. 2.2/Ia): in 7% ofthe cass the left common carotid artery\\narises from the brachiocephalic trunk (White, 1969). More rarely the com\\n‘mon carotid and subclavian arteries of the let sie aris from a left rachio-\\n‘cephalic trunk. Bu the mumber of branches may increase to four, because the\\nFight common carotid andthe subclavian arteries may arse divcty from the\\naorta. In most of these cases the right subclavian artery arises from the let\\nfend of the ach and passes tothe right behind the aorta.

INTRODUCTION\\n\\n‘The human brain may be considered as a biological computer, which is\\ncomposed of bilions of cells and circuits that make it the most sophisticated\\n‘organism in the universe that we know of. This computer has only one severe\\n‘problem: its extremely dependent on a continuous and adequate supply of\\n‘oxygen and glucose. It may be considered tobe obligatory aerobe, thai, it\\nderives al ofits energy from the oxidative metabolism of glucose. In order to\\n‘maintain this condition oxygen mast be present and of sufficiently high con-\\n‘centration inthe brain se. A relative high average capillary oxygen tension\\n‘of approximately 60 ramble is necessary forthe maintenance of oxygen ten\\n‘sion above the critical value of 1 10 2 mmHg in cells furthest away from the\\nCapillaries, There i sill disagreement concerning the question whether OX:\\n‘yen is supplied tothe tissue only by diffusion or that glial cells play some\\n‘ole inthe oxygen transfer from the blood to the nerve cells (McHenry, 1983).\\n\\nAlthough the brain represents only approximately 2% of body weight, at\\n‘et it wilzes 20-25% of the oxygen inspired and needs about 80 mg gicose\\n‘er minute, As cerebral energy metabolism takes place in the mitochondria of\\n‘the cell, it is understandable that the demand for oxygen and glucose differ\\nfrom one region to another. Roy and Sherrington showed in 1890 the fanda-\\n‘mental importance of cerebral metabolism asthe primary factor inthe regu\\nlation ofthe cerebral circulation, Recent studies on cerebral metabolism show\\nthat focal changes of blood flow occur in a variety of physiological circum:\\nstances. For example, one may demonstrate an increase in regional cerebral\\nblood flow in the occipital cortex by retinal light stimulation, and regional\\nmetabolism in the precental motor coriex increases with exercise of the op-\\nposite extremity (Lassen etal, 1978, Olesen, 1971), Thse differences, how.\\n‘vet, ae relatively small and asa whole brain metabolism and cerebral Mood\\nflow are only slightly enbanced by cerebral activation.\\n\\nThe normal average blood Now through the brain sssue is about 60 ml\\n‘/min/100 gram, For the ota ain this amounts 10 900-1100 mil/mia.. which\\nIsabowt 156 of the resting cardiac output, The above mentioned valve isa\\n‘mean value, regional differences are present.

Strictly de:\\nfined, autoregulation is restricted to control by intrinsic mechanisms, that is,\\nto mechanisms remaining in a denervated organ without autonomic contol\\n“Moat ofthe observations of constant cerebral blood flow during changes in\\nperfusion presture were made with autonomic innervation of the cerebal\\n‘vessel intact. Carefully defined, the resus of these studies donot appropei-\\nately describe autoregulation. However, there is strong evidence tha the\\nregulatory mechanisms are almost completely independent of sructures out-\\nse the cranial cavity,\\n\\nCerebral blood flow is determined by the pressure gradient between the\\n{input and output of the system and by the cerebrovascular resistance. Under\\nphysiological condition the perfusion pressure ofthe brain is maialy deter-\\n‘mined by the mean arterial blood presure; the intracranial and venous pres-\\nsures having alow vale. The resistance of the cerebal vasculature is determi\\n‘ed bythe resistance in the callie and in the arterioles. The former can be\\nassumed 0 be constant because in the brain there are no possiblities of\\n‘shutting of oF opening important parts ofthe capillary system. Because of the\\nconstant high metabolic need for the neurons such a mechanism could not\\nexist inthe brain. Thus, the cerebrovascular resistance i mainly located inthe\\narterioles, These vessels have the ability 10 dilate oF to constrict within a\\n‘certain range so that the total cerebrovascular resistance varies between cet-\\n{ain limits, This mechanism makes it possible for the brain fo maintain a\\nconstant cerebral blood flow whichis to a large extent independent of the\\n‘mean arterial blood pressure,\\n\\n‘The most important determinant of cerebral blood flow is the carbon\\n‘oxide tension in arterial blood. Although the occurrence of cerebral vasodila-\\n{ation in response to increased arterial carbon dione tension, and of cere-\\nbral vasoconstriction in response to decreased arterial carbon dioxide tension\\n‘an be constantly demonstrated, the exact mechanism involved is not known.\\n1 has been postulated that change in pH of the extracellular Med around the\\narterioles and not the change in carbon dioxide tension itself isthe simalus\\nby which arterial carbon dione controls cerebral blood flow.

However,\\nsponses to changes in arterial oxygen tension are ess pronounced than the\\n‘responses caused by changes in arterial carbon dioxide tension.

The association of\\ntransient inchaemic attacks with occlusion ora tght stenonis ofthe carotid of\\n‘vertebral arteries suggests that a reduced perfusion might be enough to cause\\ntransient focal symptoms. This haemodynamic view of transient ischaemic\\nattacks was advocated by Deany-Brown and co-workers (1957), who pro-\\n‘duced 2 neurological deficit in the monkey by inducing hypotension after\\n‘occluding the middle cerebral artery. That this mechnism can operate in\\npatients and cause transient, focal neurological deficit is well established\\n(astcot etal, 1954, Shanbiom eta, 1957, Ruff etal, 1981 and Riley et\\naL. 1981), A postural hypotersion, « haemodynamically significant cardiac\\narrythmia or a cardiac decompensation induced by exercise may cause @\\n{ansicnt chaemic attack\\n\\n‘On the other hand systemic hypotension appears to be a relatively rare\\n‘cause of cetebal ischaemia since Mood pressure measured during attacks is\\n‘usually normal. Attempss to reproduce transient ichacmic attacks by redue-\\ntion of systemic blood pressure ae ineffective or ifthe reduction is severe,\\nTos of consciousnen occurs due to generalised cerebral ischaemia (Kendell\\n\\nEy\\n',\n",

Tiss understandable since cerebral autoregula-\\ntion remains effective for along time even in the presence of arterial disease.\\n‘The precise range of blood pressure which will reduce blood flow in one\\n‘egion of the brain while maintaining an adequate low to other regions i\\nnarrow one. Usually focal symptoms are likely 10 develop only when a local\\nvascular obstruction makes one cerebral tettory mote vulnerable to a drop,\\nin perfusion pressure. Ruff and co-workers (1981) demonstrated that acute\\nlowering of blood pressure through antihypertensive medication, postural\\nchanges or cerebral angiography was associated with transient focal neuto-\\nlogical deficit in hypertensive patients with haemodyaamically significant\\n‘common of internal carotid arery stenouis. In some of these patients the\\nangiography also showed intracranial atheroscerons i a distribution which\\ncorresponded 10 the focal neurological deficit present during the transient\\nIschaemic attacks. tn their study ransent ischaemic attacks were related 10\\nhypotension in only 5.3% ofthe patents. The incidence. however, rose sig\\n‘nificantly 10 259% in patients with haemodynamically significant carotid ar\\ntery stenosis and to 4449 in patients with carotid artery stenosis and hypeten-\\n‘sion. Although the pathophsiologcal bass forthe relationship between hy-\\nPotersion and teansin’ focal cerebral deficit cannot be derived from their\\nWork, the attacks may be due (othe fact tha the autoregulation reserve is\\n‘exhausted by compensation for reduced pressure in the circle of Wills, so\\n‘that any addtional haemodynamic crisis can provoke symptomatic cerebral\\nIschaemia, Attacks ofthis type more often affect the vertebrobasilar cicala-\\ntioo (Ross Russell, 1983) and this may account for theless serious prognosis\\n‘of transient achuomicatacks i this terttory.\\n\\nDifferent haemodynamic mechanisms can cause the transient appearance\\n‘f focal neurological deficit.

For this reason i i not surprising that a\\nreview of the teratut gives a significant difference inthe probability ofthe\\n‘occurrence of stroke in studies on patients with transient ischaemic attacks in\\nthe vertebrobasilar territory. Marshall (1964) and Ziegler and co-worker\\n(497), for example, noted a much better clinical outcome in patients with\\ntransient ischaemic attack in the vertebrobasilar system than inpatients with\\ntransient ischaemic attacks inthe caroid system. On the other hand, Caet-\\nlidge etal, (1977), Jones etal, (1980), and Patrick eta, (1980) found n0\\ndiference in stroke probability in these two subgroups. They suggested that\\ntransient ischaemic attacks in the vertebrobasilar arterial system have a grave\\nprognostic significance of persistent neutolopcal deficit and therefore need\\ntn adequate diagnonis and therapy.

Although transient ischaemic\\nattacks may occur in the teritory of any of the cerebral artries.there are\\n‘good reasons for distinguishing between those occurring in the caro tree\\n\\nind those which involve structures supplied by the vertebrobasilar arterial\\nsystem. This distinction isnot always simple, party because the atacks st\\n‘dom occur when a physician is available to examine the patient. Most fre-\\n‘quently, data is based on information gathered from the patients or their\\nfamilies. As might be expected, this may be inaccurate because the family\\n\\n‘usually excited and subjective, and the patients’ alernes, insight, judgement,\\n‘and memory may be impaired during the attack.\\n\\n“The frequency of transient ischaemic attacks inthe vertebrobasilar arterial\\nsystem is not precisely known. Recently in his textbook on cerebrovascular\\ndisorders Toole (1984) sated that 10 10 30%. of transient ischaemic attacks\\nInvolve the vertebrobasilar territory.

Within the framework of this section we shall not enter into\\n<etails. The suggested definitions are merely intended to clarity the anatom-\\ncal considerations and pathogenesis of spondylosis of the cervical vertebral\\ncolumns.\\n\\n‘The morphology of the articulations between the cervical vertebrae is of\\n‘reat importance. The lower five cervical vertebra are connected together by\\nthre joints: the intervertebral disc anteriory, the two zygopophyseal joints\\nposteriorly, and, in adtion 1o these, the newrocentral joints (ig. 5.3/1).

If an osteophyte, developing on the neurosent\\njoint extend laterally or one on the posterior joint extends anteriorly the\\nvertebral artery foramen may be encroached upon and the vertebral a\\nmay be comprested to a significant degre. Occasionally these osteophytes\\nmay produce severe kinking of the vertebral artery, resulting evenually i a\\nstenosis or thrombosis that may extend distally.\\n\\nDegenerative changes are not equally prevalent in all segments ofthe cervi-\\n‘al column. The most pronounced changes occur in the middle and lower\\nSegments between the fourth and seventh cervical vertebral bodies (Krosdah\\netal, 1940, Taylor, 1953, Tepe, 1986). In the unco-vertebra region degene-\\native changes have also been seen in higher segments (Krogdabl tal, 1940),\\n\\nIn their clnico pathological study of the cervical segment of the vertebral\\nartery, Hutchinson and Yates (1956) called attention tothe fact that distor-\\ntion of the vertebral artery was sometimes caused by bony changes in the\\nspine from cervical spondylosis. They proposed the possibilty that cervical\\nspondylosis, comman enough inthe same age group as signs and symptoms\\nof vertebrobasilar arterial insuficency and capable of distorting the ve\\n\\nbral artery, might play a subsidiary role in obstructing one or ther vertebral\\nartery during movement of the cervical spine. In ths respect is of great\\ninterest that some investigators (de Kleyn etal, 1933, Tatlow etal, 1987)\\ndescribed a decrease of vertebral ctculation on one side when the head was\\n‘turned backwards and to the opposite side in postmortem material.

The reason that symptoms of vertebrobasilar insufficiency do not occur\\n‘in normal individuals probably is that there is adequate circulation from the\\ncontralateral vertebral artery othe anterior circulation. In these studies the\\nvertebral artery was usually compressed atthe Ive ofthe atlanto-aial artc-\\nllation. However, in one cadaver with cervical spondylosis illustrated by\\n‘Tatiow and co-worker (1957), there was significant worsening of the com-\\npression ofthe ipsilateral vertebral artery by an osteophyte during rotation of\\nthe neck.

However, ina roentgenolo-\\nsic study on 46 patients with symptoms due to cerebrovascular disease oF\\ncervical spondylosis, Shechan and colleagues (1960) could confirm by ateio-\\n_taphy the compression of one or ether vrtebeal artery by osteophytes in 26\\n\\n‘arteriograms in the 26 patients in whom cervical spondylosis was cornfimed\\nby roenigenographic examination of the cervical spine with accompanying\\n‘compression of the vertebral arteries, certain features were considered 10 be\\n‘characteristic of this condition. In severe cavical spondyloss the cervical\\nsegment of the vertebral arery had a strikingly tortuous appearance, wi\\nimaltiple sigmoid curves, the lateral concavities of which lay opposite an\\nlververebral space. Stenosis was frequent and occlusion rare atthe point of\\n‘maximal concavity. Compression of the vertebral arteries by ostcophytes\\nmight increase on the sie opposite {0 which the head was twrned by set\\n‘ching. However, compression was more severe om the same side due to pres=\\nsure against the ostcophytes. The most common ste of vertebral artery dis\\nplacement was berween the fifth and sath and the fourth and fifth cervical\\nvertebrae. Less commonly, there was displacement between the third and\\noucth vertebrae. This rarely occurred between the second and third vere-\\ntrae.\\n\\n[At present the pathological changes of the cervical vertebrae and the signs\\nland symptoms duc 0 compression ofthe verebal artery in cervical spoedy-\\nToni are wel etaiished (Hardin eal, 1960, Hardin, 1982, Gray eal. 197\\nGiroux, 1982) Many ofthe patients aiso have symptoms and signs referable\\ntocompression of the cervical spinal cord and nerve rus.

ARTERIOGRAPHY\\n\\n‘Since the Portuguese neurologist Egas Moniz introduced radiological imag.\\ning of cerebral vesels with contrast media ito clinical neurology in 1927,\\n‘cerebral angiography has made impressive progress. This progress i linked to\\n‘an improved knowledge ofthe radioanstomy ofthe cerebral vasculature, at\\n‘well as 1 the introduction ofthe catheter method with selective angiography,\\nthe availabilty of safer contrast media and t0 the introduction of digital\\n‘subtraction angiography.\\n\\n‘The evolution of vertebral angiography was described extensively by\\n‘Schechter and colleagues in 1973. The desirability of a safe rotine procedure\\n‘andthe difficulties in elaborating such procedure are demonstrated by the\\nlange amber of methods proposed for vertebral arteriography. In 1933\\nMoniz and co-workers were the first to iniroduce vertebral arteriography.\\n‘The subclavian artery was exposed inthe supraclavicular fossa, andthe con.\\n‘rast medium was injected imo this artery at poin distal othe origin of the\\n‘vertebral artery Since that time, many direct and indirect methods have been\\nesctibed. Most ofthese techniques have been expel developed to vial\\n‘ne the intracranial branches ofthe posterior circulation as for example in the\\n‘vent of a cerebral tumor ora saccular aneurysm of the basilar artery. These\\n‘iret veciniques are of litte valve in diagnosing atherosclerotic disease ofthe\\nvertebrobasilar arterial system because its not possible o visualize he origin\\n(of the vertebral artery from the subclavian artery by a direct method. A\\n‘addtional disadvantage of these techniques isthe risk of introducing vascular\\n‘spasm. Apart from that, the danger of « mechanical lesion ofthe nerve roots\\n‘ofthe cervico-brachial plexus, a Browe-Sequard syndrome caused by intra-\\n‘ral injection of the contrast medium, and the formation of arteriovenous\\nfiatulae is always present.\\n\\nInthe last decade selective catheterisation ofthe branches ofthe aortic arch\\nthas been developed. While elaborating 2 method of thoracic aortography in\\n‘post mortem studies Radner and co-workers (1981) often observed that the\\ntip of the catheter deviated ito the vertebral artery. The dea then arose, that\\nin living subjects it might be pombe to guide a catheter ito the vertebral\\nartery and 10 perform vertebral arteriography by the injection of contrast\\n‘medium through the catheter. Radoer (1951) extensively described this\\n‘method in a study on 221 cases. The catheter was introduced under furosco-\\n‘i control and when i entered the vertebral artery 38% Diodrast was injec\\n{ea and the angiograms were made, The technique of vertebrobasilar arterio-\\n‘raphy by cathetersation was subsequently used and refined by such invest\\nfa10rs as Olson (1983), Hauge (1984), van den Berge al, (1963), Scat et\\nal, (1965), Takahashi eal, (1969), and Peeters, (1969)\\n\\n“\\n\\n',\n",

The indications and contraindications for\\ncerebral angiography as well asthe frequency and reasons of complications\\nare reviewed in dealin textbooks of cerebral angiography as for example by\\n[Newton and co-workers (1974) and Krayenbii and co-workers (1982). Here\\n‘only a brief survey of generally accepted ideas about predisposing factors,\\n‘and particularly about the complications of vertebral arteriography will be\\nven\\n\\n‘Owing to modern techniques and contrast media, the frequency of compli:\\n‘ations has decreased over the years. The published statistical data usually\\n‘does not reveal how much experience the individual examiner has. It does\\nshow, however, thatthe complication rates lower when the numberof cases,\\ntnd presumably the experience of the angiographer, is greater (Hessel et al.,\\n1981) Mani and colleagues (1978-4) made an analysis of 5,000 catheter cere-\\nbral arteriograms in two raining and wo nontraining hospitals. The evel of\\n‘experience of angiographers varied considerably between supervised fist and\\nsecond year radiology residents and fully trained neuroradiographers. The\\ncomplication rate for the training hospitals (2.9%) was significantly higher\\nthan that forthe nontraining hospitals (0.9%). However, the rates of perma-\\nrent complication were identical (0.1%). Therefore, the difference between\\nthe hospital groups may be explained by the number of transient complica-\\ntions, On the other hand, Olivecrona (1977) and Earnest and colleagues\\n(1984) found no statistically significant correlation between the length of\\nprocedure and neurologic complications,\\n\\nFurthermore, the underlying disease plays an important role inthe occu\\nFence of complications. The patient who has a disorder associated with re-\\n‘duced perfusion ofthe brain is at greater risk of suffering a neurologic com-\\nplication at cerebral arteriography than the patient with nocmal cerebral\\nblood flow. Thus patents with atherosclerotic disease involving the extrac\\nnial or intracranial vesels, cerebral emboli o\\n‘or decreased oxygen-carrying capacity\\n\\n‘The risk of cerebral arteriography i increased inthe elderly patient, espe-\\ncially in those which havea systematic vascular disease (Faught etal, 1979,\\nEarnest a, 1984). Hypotension, which reduces cerebral perfusion. is par”\\nticularly dangerous in this group of patients. The exact mechanism by which\\n‘complications occur ina state of reduced perfusion of the brain is uncertain\\n‘Various possiblities have been considered: hypoxia could potemite the toxic\\n\\n3\\n',\n",

Wishart (1971) carried outa thor\\n‘ough study on 447 catheersations ofthe vertebral and carotid arteries, There\\n‘was no remarkable difference between total complications rates inthe {wo\\nprocedures.

Temporary complications as unconsciousness, unilateral or bilat~\\n‘eral extremity weakness, blurting of vision and homonymous hemianopsia,\\n‘were described by most investigators in a small percentage of the examina:\\ntions. These symptoms were atributed to the toxic effec of contrat material\\nfon the brain parenchyma and were probably due to a disturbance in the\\nfunction ofthe blood-brain barrier after the injection ofthe contrast medivm\\nadiner, 1981),\\n\\n‘A serious technical problem of catheteristion, which also can produce\\n‘iscomfort i the patient, is plunging ofthe vertebral artery a its orifice by\\nthe catheter. In such cases the fate of contrast material flow through the\\nvertebral artery may be significantly decreased, Several authors have com:\\n‘mented on the development of vertebral artery spasm during catheter arterio-\\n‘raphy ofthis vese. There can be no doubt, that this does occur, particularly\\nafter prolonged attempt at cathetersation. It appears, however, that in most\\ncases in which the flow of the medium has been delayed or stopped in the\\nmore distal segments ofthe vertebeal artery, catheter plugging ofthe artery i\\ninvolved. Checking fora normal washout ofthe contrast medium during the\\n‘examination is particularly important with selective vertebral arteriography,\\nin which the diameter of the catheter relatively closely approximates the di\\nameter of the vertebral artery (Howland etal, 1964, Howieson et al, 1968).\\n‘Ordinarily, the angiographer will anticipate this problem by selecting the\\nlarger ofthe wo vetebeal arteries for the inventgation,\\n\\n6\\n',\n",
       " '6.1.2. ACCURACY OF CEREBRAL ARTERIOGRAPHY\\n\\nPhysicians have recognized that arteriography is primarily a morphological\\nstudy. Arteiographic visualization of the arteries includes the pattern of\\narterial supply 10 organs or specific anatomic locations the course of major\\nbranch chases and collaterals and the anatomic dtl ofthe circulation ina\\nparticular area of interest. In many instances an identification of these mor\\nphological details is the only information demanded of this investigation. In\\n‘some clinical circumstances, as for example, in atherosclerotic disease ofthe\\ninnominate-subclavian- vertebral arterial system, a prerequisite to accurate\\n‘diagnosis and treatment involves the identification of lesions which produce\\n‘symptoms by virtue of their effect om pressure and flow. In these circum-\\n‘stances, the reduction in the cross-sectional area ofthe vesel is irs estimated\\n‘and with this estimate an assesment i then made ofthe effect of this change\\n‘om presiure and flow. Finally, in some vessels such asthe carotid artery, more\\n<eualed information regarding the surface characteristics of plagues is of,\\nsnscrest\\n\\nshouldbe realized that these instances a great dea is demanded ofthe\\nareriography and ts not akogether unexpected that the potential for era is\\nconsiderable. While many of the problems are related to factors associated\\nwith interpretation, its not uncommon for technical deficiences inthe study\\nself 0 magnify these problems. Iti therefore somewhat surprising that in\\n‘spite of many years of extensive application in clinical practice and research\\n‘studies, a critical evaluation of the accuracy of arteriography has only been\\nperformed in recent years\\n\\n{In broad terms, evaluation ofthe accuracy of arteriography can be divided\\nito theee different groups. The frst group inclades all the staies which\\nattempt to relate arteiographic findings to pathologic studies, ether from\\nsurgical specimens or at autopsy. The second group inclades studies in which\\nunctional changes are assessed on the basis of aterigraphic changes and\\n‘compared with those measured by physiologic testing procedures. Finally. i\\nthe third group inra- and interobserver agreement is judged when subjective\\ninterpretation of areriograms is used. In view of our study of strasonic\\nduplex scanning of the innominate, subclavian and vertebral arteries this last\\nsroup isthe most interesting.\\n\\nessential tha the arteriograper is aware of the tendency of atherosle\\n‘oss to develop at major branch points and tifurcations in the arterial tee.\\nTn clinical neurology this is critical in the artriographic evaluation of the\\ncarotid and vertebrobasilar system as well. Adequate visualization of the\\n‘innominate, subclavian, and vertebral arteries demands that exposures be\\n‘bvained in projection planes which clearly oustine the origin of these vesels.\\n\\n2\\n',\n",
       " '[Especially forthe vertebral artery this frequently requires multiple oblique\\n‘projections. Not only are muitiplane projections exential for evaluating the\\n‘origin ofthe vertebral artery from the subelavian artery, but in the straight\\ncervical segment of the vertebral artery, atherosclerosis tends t0 develop eo-\\ncentrically and in relation 1 osteo-arthrti deformation of the cervical vete-\\nbac. When this occurs the artery may appear normal inthe lateral projection\\n‘and only anteroposterior or oblique views will permit an appreciation of the\\n‘extent of involvement.\\n\\n‘Secondly an optimal visualization of atherosclerosis often requires that\\ninjection of contrast is performed as close as posible tothe area under inves-\\ntigation to ensure that adequate dye concentrations are reached i the region\\n‘of interest For the arteriographie evaluation of the posterior circulation this\\n‘demands views of the aortic arch aswell as Selective injections f the ingom-\\nnate, subclavian and sometimes even of the vertebral arteries. To detect le-\\nsions of the vertebal arteries, especially of the ostia and proximal pars,\\n‘careful investigation with selective injection of the subclavian arteries and\\nuse of cineroenigenography is imperative. This is caused by the complex\\n‘anatomy ofthe veriebral arteries. On both sides the ostium and the vey fist\\nproximal segment ofthe vertebral artery are generally located on the dorsal\\n‘Side of the subclavian arery just proximal to its most cranial part. Usually the\\nbest exposures of the proximal part ofthe vertebral arteries will be realized\\nwith obique projections with the central ray angled in acraniocaudal direc:\\ntion. Often projections adjusted to individual anatomic variations are nec\\n‘essary. In a series of 100 cases Ludwig and his colleagues (1984) showed that\\nVisualization of atherosclerotic lesions atthe ostium or inthe proximal part of\\nthe vertebral artery was more than 3.5 times beter when they administered\\nsubclavian artery injection ie conjunction with video-recording compared\\nwith aortic arch injection ony.\\n\\nWhile itis recognized that atherosclerotic disease of the verlebrobasilar\\nanetal system may be responsible fr symptoms of cerebral ischaemia in\\n‘many patients, a critical analysis with regard ro the accuracy of aterographic\\n<etinition of atherosclerotic lesions inthis pat ofthe cerebral vascular tee Is\\nlacking.

It is this aspect of arteriography\\nwich is being reviewed increasingly more critically withthe recognition that\\nthe interpretation of diret morphological information may differ from one\\n‘observer to another and even between the same observer on different cca:\\nsions. This inter- and intraobserver varity of interpretation largely origi\\n‘nates from the fact that under most circumstances qualitative information is\\nassessed. Recognition of this fact has prompted the development of new\\n‘approaches which attempt to derive quantitative information a8 8 means of\\n‘redcing this variability. While this approach has been investigated exten\\nvely in coronary arteriography (Ziret al, 1976, Brown et al., 1977), and\\nAaortography (Bruins Slot eta, 198) it has mot been widely employed in\\narteriographic studies of the cerebral vascular tee.\\n\\nCChikos and co-workers (1983) determined in a prospective manner the\\ninter- and intraobserver variability in measuring the amount of diameter\\n‘eduction produced by plaques of the carotid bifurcation.

In\\n‘order to compare both methods and to determine the inter- and intraobserver\\nagreement he used valves of Kappa, a measure of agreement for categorical\\ndaa in a two-way table, corrected for chance.

(2) The vertebral arteries\\nin their bony canal are rather inaccessible, are commoaly asymmetrical in\\nsize, and, more often than the carotis, subject to anomalous origin.

As with the\\n‘examination ofthe caroid arteries, the vessel of intrest i directly interroga-\\nted by holding the Doppler probe over the artery and orientatng it until the\\nudio-Doppler signal is obtained and maximized. Much of the kill of the\\n‘examination consists of listening 1 this audio signal and trying to deter\\nfrom its characteristics, a6 well asthe positioning of the probe, whether\\ndocs in fact arse from the vessel of interest. Moreover the examination of\\nthe vertebral artery suffers from two main restrictions. Firstly, alarge part of\\nthe artery is inaccessible o ultrasound, being obscured by bone in its cervical\\nsegment. Secondly, the presence of numerous other vesels, especially inthe\\nlower neck, makes difficult to be sre thatthe Doppler signal detected does\\nin fact arse from the vertebral artery. Concerning the first ofthese difficul-\\nties, most workers have largely confined their efforts o examining the artery\\nclther low in the neck, before itentrs its bony canal, or jst below the base of\\n‘the skull as it winds around the lateral mass ofthe atlas. On the other hand,\\nKeller and co-workers (1976) developed a transoral approach with the tans.\\n‘ducer ofa directional Doppler flow meter in the anaesthetized lateral wall of\\nthe pharynx. Because the spatial relationship beween the probe andthe vessel\\naxis is known, the flow direction can be used as an additional diagnostic\\nmeasurement. However, patient discomfort and swallowing artifacts have\\nnot made this a popular procedure. In order to overcome the second diff\\nculty, that of distinguishing the vertebal artery from neighbouring or over.\\nlying vessels, many authors pointed out that sucha distnetion could be made\\nfrom systemic arteries that supply high-rsistantvascuatures bythe fact that\\nthe vertebral artery has significant antegrade flow during diastole, because i\\nsupplies the low-resstance vasculature ofthe brain, However, inthe case of &\\n‘marked hypoplasia or tight stenosis in the intradural segment of the vertebral\\nartery this will bea misleading characteristic, Moreover the distinction of the\\nvertebral artery from the internal carotid artery or branches of an external\\ncarotid artery can be improved when recordings are made only from arteries\\nin which flow persists during compression ofthe common carotid artery on\\nthe same side,\\n\\n‘The investigation of the proximal, prevertebral segment of the vertebral\\nartery is possible (Barnes etal, 1978, Hennerii et al., 1981, Ringelsten,\\n\\n61\\n',\n",
       " '1984) the overlying common carotid artery is manually displaced medialy\\n‘The procedure has the obvious advantage thatthe signals are recorded from\\nthe vicinity of possible stenoses, since most stenoses occur atthe origin of the\\nvertebral artery from the subclavian artery. Corson and co-workers (1977)\\nescrbed an alternative technique fr the no-invasve study of the vertebral\\narteries. They placed the probe ofa directional Doppler flow meter over the\\n‘Chassignac tubercle, which isthe well-developed anterior tubercle of the\\ntransverse process of the sixth cervical vertebra. The probe is then directed\\n‘medially, inferioriy, and posterioely, and the vertebral artery is found just\\nbefore it enters its bony canal\\n\\nProbably all these techniques are difficult because nly afew authors have\\n‘escred succesful results.

From this postion, how\\nver its often dificult to determine whether the afferent or efferent section\\nOf the atlantic segment ofthe vertebral artery is insonated bythe ultrasonic\\n‘beam. Therefor, itis not possible (0 determine the direction of flow with\\n‘certainty by only using the Doppler sonographic curves. This can be done by\\nfunctional tests, as for example, postichacmic hyperacmia produced by in-\\nAating a blood pressure cuff on the upper arm above sysolic pressure for wo\\n‘minutes, and releasing the cu rapidly.\\n\\n‘All he non-imaging Doppler techniques described above used continous\\nsave devices and thus have no range revolution. White and co-workers (1980)\\n“developed « pulsed Doppler system witha simle channel that could be varied\\njm both duration and range- Recordings were first made from the common\\n‘arotid arteries, Without moving the probe the gate was then advanced by a\\ntime corresponding to depth of one centimeter, which corresponds to the\\n‘depth ofthe vertebral artery in Hs bony canal, The audio Doppler signal of\\nthe carotid artery disappears during this procedure and another arterial signal\\nsmay be heard. To prove tha this signal infact originates from the vertebral\\nartery the probe is then rotated around the trandsducer face in the long axis\\nff the neck in a cranial and caudal direction. Ifthe signal disappears or\\n‘reappears after rotation moves the beam above or below the obscuring trans-\\nverse process ofa cervical vertebra, the operator can be reasonably sure that\\n‘he sanal docs originate from the vertebral artery. Although the authors\\n<ecided that recording vertebral artery flow by this technique was usualy 8\\nsimple and easily learned procedure, was wot always possible to ensure that\\n‘the signals were originated from the vertebral artery.

A second deficiency of this technique resulted\\n‘rom the fact thatthe vertebral arteries are only displayed in segments oftheir\\ncourse between the transverse processes of the vertebrae in the midcervcal\\nregion, while stenoses occur near the origin ofthe vertebral artery from the\\nsubclavian artery, Subsequently they adopted the technique originally de-\\nscribed by Spencer and co-workers. In this way they were able to image the\\n‘origin ofthe vertebral aneries, but once again the technique was difficult and\\nit was impossible to complete a scan sucesfully in a Significant mamber of\\npatients\\n\\nWood and Mie (1980, 1983) described a 30 channel pulsed Doppler divec-\\ntional system with which they made images of the arch vesels and vertebral\\narteries.

The former was of course biased by the relatively high number\\nof subclavian arteries without significant disease (133). Nevertheless, in four\\narteries with a stenosis of S0% or more no disturbances were found in the\\n‘onagrams withthe duplex scanner. The reason for this was the fact that in\\n{his study we could not perform a Doppler measurement ia the most proximal\\n‘part ofthe wbclavian artery, even om the right side, This was an extra mot\\n‘Hon to image the innominate bifurcation in the nex study.\\n\\n‘However the major problem was the relative high numberof false positive\\n‘resis.

Therefore, 8 major furare role for some non\\nInvasive procedures may be the application inthe detection and assesment of\\natherosclerosis in ts presymptomatic phase by measuring rates of growth or\\nchange.

These thre diagnostic procedures are now used\\nin our hospital as screening tests in patients suspected of exra- and intact\\nnial atherosclerotic disease. For a better understanding of the interaction of\\n‘these tests and the possibilities and limitations they wil each be discussed here\\nbriefly. Asa mater of routine by means ofthese diagnostic tess we attempt\\nto be informed about the satus of the carotid snd insominate subclavian\\nvertebral arterial systems exracramially ad itracranialy i all patents.\\n\\n“The asseriment of atherosclerosis of the carotid syatem and is potential\\n<olatral circulation by ocular preumoplethysmography (OPG Gee) has been\\ndescribed by Bikelboom (1981). Ocular pneamoplethysmography isa simple\\n‘and accurae (es o trace a pressure reducing stenosis inthe carotid areal\\nsystem from the level of the aorta tothe intracranial internal cared artery.\\nThe transition zone from non-presure reducing 1 prewure reducing or hac-\\nsmodyeamically significant stenosis appeared 10 be from 60% 10 70% trans\\nverse diameter reduction. For the sake of convenccnce, stenosis with a di-\\nameter reduction of 8% of more and occlusions ae considered as haemody-\\n‘namically significant. However, its nt posible o determine at which level\\nthe obstructive lesion is located nor ist possible vo predict the severity ofthe\\nlesion by ocular pneumoplethysmography. The most important application\\n‘hen determining a patient's collateral circulation wil be its possible use in\\nrecognizing the stroke prone patient. Routinely the collateral circulation is\\ntested by manual compression of the caro arteries ring ocular pcumo:\\nplethysmography as well as elecroencephalography. The clinical significance\\n(of these diagnostic tests can ony be evaluated in a prospective study, because\\nthe collateral circulation in stroke patients wth ocluded caroid arteries may\\n‘be unreliable due 10 possible improvement of the collateral circulation after\\n‘the oclusion (Liebman etal, 1981). However, in a prospective study Moll\\n(1984) showed thatthe collateral optthalmic artery pressure did not change\\nsignificantly when a pressure reducing stenosis developed on the same sde in\\nthe carotid artery.\\n\\n‘The technique capable of imaging the small contrast levels produced after\\n‘an intravenous injection of contrast material was fist described by Misiretta\\n‘and co-workers in 1973. Later the inttoduction of a digital videomae proc\\n‘essor made this subtraction technique suitable for clinical use and in partic-\\n\\n138\\n\",\n",
       " '‘lar for intravenous angiography of the cerebral arteries (Strother etl.\\n1980, Chicote et a..1981). Since then, the use ofthis technique has been met\\nwith great enthusiasm as an javasive technique with litle hazard and most\\nity for the delineation of atherosclerotic ineaein many vascular areas. The\\naccuracy and limitations ofthis technique ia the evaluation of atherosclerotic\\ncerebral vascular diease had been described by many investigators (es\\n‘Chilote etal, 1981, Wood eta, 1983, Earnest eta, 1983, Folcareli eta.\\n1983, Hoffman eta, 1984), Avoidance of arterial catheterization and pe\\nformance on an outpatient basis accounted forthe widespread acceptance of\\n{intravenous digital subtraction angiography for the assessment of atheros\\nrotic disease of the carotid bifurcation. Some reports (Lusby et al, 1982,\\nFolcarelli etal, 1983) seem to indicate that clinical decisions regarding oper-\\n‘ative or non-operative treatment in many patients with carotid artery disease\\n‘ean be made solely on the bass ofthe data of this technique. On the other\\n‘hand it has some inberent limitations. The mos impertant are: poot quality\\nOf the images by swallow artifacts of overall artifact, incompleteness of,\\ninformation by overiying of the external carotid or vertebral arteries, and\\n‘poor arterial contrast density secondary to poor cardiac function. Moreover,\\nitis very important to visualize the vessel of interest adequately in mote than\\n‘on projection. Hoffman and colleagues (1984) reviewed the examination ofa\\nroutine cerebrovascular study and showed that in 42% of their cases the\\nimages of the carotid bifurcation were diagnostically of sufficient quality\\n‘These difficulties may require multiple anteroposterior and oblique views in\\n‘many patients. This can result in the adminstration of large volumes of\\n‘coniast material which may compromise renal function especially in the\\n‘elderly patient. Another important limitation of intravenous digital subtrac=\\n‘thom angiography isthe lower spatial resolution compared with conventional\\narteriography. Although intracranial vascular examinations, such asa search\\nfor deviations or occlusions of the carotid syphon or the basilar artery, are\\n‘readily applicable, the examinations afe often of insufficiemt qualiy 10 detect\\n‘intracranial vascular disease (Earnest tal, 1983)\\n\\nTtravenous digital subtraction angiography was introduced in our hospital\\nJn October 1980. De Vries (1984) investigated the accuracy ofthis technique\\nand of conventional contrast arteriography inthe evaluation of atherosclero-\\ntic disease of the carotid bifurcation by means of intra- and interobserver\\nagreement, expressed in Kappa values.\\n\\nThe concept of combining a pulsed-echo system and a palsed Doppler\\nsystem into a so-called duplex scanner was fist described by Barber and co-\\n‘workers (1974. Since its initial development the system has undergone con-\\ntinwous modifications to make it usuable in clinical practice. This sequence\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'followed by the results of many other investigators (Le. Blackshear al,\\n1979, 1980, Fell eral, 1981, Breslau, 1982, Zbornikova et al..1982, Langlois\\netal, 1983),\\n\\n‘We introduced this technique in our hospital in May 1981. In combination\\nwith realtime spectral analysis of the Doppler signals, ultrasonic duplex\\n‘scanning appeared to bea reliable diagnostic procedure for the detection of\\n‘theroscleronis ofthe internal and external carotid arteries (Ackertalf ct al\\n1982). Its most striking failure was its poor results in classifying normal\\n‘vessels and those with minor lesions. The duplex scanner overestimated the\\ndegree of disease in such cases. This problem can partly be solved by the use\\nfof transucers wat a more appropriate focal arrangement and smaller sample\\n‘volumes (Knox et al, 1982, van Merode et al, 1983) or by the combinat\\n‘of a maltigated pulsed Doppler and a high resolution B-scanner(Hennerici et\\n‘A, 1988). High resolution rel time witrasonie imaging (7.$ or 10 MHz trans-\\n{ducer of the carotid bifurcation can expecaly provide valuable anatomical\\ninformatioe about plague morphology and sometimes ulcerations can be\\ndetected (Cooperberg tal, 1979, Ringsstein et al, 1982, James eal, 1982,\\nKatz tal, 1983, Reily etal, 1984). Since the increased axial reslution\\n‘obtained by using transducers with relative high sominal frequencies results\\nim increased absorbtion ofthe wound waves and limited depth penetration, the\\ninvestigation of deeper located vesels, such as the prevertebral segment of\\nthe vertebral artery and the branches ofthe aortic arc, s usually impractica-\\nble with these transducers, Moreover, because reflections rom the vse! wall\\nare poor if the angle ofthe ultrasound beam snot perpendicular the exam\\nination ofthe often tortuous, smaller and more deeply located prevertebral\\nsegment ofthe vertebral artery can only be performed satisfactorily with a\\ntelative small ransdcer witha rounded surface. Such a transducer is more\\n‘handsome and easier to manipulate. By using the standard mechanical sector\\n‘carnners of our system it was relatively easy to find the vertebral artery just\\n‘proximal tothe transverse process of the sath cervical vertebra, t0 follow the\\n‘rtery ints prevertebral segment froma distal to proximal postion and to\\nfind is origin from the subclavian artery. The investigation ofthe cervical\\n‘segment of the vertebral artery, the most proximal part of the right common\\n‘carotid artery, and the subclavian and innominate arieries was also posible\\n‘ith the same transducer in most of the patients. Our experiences withthe\\nrecently developed 7.5 MH and the multifrequency (3, 5, and 7.5 MH)\\ntranducers are encouraging. The investigation of the ostiam and the most\\n‘rosimal part ofthe vertebral is especially practicable with these transducers\\n\\n140\\n',\n",

THE IMPACT OF RECENTLY DEVELOPED DIAGNOSTIC\\nPROCEDURES IN THE EVALUATION OF CEREBRAL\\nATHEROSCL EROTIC DISEASE ON THE MANAGEMENT OF\\nPATIENTS\\n\\ntwill be clear thatthe aforementioned techniques used by us inthe evalua-\\ntion of atherosclerotic disease ofthe cevebeovascular te all have thei ind\\nvidual posites and limitations. In our opinion, only the consistent use of\\n‘them a5 a battery of sreening tests makes it possible to be adequately and\\ntellably informed about the status of the extra and intracranial cerebral\\narteries in most of the patients without the use of intra-arterial contrast an\\nsiography. This invasive diagnostic procedure will only be performed by win\\nsymptomatic patients if there i significant disagreement between the data of\\n‘cular pneumoplethysmography, carotid compresion tests, intravenous dh\\ntal sobiraction angiography and ultrasonic duplex scanning. This is also the\\n«ave ifthe cinial findings make more detailed information necesary about a\\npart of the cerebrovascular tre with special interes, such asthe ostia of the\\nvertebral arteries or the intracranial arteries, This policy resulted in a reduc-\\ntion of the number of conventional contrast arterigzams performed 00\\ntients suspecied of cerebrovasclat atherosclerosis of about 40% ducing the\\nfirst year and about 99% during the second year (de Vries, 1984. Previously,\\nhhowever, we compared the data of intravenous digital subaction an-\\nAiography and wleasonic duples scaring with those of conventional conttast,\\narteriography with regard to their acuracy in quanciying internal carotid\\nartery disease (ikelboon ta, 1983). This tudy show combi\\n\\nton of intravenous dipkal subtraction angiography and ultrasonic duplex\\n‘scanning it was possible 1 identity both noemal vessels and those wih differ\\nent degrees of disease Involvement with accepable accuracy as compared\\nWith contrast arterlography. Moreover, forthe lst two years we used the\\nsame parameter as described by Knox and co-workers (1982-b) to grade ob-\\n‘structive lesions inthe Imernalcaroud artery with a diameter reduction of\\n50% oF more in three subgroups, namely: SO64M%, 65.89% and 90.99%\\n\\niameter reduction. Although out resus scem to provide a useful method in\\nclinical practice, further evaluation is necessary to compare these results with\\n‘those of ocular pnewmoplethysmography and conventional contras arterio-\\nraphy. Since we started this tady in 1983 rex\\n\\nid will be soon published\\n‘Cereb\\n1 the innominate-subelavia\\n‘matic and asymptomatic patients. Usually, however the physicians\\n‘well informed of the cistrbution of atherosclerotic lesions over both systems.\\n[AL the same time, i is well known that in patients with diffuse and severe\\n\\noy\\n',\n",
       " '“atherosceronis ofthe cerebral vesels the interdependence of the anterior and\\nposterior circulations may be very important for the final outcome of the\\npatient In the frst place, this interdependence will be defined by the circle of\\nWillis. Secondly n the event ofa functionally wel developed posterior com:\\n‘municating artery on one or both sides, this interdependence will epend 00\\nthe degree of atherosclerosis of both the carotid and innominate subclavian\\n‘vertebral arterial systems inracranally and exracranialy. In such cases with\\nsevere obstructive disease ofthe carotid arteries a vertebral artery may serve\\n{2 major collateral channel of the cerebral circulation. Moreover, in pa-\\ntients with complete separation of the anteiot and posterior circulations,\\nspecially pressure reducing stenoses of the innominate, subclavian or verte-\\n‘bral artery may caus transient or permanent neurological deficit inthe verte\\n‘brobasiar territory. The diffuse distribution of cerebral atherosclerosis and\\nthe complesity of its pathology ensured our search fora safe and accu\\niagnostic procedure which could play a potentially powerful role in the\\n‘valuation of atherosclerosis of the innominate, subclavian and vertebral\\narterien We tried to evaluate atheroscierons of these vesses by ultratonic\\nuplen scanning.\\n\\n‘We stated with ultrasonic duplex scanning of the carotid arteries in May\\n1981, After a learning phase of four months we also wied to investigate the\\nsubclavian arteries and the most proximal part ofthe vertebral arteries on\\nboth sides. The results of ultrasonic duplex scanning of these arteries as\\n‘compared with contrast arteriography were so encouraging (Ackerta et\\n1984) that we decided 10 investigate on both sides the extracranal part ofthe\\ncerebrovascular tree as completely as possible, During the period of the se-\\n‘cond study, from December 1982 19 October 1984, we routinely investigated\\nthe innominate, subelavian, internal and external carotid arteries and te\\n‘preveribral segment of the vericbral arteries. The investigation of the cerv-\\n‘al segment ofthe vertebral artery was only performed if the refersng phys\\nGan requested it or ifthe pateet had a history of vertebrobasilar insuffi\\n‘ency. The interaction between atherosclerotic lesions and displacement oF\\n‘obstruction ofthe verebral artery by cervical spondylosis was especially eva-\\nuated for this segment. The cervical segment of the vertebral artery was also\\nroutinely investigated between the transverse processes of the second and first\\nCervical vertebrae. However, tn obvious relation between abnoemal sons:\\nfram recorded inthis part ofthe vertebral artery and rotation of the head\\n‘sas not found. In some patients with diffuse and severe ateroxcerote dis\\n‘ease of the cerebral arteries abnormally high and turbulent Doppler signals\\n‘were found in the vertebral artery at the level ofthe atlanio-axial articulation,\\nMoreover, we evaluated the significance of wltrasonic duplex scanning of the\\nvertebral artery in the event of a severe obstructive lesion in the intradural\\nsegment of this artery Finally, forthe sake of completeness we also noted the\\n‘number of patients witha subclavian or innominate steal syndrome.\\n\\nwz\\n\\n',\n",
       " '10.4, ULTRASONIC DUPLEX SCANNING OF THE INNOMINATE,\\nSUBCLAVIAN, AND VERTEBRAL ARTERIES\\n\\n1 was not possible to image the origin of the innominate artery from the\\n‘oti arch in any of the 1122 patents investigated during the second study\\nHowever investigation ofthe distal part ofthis artery was usually 90 prob\\nJem. In only 14% of the patients the investigation ofthe innominate artery\\n‘was not possible at all. In most of these patients the proximal part of thi\\nartery was located too deeply. Only afew patients (0.254%, Daseler, 199) will\\n‘have an abnormal origin ofthe right subclavian artery directly (rom the aortic\\narch distal tothe origin ofthe left subclavian artery. AS the investigation of\\n‘the innominate artery was only practicable in its most distal part in general\\nthe Doppler signals were recorded 2-4 centimeters distal tits origi fm the\\n‘aortic arch. Usually, however atherosclerotic lesions are located i the most\\n‘proximal pat of th innominate artery, very cos 1 its origin. Disturbances\\n(of the shape ofthe sonagrams recorded distal o a stenoais return to normal\\nfurther downstream. In general the less severe the stenosis the more rapid\\n‘this transition takes plac. In the cae of a stenosis with a diameter reduction\\n‘of $0 to 6% at the site ofthe origin of the inaominate artery the disturbed.\\nsonagrams will return to normal approximately three centimeters down\\n‘stream (Reneman et al., 1979), in other words justin the distal part ofthe\\ninnominate artery. Therefore, atherosclerotic lesions ofthe innominate artery\\nWith a diameter reduction of ess than 50% will sully not give diturbed\\nsignals in the distal part ofthis artery and will not be detected with ultrasonic\\nduplex seannin.\\n\\nInvestigation of the subclavian arteries was peacticable in almost all pa-\\ntients. In the fist study, in which the data ofthe right andthe left side were\\n‘not separated, the resuls of ultrasonic duplex seanning were of insufficient\\n‘quality in 7 of 163 subclavian arteries (4%), Duting the second study the\\ninvestigation was impracticable in only one patient (0.9%) on the right side\\n‘and in none ofthe patents on the lft side, In this patient the revults were\\n‘unreliable because ofa significant stenosis ofthe innominate artery. In such\\ncases it may be difficult to distinguish the flow disturbances as induced bythe\\nlesion of the innominate artery from the disturbances induced by a possible\\nsecond lesion atthe ste ofthe origin of the ight subclavian artery ln spite of\\nthese few failures, ultrasonic duplex scanning ofthe right subclavian artery\\nwas the most dificult part ofthe investigation ofthe vessel of the arch of the\\n‘orca. The most proximal par of the right subclavian artery makes a postero-\\nlaxeral curve and, in spite of many efforts the axis of the Doppler beam\\nremained perpendicular 1 the aus of the veel and 2 Doppler meassrement\\n\\nthe most proximal part of this artery was impracticable in about 30% of\\nthe patients.

According o our exper\\nence atherosclerotic lesions of the lelt subclavian artery were more diffusely\\nlocated in the proximal pat of this artery than inthe right subclavis\\n‘In many patients the lesions expanded towards the ste of the o\\nleft verebral artery. This was probably the reason for the re\\n‘number of false negative results in the investigation of the left subelavian\\nancry.\\n\\nThe investigation ofthe vertebeal artery was more complicated and as the\\nmajority of atherosclerotic lesions of the extracranial part ofthe posterior\\nCirculation was located at the ste of is origin this part of uliasonic duplex\\nscanning ofthe cerebral arteries needs extra attention. During the period of\\nthe first study there was no experience with ultrasonic duplex scanning ofthe\\nvertebral arteries. The management of the patient and the performance of\\ncontrast arteriography was not biased by the results of ultrasonic duplex\\nscanning. Homever,during the last year of the second study there was an\\nIncreasing interest and confidence in ultrasonic duplex scanning and espe\\nally vertebral contrast arteriography was biased by the results of this non\\n‘invasive technique. This is reflected by the increasing percentage of the vere\\nbral arteries with a stenosis of 09% or more a the site ofthe ostium (from\\n16.7% to 22.8%) and the increased number of occluded vertebral arteries\\n(from 8 0 20) An important point to emphasize here is that only during the\\nsecond study an investigation was made of the prevertebral segment of the\\nvertebral artery along its whole legis to ensue thatthe Dopplr signals were\\n‘ot mistakenly recorded from another branch of the subclavian artery, such\\n1 the thyrocervcal trunk. Depending on local anatomical properties the\\ninvestigation of the preverebral segment of the vertebral artery was more\\n‘complicated on the left than on the right sie. In general, ultrasonic duplex\\n‘scanning of the ostium ofthe vertebral artery was impracticable in 22% ofthe\\n‘cases. This happened in more than three quarters of the cases oa the left side\\nInanother $6 of the cases ultrasonic duplex scanning of the ostium of the\\nvertebral artery was no problem, but the artery showed high flow or very ow\\nflow velocities. The results ofthe second study showed that itis inadvisable to\\n‘decide upon the state ofthe ostium in such cases. The accuracy in detecting an\\n‘occluded vertebral artery increased significantly during the four years ofthe\\nstady, Inthe fist period between May 1981 and December 1982 we usually\\n‘ould not image an occluded vertebral artery, We were confronted with the\\n\\n14\\n',\n",

Over the last two yeas intra-arterial contrast arerio-\\nraphy had seldom been used by us to complete diagnostic information i=\\nPatients with aterosceross ofthe caroti arteries. On the other hand, con\\n‘ventional contrast arteriograpy was sill necessary for teliable diagnostic a-\\nformation about the innominate, subclavian, and vertebral arteries. In out\\n‘opinion, smzavenous digital subraction angiography only gives an overall\\nimpression about this part of the cerebral aneies. More accutate information\\nfor example, bout the ostium or the cervical segment ofthe vertebral arteries\\n‘isnot possi with this technique in most of the patients. Investigators like\\nRinglscin (1988) demonstrated that contiauous wave Doppler sonography\\ncan be very helpful for a reliable nos invasive evaluation of atherosclerotic\\nisease ofthe posterior circulation. Because of the limited data available, an\\n‘extensive comparison between the use of continuous wave Doppler and ultra:\\nsonic duplex scanning is not possible at the present sate of the art. In oar\\n‘opinion, anatomical information about the vessel of interest is cscatial in a\\ncomplicated vascular bed such asthe innominate-subclavian-verebalareriat\\nsystem. Therefore, we prefer the combination of ultrasonic imaging and pul-\\nsed Doppler sonograpty with rel time spectral analysis asa routine diagnos-\\ntic technique for the investigation of the innominate, subclavian, and verte.\\nbral arteries. At present continuous wave Doppler sonography is only perfor:\\n‘med in patints with a stenosis with a diameter reduction of $0% or more in\\n‘the internal carotid artery in order 1 be informed of the dicection of flow in\\nthe peri-orbital arteries.\\n\\n“This study shows that in patients in whor the investigation is posible,\\n‘lrasonic duplex scanning s usable and reasonably reliable diagnoste (00\\n‘in the assesment of wierosclerotic lesions of the innominate subclavian ver\\n‘ebral arterial sytem.

The alm ofthe study is to determine the accuracy of utrasonic duplex\\n‘scanning ofthe innominate, subclavian, and vertebral arteries in patients with\\ncerebral atherosclerosis. For this purpose the results of ulrasonic duplex\\n‘canning were compared with those of contrast arteriographs. Betweca May\\n1981 and Oxtober 1984 2770 duplex examinations were performed in 1972\\npatients atthe department of clinical neurophysiology of the St. Antonius\\nospital, Newwepein, The Netherlands.\\n\\nChapter?\\n\\n{Im this chapter a review of the anatomy of the aortic arch, arch vessel,\\n‘vertebral and basilar arteries is given.

A review is\\n{given of the principle sts of atheroscleotc obstructive change in these ae\\nries. The clinical implication ofthe differences in morphology and structure\\nfof atherosclerotic leons in the cat and innominate subclavian vertebral\\narterial systems is bei outlined. Its noticed that vertebrobasilar insutf-\\nciency isnot a homogenous entity. It inclades a variety of vascular patholo-\\n{ies at various locations, with diverse pathogenetic mechanisms, and with\\n<ifferent clinical prognosis. Fortis reason it is not surprising that the opin-\\nfons on the therapeutic results of carotid endarterectomy inthis group of\\npatients greatly vary.

Therefore, a com:\\nDrehensive review of the symptomatology of transient ischaemic attacks in\\nthe vertebrobasilar territory is given inthe first section ofthis chapter. The\\n‘cervical segments of the vertebral arteries ae the only parts ofthe cerebral\\nvascular tree which are functionally related to degenerative osteo-athiti\\nchange of the spinal column. Therefor, the anatomical considerations and\\npathogenesis of spondylosis of the cervical column and its significance in\\nvertebrobasilar arterial insufficiency are described. The last section of this\\n‘chapter deals with the pathogenesis and clinical manifestations of the subela\\nvian steal syndrome.\\n\\nChapters\\n\\n‘A short historical review is given of cerebral contrast arteriography and in\\nparticular of vertebral arteriography. In addition 10 this the complications of\\ncarotid and selective vertebral arteriography and the accuracy of conventio-\\n‘al contrast arteriography and inravenoas digital subtraction anpiography\\nare summarized. The next section of this chapter deals with non-invasive\\ndiagnostic techniques used i the dagnonis of atherosclerotic disease of the\\n‘nnominate-subelavian-verebral arterial system. The non-imaging and imag-\\ning Doppler techniques a well as real-time ultrasonic scanning ofthis par of\\nthe cerebrovascular ree are discussed.

During the study two types of\\nsean beads are wsed, the medium focus scan head apd the short focus scan\\nhead. The spatial resolution ofboth scan heads is evaluated and the influence\\n‘ofthe sizeof the sample volumes on the quality ofthe Doppler signals and,\\n‘consequent, the interpretation ofthe special wave forms is discussed. Fi\\nrally, the technique of signal modulation-demodulation and procesing\\nsummative.\\n\\nChapter 8\\n\\nUtirasonic duplex scanning ofboth the carotid and the innominate -subela-\\nvian-ertebral arterial ystem is described. The possibilities and limitations of\\n‘the investigation of each of these segments of the cerebral vascular {16 is\\n‘iscumed. This chapter also describes the Doppler paramcters wed for &\\n‘Quantitative assessment of atherosclerotic obstractive lesions in the inom\\nnate, subclavian, and vertebral arteries.\\n\\nChapter 9\\n\\n‘This chapter describes our results of ultrasonic duplex scanning of the\\nlnorinate,subslavian, and vertebral arteries, For each of these vessels the\\nFesuls of the non-invasive technique ate compared with the results of con-\\ntas arteriography and they are reviewed separately. Fits, however, the\\nmethod of atsuument ofthe percentage of stenonis used in this study andthe\\nstatistical analysis ofthe dara are described.\\n\\n‘Two studies form the basis of the evaluation of the data of ultrasonic\\nduplex scanning. During the first study we only investigated the proximal\\nsegment of the sbelavian and vertebral arteries. During the second study we\\nalso investigated the innominate artery and the cervical segment of the verte:\\ntral artery. In 14% of the patients a non-invasive investigation of ve inom\\nrate artery was impracticable and in 22% of the cases it was not possible 10\\ndecide upon the state of the origin of the vertebral artery. Mosily a deep\\nlocation ofthe relevant part ofthe cerebral vasculature made the now-inva:\\nsive vestigation impracticable. Therefore, the hereby mentioned accuracy\\n‘only counts in those cases in whom the examination was sucesful. The ac\\n‘acy of ulirasonic duplex scanning ofthe innominate and subclavian arteries\\n‘swell as the ostium of the vertebral arteries is expresied in sensitivity speci=\\nficity, postive prediive value, negative predictive value, and overall acu\\n‘acy. Most of these parameters show that ultrasonic duplex scanning of these\\n\\n130\\n',\n",
       " 'segments of the cerebrovascular tre can be used as a reliable screening ves i\\npatients with cerebral atherosclerosis. However, the sensitivity fr identifying\\n4 stenosis with a diameter reduction of $O% oF more atthe ste ofthe origin\\n‘of the right sublavian artery is 100 low (0.43), Moreover, the positive predic\\n‘ive vale of ultrasonic duplex scanning ofthe ostium ofthe vertebral artery\\n(0.65) needs improvement. A possible explanation is given forthe false me\\nlative and false postive tex reuits of ultrasonic duplex scanning for each of\\nthe separate arteries. In particular a high-flow or low-flow state ofthe verte:\\nbral artery makes a reliable diagnosis ofan obstructive lesion in this artery\\nvery dificult, In addition, the results ofthe second study show that in exper\\n‘enced hands the dffeentation between hypoplasia and occasion ofthe verte-\\nbral artery i very well posible, The investigation of the cervical segment of,\\nthe vertebral artery is only performed ifthe patient had a hatory af vetebro-\\nbasilar insffikency or if it was requested by the referring physician, Espe>\\ncially for this pat of the vertebral artery the relation between osteo-artitic\\nSpurs caused by cervical spondylosis and displacemeat or obstruction of the\\nvertebral artery is evaluated. Although the numberof patients with abnorma-\\nlites i the cervical segment ofthe vertebra artery is small ultrasonic duplex\\nscanning of the cervical segment appeared tobe a reliable test. The signi\\n‘ance of ultrasonic duplex scanning of the vertebral artery in the event of &\\n\\never, obstructive lesion in the intradural segment of this artery is also eval:\\n‘uated, The interpretation ofthe morphology of the soaagrams recorded in an\\nInuracranally occluded vertebral artery appear to be more complicated than\\nin the carotid system. Probably thsi the result of a greater variation inthe\\nterritory supplied with blood by an intracranial occluded vertebral artery.\\nFinally, the results of ulirasonic duplex scanning ofthe vertebral arteries in\\npatients with subclavian or innominate steal syndrome are reviewed, For\\nthis part of the stody we also use the data of intravenous dial subtraction\\nangiography.\\n\\nChapter 10\\n\\n‘This chapter outlines the potential power of intravenous digital subtraction\\nangiography and ultrasonic imaging in the assessment of atherorclrotic ds-\\n‘ease and in particular of atherosclerosis ofthe cerebral arteries. tn addition 19\\n‘this, the impact of ocular meumoplethysmopraphy, intravenous digital sub-\\ntraction angiography and ulirasonic duplex scanning on the management of\\npatients with atheroclrosis of the cerebral arteries in our hospital i dis-\\n‘cussed.
